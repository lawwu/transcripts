[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I'm going to go back to your meeting to go where Jack and Bill do what I call the Marcian
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   check. There's nothing structured or anything, they can just go wherever it takes them. So,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   I'll get out of the way and let's hear from Mr. Jack and Bill.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   I'm going to lead off with a question for you, Jack, which is you gave us your expected
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   asset class returns. And with stock returns, you have a term in your hand for the mean
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   reversion, which is the way it was set, and I'm familiar with that. And I noticed there
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   was the only mean reversion term in the bond series. I'm going to ask you why.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Okay, well, first I can't imagine anybody wants to hear me say anything more. I'm all
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   set out. But that's a good question. And that is, what's different about the mean
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   reversion in bonds? Well, we have mean reversion in stocks. We have dividend yield, and we
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   have earnings growth. And then we have, what's the 48th mean reversion? It's how much people
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   pay per dollar. In bonds, if you hold them as investments, not as you hold them in speculation,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   that doesn't matter. Almost all of the bonds return over time is accounted for by the interest
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   rate bond. It's not 95% where you hold them. You have 100% of the bond returns already
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   in the beginning. So there is no mean reversion. There would be a mean reversion. For example,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   it couldn't be. If you have a 30-year bond, from 10 years, it's great. It's going to be
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   higher at all where it lost at least 20 years ago. And I don't know how to predict that.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So my recommendation is I don't like the bond bonds because it fluctuates too much for me.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   The record is quite clear that the bond bonds pay higher returns in the intermediate and
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   short because we know that there are yields. The bond bonds yield more. And since the only
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   source of return from a bond is its yield, that's what you get at the end of the period.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   But there shouldn't be a mean reversion in the short period. If you buy a 10-year bond,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   then you'll have a 10-year return. More or less is more for me. But if you buy the total
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   bond index bond, can interest rates go from 3.5%, 4% to 10%? Your 10-year return should
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   be lower. Well, you have two factors. One, if interest rates go up, the price goes down,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   as we discussed at some point in the lunch and wine. But the return on your reinvestment
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   of those two bonds goes up. And if interest rates go down, the price goes up, but the
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   reinvestment goes down. They are more or less mostly law-setting factors. So I don't have
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   to complicate things too much when we try and guess what happens in shorter periods,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   which it can. And then you get this funny timing thing. For example, you buy this 10-year
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   bond, and it's only about 2.4%. But if interest rates go to 10%, the price of that bond will
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   plummet that day, or that week, or that month. And there's a difference in one half, whether
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   that half's on the first day you want it, or the last day you want it. Now, the bond
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   itself on the last day you want it, it only has one day, two days to maturity. So it changes
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   to a 10% return on the last day of maturity. So I'm just this merchant of simplicity. And
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I don't know if you get a 10% interest rate, which is certainly possible. If it happens
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   quickly, you have one hand in a bet. If it happens in the middle of a period, you have
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   another. If it happens at the end of the period, you get a point for another, or not. I think
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   it's complicated. So I just like to look at it and say, well, make the best judgment
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   you can. I should also say this, that there doesn't seem to be any difference between
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   the two. I'm not really critical of them. If we all need a Treasury bond, or a Treasury
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   bond, or a corporate bond, they have the same type of portfolio. You have an index bond,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   an intermediate index bond, and the intermediate index is shipping to us. It's time for money
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   to go out. That doesn't seem to matter, unless we take a look at the actual Treasury bond
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   return for that period, compared to the return on the bond. And the intermediate fund is
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   the intermediate return, compared to the return within, you know, close enough around the
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   portfolio, so to say. So I think maybe we over-indicate all those elements while we're
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   there. But I don't think we can afford a bet on whether interest rates go up 10% at a certain
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   time, which is pretty painful. Because even if we're right, that amount of time is just
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   too much gas to burn. In the long run, the odds, the correlation of the day-to-day yield
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   on that intermediate return portfolio, correlation over time, and they're remarkably, I think
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I've got this chart, is Kevin here? I think we have that chart in the new book, don't
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   we, Kevin? The 191% correlation chart. And it's very, very consistent, in that here's
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   the initial interest rate, and here's the return over the next 10 years, and the lines
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   are like this. They break out along those. So I think that's the best way to do it.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's interesting. What fascinated me was the chart we had run by decades, and enthusiasm
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   versus non-enthusiasm for stocks. And the one thing that struck me is, as I was coming
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   out, because I went through that bookstore and heard of the illustrator working in Chicago
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   at the intersection of the H and K Concourse, while I was on these phones and heading to
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   the Senate, I could not find one book there that I would call an investing book. Nothing
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   by you, nothing by Sue Jordan, nothing by Jim Cramer, and the CTO. I don't know if
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   there are any small deliriums. The closest that I could get was one or two of my senior
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   labs books. And what I kept out there, and this is just really anecdotal to me, is a
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   total lack of interest in investing among the general public. These people came in trusting
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   what we did, and they were interested, and now they're not interested. They shouldn't
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   be selling anything. I find that fairly bullshit.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Well, you know, the investment books that sell are those that promise riches, wealth
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   without risk. Peter Lynch's books, I think, sold well. At the time, he was doing very
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   well. I guess they're probably not doing so well now. And that's a whole other story
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   in and of itself. A good example of something that's got too big to do, I think, a lot of
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   them are surprised. You know when Magellan got $300 billion? It should have been an index
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   fund. I never should have been saying, "Well, he's right, but it was lost." But they got
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   to market time, and he overhauled that. And they got, like, a 25% cash position, and stocks
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   kept. 114% for the manager going up. And just one more example, hey, you can't put a manager
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   money in a big size. And they shouldn't try it. They've done all kinds of funny things,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and they're always late to do them. He was looking back, putting in an international
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   end much after his work. And so I'm going to turn to a few people. I'll tell you this.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I wrote a book there that I did, duh, again, 10 years ago, and put it out again 10 years
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   later. I mean, most of the books that were written 10 years ago were disasters. And people
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   at the bottom were just, "I don't know if people buy these books. I just hope they don't
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   do what the authors tell them to do." But then what's the point of buying books?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I mean, one of my favorite methods of estimating the level of risk premium is your method.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And so those are filling the shelves. You know the risk premiums, what the risk premiums
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   are. And then when you see, you know, what's the type of depression of 2015, how about
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   a real disaster, how about - well, you know the stock. The equity risk premium is fairly
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   high. The other question I have for you about response -
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   >>Let me just interject one second, though. You mentioned Dow 36,000. Not exactly a brilliant
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   exercise in market forecasting and timing. And so Jim Glassman has written another book,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   and it's called Dow 10,000. No, I'm kidding. It's not. He has a new theory, and it's called
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   "Margin of Safety." And he wants me to endorse it. And I shouldn't say to you, because you
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   may have sold, but I did, because I've known you guys for a long time, and I want to be
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   a nice guy. I did endorse Dow 36,000. But I said don't be deceived by the title. We're
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   going to get to 36,000. But it's going to be a long, long road, and a very bumpy one.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   So we'll probably get to 36,000. Some of that may be 2050. I don't know. 2035, maybe
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   a year and a half. But I don't think he wants me to endorse this one. I just don't know
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   what I'd do on it. I think one of the great triumphs of human optimism is that people
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   still use Jim Glassman. A triumph of over-experience. Yeah, I don't know. The triumph that he had,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Jack, that fascinated me the most, was the dollar-rated versus time-rated gap for the
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   ETS. And I don't know if you have these data, but what I'd be really interested to know
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   is, are the gaps bigger for the ETS than for the corresponding funds? If you take those
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   landlord funds that have lower classes, is the gap higher for the ETS than the investor
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   in a lot more cash shares, the old cash shares? That's a very good question. Actually, we
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   looked at it, and I decided not to use the chart. Not because it did not show what you
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   would expect. It showed loans in stronger hands than the ETF. But rather, we had some
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   struggle with getting the numbers right, that the money goes out of the investor class and
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   into the admiral class. So it will be done, and Kevin and I are going to do some work
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   on that. But in your intuition, and in this case I think it's usually right, and in this
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   case I think it is right, is the gap. And we've done this earlier. We've said a couple
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   of things about statistical methodology. It showed very clearly the gap was much smaller
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   than the ADAPT, than the ADAPT, than the family index fund, than the ETF. It didn't get much
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   closer. Sometimes it did almost exactly as well as the investment itself. The regular
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   fund had the same lack of casualties as the other funds. But it's hard to calculate what's
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   going on in ETS, because that daily volume, which is the only way we have of measuring
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   how much money is coming in and going out, it's very hard to do. If you get a daily volume,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   if an ETF has, I don't want to say a million shares, we have no way of knowing whether
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   it's a million purchases or a million sales. If it's a million in volume, and somebody
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   may be coming up and picking up, they'll have to equalize someone else to be the market
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   there. And if it's a million sales, they've got to be taking it in and putting it out.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And if it's a million purchases, they've got to be investing it. If there's no difference
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   in the energy in the volume, so we're still struggling with that. But I'm sure - I'm not
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   showing you that chart, but I think that's the best we can do to illustrate this point.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   What happens is, like I said this morning, I think it was 270 out of 275 funds, or something
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   like those kind of numbers. And nothing more than that is collaboration.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Should the investors in this room be at all worried that their strong hands are being
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   disadvantaged by the weak hands of the ETF class of shares that they own?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Well, in general, I think the answer to that is no. Because those weak hands will give
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   you aberrations in the market. We saw this with particular clarity, maybe too much clarity
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   in the flash crash. But at the end of the day, or at the end of the week at least, you
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   were just as well ahead as if it was a flash crash for you if you held shares to that.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   You were just as well over as you were before the crash ever happened. It didn't matter.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   In the long run, those market imperfections don't matter. You can ignore this.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   As I've often said, from a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury, signify nothing.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I'm quoting Mr. Shakespeare on a slightly different subject.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   On the other hand, there is something that I worry a little bit about.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I actually have a piece of data that I decided not to use this morning, but I'll give it to you now.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   I start to think about what's going on in emerging markets.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Very popular, I think, two of the largest ten marketplaces, the black market I should say, are two of the five or six largest ETFs.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Maybe two of them, maybe three, eight largest ETFs.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   The data, we found that 33% of all emerging market holdings in mutual funds, 33% of their holdings were in ETFs.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   ETF investors are traders.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   That makes me worry.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Supposing something happens to a big emerging market.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Supposing something happens to China.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Supposing something happens to Brazil.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And the ETF people decide to get out.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   There could be a big gap because of the marketplace.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   In poisoning that market with 33%, that's pretty remarkable.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   To be held by self-identified traders, if you will.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   So the concerns being on the ETFs dominate in terms of holdings in any category.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Now still, in the long run, that should not matter.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   But if the ETFs, I'm sorry, the emerging market funds are held up by mutual fund demand,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   then when they go, you could make a permanent, permanent emerging market return.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   I don't think we could do that.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   That's one thing I worry about.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And I particularly think that we at Vanguard, I should say we at Vanguard,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   I should be very careful about getting into these speculative funds and maybe focus on trying to,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   for our ETFs, for example, on the managers that meet certain qualifications,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   the investment body that meets certain qualifications.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And I've written in one Vanguard piece the other day that apparently it is disqualified
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   to make more than 25 trades in any six-month period.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   25 trades in a six-month period?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I mean, really?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Maybe 25 trades in your life.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Maybe 25 trades in your wife and your life together.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And the likes of children and grandchildren.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   You can go on and on.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   But it troubles me and it's not good for investment.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   It's not good for people at all.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And as I mentioned this morning, a lot of our worst branded ETFs,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   the reverse this and that, two times up, two times down, three times up, three times down.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Multiply the effects of the market.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And that seemed to be losing market share.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And a lot of ETFs that are out of business.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I wonder about Wisdom Tree.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   They aren't doing very well.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And they're a publicly held company, so we know how much cash they've got left.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   It isn't much as accounting.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Didn't they have to raise a little bit?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   They did raise a little bit, yeah.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Josh Jaffa, a mutual fund company that deals only with advisers.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I like that idea.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   You know, I think that if I hear the term "new normal" one more time,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   I won't be responsible for my actions.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   But this concept that emerging markets are what it's at because that's what economic growth is,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I think most of you know how I feel about that,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   which is that there's a converse relationship between economic growth and stock returns.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The problem has to do with dilution.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And when people talk about returning emerging markets,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   and the bull market by definition, bubble market by definition,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   is a market where people only think about return, not risk.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Twice in the past 15 years,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   the leading index of emerging market stocks has lost about two-thirds of its value.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And you can bet that most of the people who are invested in EWO,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and I even wonder about the DFA Emerging Markets Value Fund,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   which has a spectacular record.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   It is also the LTIA's biggest fund.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It may not also have the same problem.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   One of the issues, I hope Steve Dunn doesn't get angry at me for this,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   but I think Steve demonstrated to me the proper response to the flash crash,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   which was when Jack was talking about it, he leaned over to me and said,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   "What was the flash crash?"
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   But that was the right response.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I'm not sure that I have that much to add to what you're saying,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   because we don't have time for questions.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Sure.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Let's hear some of the big quotes.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Let me ask you, how will you sauce up fragile predictions
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   about future returns in the next decade?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I think...
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Don't be scared to disagree, by the way.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I was trying to drown you out, but I'll figure it out.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   I think in terms of real returns,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   so I see real programs on a per capita, per share basis.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   If you look at the shillers data, around a percent and a half of your money,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   you've got 2% dividend yield, so that's 3.5%.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   When I look at bonds, and I wonder about real returns for bonds,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   I start to tremble,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   because I think the review shows the best case scenario.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   I think that 4% return for bonds with 2% inflation on top of that
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   with 2% historical return,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   I think that's the best case scenario.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I think that in the worst case scenario,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   we could see real inflation,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   not even forgetting about that fiscal analysis that we need.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   We've seen falls in the bond market in the past several decades
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   of 50% on one bond.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I worry about that risk.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   My default bond position is a very short treasury investment a year,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   which has an expected return of -1.5%.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   I think that's acceptable,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   because I don't think it's going to be -1.5% for very long.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I'm very afraid of taking the risk of a spectacularly long negative return
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   if you buy bonds of the duration.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Yes, you may wind up with a nominal 4% return if you hold a bond for 10 years,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   but if inflation is averaging 6% or 8% or 9% over that period of time,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   you're not going to be happy with that duration.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I think that's the role of maturity.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I don't see any other consequences that would fall too far outside of that.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Let me say a couple of things about real returns.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   First, the reason we use 2%, essentially,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   is that's what the spread between the inflation hedge 10-year bond
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and the regular 10-year bond is.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   The standard market is called 2% inflation.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   I'm very clear on the bill,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   and I think it's going to be higher than that.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   How much higher, I don't have a way of knowing.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Of course, there's always this possibility of some kind of a really bad economic situation
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   that might only be 1%.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Who really knows?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   In compression, we get negative CPIs for years, for four or five years.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So, don't take the 2% as a "fate."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   One reason I know I haven't spent a lot of time,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   I haven't spent a fair amount of time, but not a lot,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   on looking at real returns as compared to nominal returns,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   is that real returns take the same amount of all the bonds.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Returns on the 4% stocks and the bonds take the same amount of all both.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   3% bonds will return 3% less than the nominal returns.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Stocks will return 3% less than the nominal returns.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   So, you're not muddying the water too much by using nominal returns,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   except to say that once you get--
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I don't know if you think about this, but I think I wrote about this in
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   a little bit of nonsense investing.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And that is, when you start taking these numbers down in real terms,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   then expenses really have an impact.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   You can take 2.5% out of 7, and I think we were using 2% inflation that way.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   All of a sudden, let's just say a third of the return is consumed by inflation.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   You take that 5, and half of the return is consumed by cost.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   We used to have this inflation before.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   I mean, it cost half of it.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And, you know, if you think about half of the cost,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   you take 2% out of 7, and that gives you 5.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Take 2.5% out of 5, that's 2.5.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   That's 100% of the return you got.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   We can put that in a different way.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And it just becomes just overpowering.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I guess if I was smart or a marketing kind of person,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I would always use real.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Because the impact of the cost just is magnified and magnified
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   and magnified over and over again.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Obviously, the number of the denominator, I guess,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   much bigger than us is the second grade.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   The lower the denominator, the bigger the impact that will seem.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   And then taxes, again, you can do it with the charts.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Taxes are murdered.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   If you're named taxes, not on 7% return,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   but you might get a 7% return from the usual fund.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You get a 5, 4.5% return.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Taxes on that 4.5% are going to be at least 1%.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And that's one more big deduction.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   It changes the expenses from 2.5% to 3.5%.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   So it's probably a pretty good idea to spend more time on real returns
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   than on non-real returns.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   But I hate to scare people.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I know I do a whole marketing thing anyway, still.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   And we shouldn't scare people.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And just make them think through it, worry how much they'll have
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   when they actually do retire.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   It's always bothered me, using implied-- taking implied inflation
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   as the difference between over a given period,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   the difference between the 20-year-old, 30-year-old, and the 10-year-old.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And I've never really figured out why that bothered me.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   It's probably because I read a couple of articles,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   and one of which might not have been a desk asker,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   but now it's important to me.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And basically, this theory--
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I think it's correct--
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   is that there's an implied liquidity premium
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   in the TIPS yield.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So in other words, the TIPS yield, let's say,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   is 1.4% at the long end right now.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   But that's really higher than it should be,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   because it has to be higher because of the liquidity problems
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and the liquidity shocks that you can have,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   which we certainly saw during the crisis.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And during the crisis, long-term inflation was short in value,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   and the long-TIPS--
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I think the long-TIPS fell by something like 20% or 25%.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   So it's a liquidity premium.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   That number is higher than it should be,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   which means that it unresonates inflation
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   when it's tracking lower number than the higher number.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   If the lower number is bigger than it should be,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   then high inflation is really where it's falling to.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   This implies 2% inflation.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   I think that what we're looking at probably implies
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   at least 30% inflation.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   So I agree with you that 2% is probably an underestimate.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   What we also-- you might want to comment on this.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   How accurate is that inflation number?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   How accurate is the TIPS?
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   It depends on what you're paying for.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   If you're paying for computers
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   or you're buying long-distance service,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   that's a pretty good number.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   If you're buying health care, lots of luck.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   If you're buying health insurance, lots of luck.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   The-- I do have my new book.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I know I do, but I can remember the number, though.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   I commented that we made some substantial adjustments
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   to the CPI in, I think, 1982.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And we had made those adjustments.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   The CPI of that period was not 3% a year,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   but 8% a year, something like that.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   And so we're, again, the victim of numbers,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   which is what this book is all about.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   It's been a reliable-- say, oh, inflation at 20.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   You don't remember what you're spending your money on.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And it all depends on-- a lot of it depends on politics.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And I heard on the radio the other day
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   that Social Security is going to have no ECOA this year.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   If there's any inflation by any measure,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   well, that's probably long overdue.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   We just have to fix that system.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And ECOA is part of it.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And this is not the stuff I'm happy about.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It's my own personal inflation.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   But it is sort of new news.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   But that's also how my health care costs go.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Bill.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I got a question for not only Jack and Bill,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   but the gentleman who was a [INAUDIBLE]
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   savings plan.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   But he also wants to comment.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I have always felt that, in fact, when
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I was writing early on, back in December of 1999,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   when everyone was in love with the 401(k) plan,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I had a little bit of a problem that the 401(k) plan
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   was going to be at the bottom of the likes
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   of which this country has never seen.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And last year, Time magazine had a cover story
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   saying it's time to retire the 401(k) plan,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   retire the 401(k) plan.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I've always felt that it's ludicrous to think
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   that the average intelligent person can save enough money
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   and invest it wisely and then withdraw it
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   in an intelligent manner over a 60- to 70-year period.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   It's just asking too much.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   It's not that they aren't smart, intelligent people.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   But it's just a thought in the past.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   My question is, how close are we to a system
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   where it may be more like Chili's or something,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   where a person is kind of forced to say
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   that it's a combination of time contribution, combined
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   with a private defined benefit plan, where somebody saves
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   enough money, and then they put it into a single premium
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   inflation-adjusted annuity, where they're kind of forced
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   to do that so that they're focused not on how much
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   emerging markets they have, but how much they're saving
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   and how that equates to withdrawing
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   30, 40, 50 years down the road?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Let me tackle that one first.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   First of all, Bill, you probably couldn't have said it
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   better yourself.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I mean, I agree with everything you said.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Our 401(k) systems at the moment, the shift from defined benefit
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   to defined contribution is a social experiment
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   that has failed catastrophically.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   My basic concept is the less autonomy you give people,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   the better.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   The more choice you give them, the worse things
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   you want it to be for them.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   So sure, force them to do all those things.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   But why not put the money into an independently run
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   pension plan that is perfectly transparent,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   that doesn't even give them the option of amortizing it,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   and it is amortized?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Exactly.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I don't get along with that.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   I'm all for physical channels.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And I personally think that a lot of people
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   have signed up for the hard-to-get, most pension
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   credit, which is low-cost.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   So that's how they get people to say, OK,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I feel like it's every day that people
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   are coming to the bank.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Tell me how much I need to save.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   I'll do it.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And there's so many others.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   There's a gazillion other moving parts.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   And nobody got people thinking about, well,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   how much time are you putting into emerging markets
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   and this and that.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   It's like, that's the last thing you need to be worried about.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   The thing you need to be worried about
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   is what our grandfathers and grandmothers worried about.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And that's the only safe way to understand it.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And I think the ICAs will remove all the ideas, too, right?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   I don't think the ICA likes anything.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Let me say something about 401(k) and [INAUDIBLE]
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   And that is, think about what it is and how discouraging
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   it, therefore, is.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   One, you're going to borrow money from it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Two, when you change jobs-- and maybe when you don't
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   change jobs, you can just take all your money out
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   and do whatever you want.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Three, you don't have to make a contribution
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and go out for your company and cut back your contributions
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   or eliminate them whenever they want.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   And they do that.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   They do that to a significant extent.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Five, I guess, you really get no guidance,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   no significant guidance from the companies.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   I helped the companies a long time ago.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   When I first got into the 401(k),
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   I guess it would have been in the late '70s or early '80s
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   when they started.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   It seemed like a national market for them,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   where actually, they're not being much more complicated
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   than I thought.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   That never bothered me.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And it seemed like the ideal way.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   The index fund, low cost, old forever, right up our alley.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   And it turned out that people wanted the general fund,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   the most popular 401(k) choice.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And you give investors their choices.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   That's what they do.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   And now it's World Fund of America.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   And I guess index is maybe third, something like that.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   And the most popular one's not so bad.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   There's too much junk running around there.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   All those flaws, how can it possibly lead
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   to a comfortable retirement?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   First, the answer is, look, the data doesn't.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   The average accumulation in 401(k) is--
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I mean, I can't remember the exact number--
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   somewhere between $34,000 and $54,000
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   will have a great retirement.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Imagine your friendly neighborhood mutual fund
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   delivering 1% annual expenses out of these conditions.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   So if you've got $54,000, you've got $540 a year.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Right.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   You have to indulge them when you get a dent in your fender.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Think about that.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   And so the way to improve it is to eliminate the flaws.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   It's actually, believe it or not,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   not that far from what President Bush, who never returns
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   the idea of privatizing Social Security
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   into a new reform firm proposal.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But it's basically a personal retirement plan, privatized.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   So you have your own account.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You can't take away from it.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   You're not depending on somebody else
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   telling you what the cost of living is,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   how much the payout's going to be, and all that.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And you have your own plan, pension plan,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   or a property sharing plan, or a contribution plan,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   or a defined-value plan.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Without all the flaws.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   And then we have to make sure that--
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I like to leave it at the private enterprise.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Because I've often said we need some sort of a government board
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   to give you sealed approval or eligibility
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   to have your shares.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   You can tell me how to do it.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   I'm a mutual fund manager.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   I've got these shares to my plate.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And if you don't have a low cost, forget it.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And if you're going to have high turnover, forget it.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And if you've got a big sales book, forget it.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Those kind of things aren't acceptable.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   So you've got to keep them in a sort of disciplinary thing.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   But only because it is.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   And no one flaws consistently.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   What do we know about all these millions and millions,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   tens of millions, probably 50 million people,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   or whatever the number is, who have defined contribution plans?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And that is, if we leave them to their own devices,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   say we're getting a marked return, a less astonishing cost,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I mean, they can't hold you to the market, right?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Seems unlikely.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And they really can't hold you to the market,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   as we were saying earlier.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   It's very hard to fail.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And so it's an average return, a huge cost.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And so that's just quite unacceptable.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   So you have to have some, I think, agency of some kind.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Maybe it's a new consumer finance agency.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I don't know.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   But say, use the standards for getting in.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And then let people compete.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Have less service and less price.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   But without all the rigidities of free food,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   the exercise of free will.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   And that doesn't make you popular.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   But we all know what the facts are.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And that doesn't mean that you can go very well.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   No, there's only more choices you have.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And like I said, the more decisions you have,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   the more flexibility you have, the more likely it is you will end up
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   with not only an accurate plan.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   My favorite factoid for 401(k)s is similar to your observation,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   which is the last I saw sorority associates dating,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   you know, if you look at people pre-retirement in '60 to '64,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   the median -- excuse me, the average 401(k) balance was
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   about $70,000.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   But the median was about $25,000.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   The average cost, out-of-pocket cost for health care,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   for the average Medicare recipient from age 65 to demise,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   was $4 million.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Basically, I agree with Bill, too, but I would say something about --
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   and we may do a little interpretation,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   but I'm not going to certainly say you shouldn't worry about real returns.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   You shouldn't worry -- that's the only thing you should worry about.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   When you get right down, it's a question of whether you present them
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   integrally to the equation and inside,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   or where you get to, you know, figuring it out,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   or you show what the nominal returns are,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   what you're all accustomed to, and then take them out there.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   You both end up with real returns.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And so I haven't thought quite the same way as he did.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   But it's a very, very problematic kind of thing,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   to wake an investor up to the risk of having how much money they have
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   by the time they retire.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   It's just something that's not going to go away.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And in a way, the results are so discouraging.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   If you look at returns, that's one thing I don't like about money.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   I love simulations.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Well, there are many things I don't like about money.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   I love simulations.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   They may take returns out.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   But just to give you a chart,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   as if the market is some kind of actuarial table,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   it isn't an actuarial table.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And in terms of the correlation between inflation and stocks,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   I can say two things pretty much by vote.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   One, there is almost no correlation between inflation and stock prices.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Stock prices do whatever they want to.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And if you want to find a correlation,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   look it over every 25-year period,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   you might get a decent correlation.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   That's not really what correlation is about.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   The inflation number looks like this,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and the stock return number looks like this.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And if you measure that correlation like that,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   you probably get about 0.20 or something.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   There is, or at least was, I haven't done this carefully,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   but I'm going to do this again.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And the total dividends in the S&P 500,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   dividends, compared to inflation,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   had, for a long period of time,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   had a correlation.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   That is, they both moved up gradually,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   without a lot of aberrations,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and without a lot of downs.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I don't know if you noticed when I mentioned this morning
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   the big decline in dividends in 2008.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   But those lines look very much alike.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   It's a high correlation between corporate dividends,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   or was at least a high correlation,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   between corporate dividends, called S&P dividends,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   and the CPI.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   But virtually no correlation.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   You can just check that correlation,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   because you can get it back.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   And, you can see this.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Because, you know, we didn't get a 57% decline
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   in the cost of living when the market dropped 57%.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Nor did we get a 50% decline when the market dropped 50%
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   back in 1973, '74.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   It was in late '72, '74.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   So, I don't have any movement for correlation,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   but we really can't find it.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   We've talked about stock prices,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   which in the short term are so heavily driven
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   by promotion and speculative return.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   But in the long run, as I said this morning,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   it's a crystal clear,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   that stock returns are driven by the productivity,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   dividend, power, and earnings growth.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And I just have that.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   - There's just one other comment,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   which was, if you remember back in the early 1980s,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   the mid-1970s, people were turning their stocks
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   because they were only yielding 6%.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   But that was a 6% yield yield.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   So, it's just not having the tips.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   The yield is 6%, not always good,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   but say it as it comes out.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   - Actually, I just made my,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   you're talking about stocks with dividends.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Isn't it, I didn't think all stocks paid dividends.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   It's a beginner question here,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   but I know there's lots of stocks that don't pay dividends,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   so you're accounting for that somehow.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   - Well, most stocks don't pay dividends.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And when you take the S&P, the total stock market,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   you just take the aggregate dividends
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   paid by all the companies.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   And I would guess that probably 20% corporations do not.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Most of them are gonna be on NASDAQ, not listed.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Most of them are gonna have short histories,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   very long histories.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   And in the long run, you know,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   be very clear on this.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   The value of a stock is a discounted value
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   of its future cash flow.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   There's no way around that.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   And the only cash flow you get from the stock
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   is its dividend.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Years ago, a company came along,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   kind of a growth company in the market business,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   I'll say the name, you probably know it,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   you've never heard of it, but it's long gone.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   And they were on the cover of Time magazine,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   and they promised never to pay a dividend.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   We will never pay a dividend,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   this is considered a big selling point.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Because they had, you know, they wanted to open a new store,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   that's what they were going at.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And before they even had a chance to rethink,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   they were out of business, and the place was full.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Does anybody remember P.J. Forbett?
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   - Where is it now?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   I haven't seen him around in a while.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   It's bankrupt.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   So, dividends are an important sign
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   of management's ability to spend cash.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   And I would argue, and I've been used to those points,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   I think managers, corporate managers,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   are very bad users of cash flow.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   They merge, they start new businesses,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   they start new product lines,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and they seem to invariably fail.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   And sometimes, for, let's give you this little example,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   sometimes, because of the messed up nature of them,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   I don't want to use that word,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   of our financial selection investment system.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And one example that comes to mind
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   are the beleaguered MBIA, municipal bond insurance,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and financial, as I say, it's a bulkhead.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Financial security bonds and insurance bonds.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   And, of course, Wall Street wanted them to grow
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   10% a year.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   As a manager, you could grow 10% a year, or 110.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   So, there were no more municipal bonds to insure.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   They insured them all.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   So they were helping the growth of the mutual fund,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   of the municipal bond market.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   And that maybe has a one or two percent growth rate.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Not good enough.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   We'll have to find something else to insure.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   I've got an idea.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Let's insure collateralized debt obligations.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Right?
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   And so they did.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   And where are they now?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   I think they're technically bankrupt,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   except those municipal bonds are such a long tail.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And then there's now a lot of litigation going on.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   I don't want to get into this over my death,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   but you can say that if you wish.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   But they separated MBIA into two things.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   The CDO portfolio and the muni portfolio.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   And now they've got litigation from bondholders.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   They've got one portfolio, they've got a portfolio,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   they didn't want.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   They tarred out the bank portfolio,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   and they've got an interest in that.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   I'm not sure exactly how it worked.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   It's been a good part.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   So now I think mergers are done for the corporate ego.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Corporate building complex.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And I've got to be a builder.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I've got to do it.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Imagine a corporate executive who comes in
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   and the CEO comes in and says,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   "Good morning.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   "Everything looks pretty fine to me.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   "I don't think we need to do anything."
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   You know, probably 80% of the time,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   that's what he should say, but he can't.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   He's got to improve on his predecessor.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   He's got to prove himself to the board.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And that means doing something.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   And then you say,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   "Well, I'm not going to do anything."
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   And it works.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   They're saying, "What do we need you for?"
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   So it's just, "I'm not kidding, really, about this."
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   And then you start to play accounting games.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Make insurance, well, you know, all this.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And why do you count something at all?
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   And I've gotten into more trouble about all this stuff.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   I mean, they're not quite as bad as the rating,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   but that's a pretty low bar, isn't it?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   [laughter]
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   You rarely on the court use the cash.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   - I really don't.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I can't think of one law or promotion
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   that hasn't been used before now.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   It is the one for you.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And let's start from the first principles, all right?
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   The economy grows or productivity grows at 2%.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   That's one of the constants of capitalism
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   in the development of the economy.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Okay, 2% growth.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   China shouldn't, but we're going to do 5% or 6% or 7%
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   or 8% because you're catching up in technology.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   If you're at the leading edge,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   2% is as good as it gets in the first issue.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   We get another percent in this country for inflation.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   So, okay, we're at 3% when things are really,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   people will all know in the long term.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   That's not what you see when you want to share a stock.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   A stock's value is shared for more than 2%.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   So it's 2% more shares every year.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   So that per share that you give
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   only grows at a percent or a percent and a half.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Now, what CEO, chairman of the board,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   is going to go before his shareholders and say,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   "I'm going to grow our earnings on a per share basis
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   of a percent and a half every year.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Don't you just love me?"
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   All right, well, he's got to grow 10%, 15%.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And to get 10%, 15% early,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   you start really doing the wrong things and losing it.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   The best example that I can think of--
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   I mean, there's all sorts of data in finance literature
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   you don't want to know about--
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   that basically says that corporations
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   have to fund their projects externally.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   In other words, that's the bottom of the bank,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   the bond-holding public, bond-buying public,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   that they tend to do pretty well.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   But when they take the capital internally,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   it's not subject to the discipline of the bank.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   They take it from their cash flow or their cash pad.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   But these projects do very, very poorly
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   because they're not subject to the same discipline.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Finally, the best example that I can think of
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   is we now have a 30-year, a 40-year track record, almost,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   on real estate investment trusts.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   On real estate investment trusts.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And the return on rates over the past 40 years,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   if I've got my facts straight,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   are about a percent or a percent and a half higher
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   than the overall market.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Why?
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Because rates have to distribute out 90% of their earnings
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   to the public, to the shareholders.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   All right?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And then the shareholders get to decide
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   how to deploy that capital and not the company.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   And that's why they do better.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   - Let me add to that.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I've seen this happen.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   I was a director of a very large paper company now gone.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   And it was fun.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   It was a Fortune 500 company.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   It was a Fortune 200 company, actually.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   And so I saw this happening.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   And when I finally concluded,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   after a long period of experience in New York,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   and it took me a long time to learn what it was all about
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   and learn how to behave as a corporate director,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   it was not really my style.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   But it was a fun learning experience
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   that I kind of got a hold of things.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   One, investment factors.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Wall Street is always wanting to do a deal.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   This will not surprise anyone.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   So they come to the head of the company and say,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   "Well, I've got a company for you."
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   And they give you all this paper, right?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   All this paper.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   And so you look at all the numbers for the deal,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   and they don't look very good.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   So the problem, one, is there are wheelers and dealers
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   that are willing by getting companies
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   to take over other companies' investment value.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   And then there's waiting companies to do something
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   not because it will increase their growth,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   but because when they put the two companies together,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   they will get synergies.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   So it might be hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   for synergies, without which the numbers won't work.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   And you say, "This will be non-pollutive,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   maybe even accretive."
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Then the world believes you
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   if you bring out all these numbers.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   But the accretion is because of these synergies,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   you get hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   And then the deal is done,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   and we wait for the synergies to come in.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And they don't announce themselves.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Like Santa Claus on Christmas Eve
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   coming in with a sleigh and 820 reindeer.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   You know, it's a kind of day-by-day thing,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   and other things happen.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   And the synergies, as far as I can see,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   never happen in any way like the way they were projected to happen.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   So those two things could be odds on any kind of merger.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   They could make the odds very long before.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   As I said this morning, 62%, 65% of these kind of acquisitions
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   and accommodations fail.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   That's all in terms.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   It's also advising people to do something.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Because there are limits, as Bill says,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   limits on what you can earn on capitalism, competitive markets.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   This is capitalism.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   That's a harsh, unforgiving market.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   And corporations, shoemakers will stick to their legs.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   It used to be said, back in the days when there were shoemakers,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   in Italy, I guess,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   that these corporations think they can do all things for all people.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I just don't think you can do that.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   I think it's one of the great mysteries of investing in capitalism
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   is why sophisticated, long-term investors can realize that.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Although, what's it going to do for the economy?
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   What are the companies that are going to grow?
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Smart people just buy a company that sticks to its name
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   and gives you a less competitive path to help you get it done,
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   and you get it decided to help you get it done.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   You know, one thing I think you've omitted
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   of involving internal development in the economy
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   is that it's a lot easier to buy a company,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   to emerge, and then come close.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   And they tend to get down the sheet
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   and there's various kinds of fooling methods,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   but it's a good thing I've been around for a long time.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   On the other hand, if you're not sticking to your name
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   but trying to diversify,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   it's hard to start a business.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   You need to create new areas.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   And that's why, I think, it's easy.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   It's a good thing to also have a point of capital.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Hi, I just want to read a line from one of these companies.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   By the way, Peter Lynch calls this thing "diversification."
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Do you remember Peter Lynch's book?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   It's a company that's very good at one thing,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   but not very good at another thing,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   and they do worse at mine.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   And the last company, in my opinion, to do this is Google.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   I don't know how many of you caught the story
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   that Google is getting into power transmission business.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   They are teaming up with a company
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   called Atlantic Link Connection,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   and they're spending roughly $5 billion
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   to create the Eastern Bergen Gulf and the East Coast
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   because they decided that they wanted to be good to the--
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   not good to the economy, but good to the environment.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   And so they've got a company that,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   if they got all this cash on hand,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   in my opinion, they should be paying it out
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   in the form of a dividend,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   but they're not ready to do that yet,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   so they're diversifying now.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   This is just the end.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   They're also in another business.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   You may have read something about it in the last few days,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   and that is they have a car
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   that drives perfectly well without a driver.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   And where that leaves all of us, I'm not sure.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   But it's parading around out there.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   They have somebody sitting in it just in case.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   But Atlantic Link--
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   - They're also coming up with their own inflation index, too.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   - Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   - Well, I think it's time to wrap up.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   That's got to go.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   And we want to get to the book signs,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   the next book sign before it does.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   So I thank you all,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   and we'll turn the book on.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   [applause]
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   - Thank you again for all the attention you've given me today.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   I don't think it's perfect, but we'll get it done.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   We won't go without your dad for another hour and a half,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   that's fine.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   It's not as good a book.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   But let me say a couple things.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   We've got my new book out there,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   just 10 copies of the first 150 copies or so that we have.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   And as Mel said, I can only do a signature.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   There's just too many people that are going to message to everybody.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   But I only want a signature.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   I'm going to have to wait it out and do that.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   And then, if we have a limited number of copies,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   we're going to ask you people who have copies here,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   if only you'd take one for the family.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   So I feel bad for you about that.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   You might have to teach how to do that.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   It's your own book.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   But the copy will be $18.95.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   It's the last of us.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   And if you get one for free,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   that's only going to judge the prices.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   It's $9.50.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   [laughter]
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   So thank you again.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   I'm sorry I can't do with you.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   [inaudible]
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   So thanks, and let's go sign the book.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   [laughter]
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   [silence]
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
