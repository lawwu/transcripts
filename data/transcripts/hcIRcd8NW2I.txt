[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6, and reading the first four verses.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Honor thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with promise,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Now we are dealing particularly this morning with the fourth verse.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We began looking at this verse last Sunday morning,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   and I was emphasizing that here we see another perfect example of the balance of the Scripture
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   and the supreme fairness of the Scripture.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   The Scripture is never one-sided.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So many have thought that it's always against the children,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and that it's a repressive, tyrannical system.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So many adolescents think that.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And of course, it is probably because their parents haven't paid sufficient attention to this fourth verse.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   But the Scripture is never one-sided.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And while it reminds the children of their duty of giving obedience to their parents
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and honoring their parents, it also has something to say to the parents.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   For the parents sometimes make it almost impossible for the children
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   to carry out the commandments of God.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So the Scriptures go on and say, "And ye parents, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath."
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And we were dealing with that last Sunday morning.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   In other words, the exaltation of the apostle to the parents has got two sides to it.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   There's the negative.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   We considered what we mustn't do.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We mustn't do anything to exasperate our children.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   We mustn't irritate them.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   We mustn't provoke them.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   No, no, that's the negative.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Well, what are we to do?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Well, here he puts it positively to us.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   "Bring them up," he says, "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And it is to that that I'm calling your attention this morning,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   this positive side of the apostle's injunction to the parents.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Now, the very way in which he puts it is interesting.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   "Bring them up," he says.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And that's another way of saying, "re-are them."
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Nourish them to maturity.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   In other words, the first thing that parents have got to do is to realize their responsibility for the children.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   As I was saying last Sunday morning, they're not our property.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   They don't belong to us.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   They're given to us by God for a while.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   What for?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Well, not that we may get what we want out of them and use them simply to please ourselves or to gratify our own desires.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   No, no, this is the task.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   They've got to be reared, brought up, nurtured, prepared, not only for life but especially the preparation of the soul for its relationship to God.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Life, of course, we see from injunctions such as this, is a tremendous thing.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And there is nothing that is so sad and tragic about the world today as the failure of the masses of the people to realize the greatness of life.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   What a tremendous thing it is to live as an individual, still more so when you come thus to the realm of the home and the family.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   What a great conception this gives us of parenthood, the business of parenthood, its function.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And here the apostle tells us that we should always be viewing it in this way,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   that here we are given these children that we may bring them up, we may rear them, we may train them.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You notice you read in the papers constantly about the care and the attention which people give to rearing various types of animals.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's not an easy thing to train a winner, whether it's a horse or a dog or whatever it is.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It's a thing to which you have to give much time and attention.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You have to consider the diet, you have to consider the exercise, you have to consider the bedding, you have to protect this animal from various hazards.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And you see it's quite a big business and people pay large sums of money, they spend a great deal of time and of thought in just bringing up, rearing an animal,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   that it may become a prize winner or a notable illustration.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   One is sometimes almost given the impression that very little such time and care and attention and thought is given to the rearing of children.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   That's the reason why the world is as it is this morning and why we are confronted by some of these acute problems in a social sense in this country at this present time.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   If only people gave as much thought to the rearing of their children as they do to the rearing of animals and of flowers, things would be very different.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   They read books about these other matters, they want to know exactly how it's done, they listen to talks about it.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   How much time is given, I say, to the consideration of this great question of rearing children, taken for granted, done anyhow somehow.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And the consequences are, I say, what are too painfully obvious to everybody at this present time.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   "Well now," then he says, "you parents, this is what you've got to do. Sit back for a moment, sit down and consider what you're doing.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   When the child comes, say to yourself now then, 'I'm the guardian and the custodian of this soul.' What a dread responsibility."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Many, you see, in business and in professions are well aware of the great responsibility upon them in their professions, the decisions they have to take.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And it is perfectly true, of course. But all I'm asking is this, are they aware of infinitely more with respect to their own children?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Do they give the same amount of thought and attention and time to it?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Does that weigh as heavily upon them as the right responsibilities which they feel in these other realms?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   The apostle says that we must regard this as the greatest business in life, the greatest matter which we ever have to handle and to transact.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Bring them up, rear them, nurture them.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Then we take this next word of his, "Bring them up," he says, "in the nurture and admonition."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Two words he uses, and they're very interesting words.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   The difference between them is just this, that the first one, the nurture, is more general than the second.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   It means the whole process in general of the cultivation of the mind and of morals.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's the totality of nurturing, rearing, bringing up the child.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It includes, therefore, general discipline.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And as the authorities all are agreed in pointing out, its emphasis is upon acts.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   The second word, the admonition, has reference more to words which are spoken.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But this is a more general term, this nurture.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And especially in acts, everything that we do for the children is included under this word nurture.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   There it is then, this whole process in general of the cultivation of the mind and the spirit and the morals and the moral behavior,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   the whole personality of this child.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Now that's our task, that's the business, is to look upon this, to care for it, to guard it.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   You remember we've had this same term as we were dealing with the relationship of husbands and wives,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   where we were told that the Lord himself nourisheth and cherisheth the church.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   No man ever yet hath his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Now that is the same sort of thing that we are told to do here with respect to children.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   General discipline.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And then you come to admonition.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   That, I say, is the same thing, only that it has its emphasis upon words.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Because there are these two sides, are there not, to this matter?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   General conduct and behavior, things we have to do in action.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But then in particular, in addition to that, there are certain admonitions that should be addressed to the child.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Words of exhortation, words of encouragement, words of reproof, words of blame.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Admonition includes all those.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Everything that we say to the children, in actual words, where we are defining positions and indicating what is right or wrong,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   encouraging, exhorting, and so on, that is the meaning of the word admonition.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So they are to be reared in the nurture and the admonition, and then of course the most important thing of all,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   of the Lord, the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And this is where Christian parents and their duty towards their children are to be found in an entirely different category from everybody else.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   In other words, this remark addressed to Christian parents is not simply to exhort them to bring up their children
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   in terms of general morality or good manners or general behavior.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   That, of course, is included.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Everybody should be doing that.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Non-Christian parents should be doing that.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   They are not doing it as we have seen, but they should.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   They should be concerned about good manners, good general behavior, an avoidance of evil.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   They should teach their children to be honest, dutiful, respectful, all these various things.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   That's common morality.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Christianity hasn't started at that point.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Even pagan writers concerned about good society have always exhorted people to do that.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   You can't run any society without a modicum of discipline and of law and of order, at any level or at any age.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   But that isn't the thing which the Apostle is talking about.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   He says that they are to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Now, here is the peculiar and the specific Christian thing.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   In other words, the object and the goal, which should always be in the forefront of the minds of Christian parents,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   should be that the children should be brought up in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ as Savior and as Lord.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   That is the peculiar task to which Christian parents alone are called.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   But this is their supreme task.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Our greatest desire and ambition for our children
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   should be that they should come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and as their Lord.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I'm sure we're all examining ourselves as we are proceeding.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Is that our main ambition for our children?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Is that the thing that comes first?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   That they may come to know Him, whom to know is life eternal.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   That they may know Him as their Savior and that they may follow Him as their Lord
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Very well, there are our terms.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   But now we come to the practical question.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   How is this to be done?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   And here is a matter surely that needs to be dealt with at a time such as this.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   You will notice in the Bible itself that there is a great deal of emphasis laid upon this.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   You get it in the Old Testament.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I read that sixth chapter of Deuteronomy as an example and illustration.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Here is Moses at the end of his life.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Just before the children of Israel are going to enter into the Promised Land,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   he's reminding them of the law of God and he's telling them how they are to live
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   when they enter into that land.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And you notice that he's very careful to tell them
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   how they have to teach their children this law.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's not enough that they know it and observe it themselves.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   They must pass it on.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   The children must be taught it.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   It must be inculcated into the children.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   They must never forget this.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So he repeats it twice in that one chapter.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You'll find it again in chapter 11 of Deuteronomy.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And you'll find reference to it constantly here and there through the Old Testament.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And here you see it is in the New Testament in exactly the same way.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And it's in many places in the New Testament also.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And it's very interesting to observe in the long history of the Christian church
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   how this particular matter always comes back again and receives great prominence
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   at every period of revival and of reawakening.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   The Protestant Reformers were concerned about this.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And it came back again, instruction of children in these matters.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   It was given great prominence.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   The Puritans gave it still greater prominence.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And the leaders of the Evangelical awakening of 200 years ago,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   they did exactly the same thing.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And there were books that were written about this, sermons constantly preached about it.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   It was a matter that was given very great prominence always.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It is a fact, of course.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And it is a most notable fact, and one which we should be emphasizing and stressing today,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   that when people become Christian, it affects the whole of their lives.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It isn't just something personal.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   It affects the married relationship.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   You don't get the number of divorces amongst Christian people
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   that you do amongst non-Christian people.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   It affects the life of the family.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   It affects the children. It affects the home.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   It affects everything.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   You will find that the greatest periods in the history of this country,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   and the periods of every other country, have always been those periods
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   that have followed a religious awakening, a revival of religion.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   The moral turn of the whole of society has been raised,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   even those who haven't become Christian are influenced and affected by it.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   It's a very wonderful thing that, in other words,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   it's just another proof of what I've often been stressing,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   that there is no hope of dealing with the moral problems of society
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   except in terms of this gospel.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   You will never get righteousness without godliness.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   But the moment people become godly,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   they proceed to apply it all along the line,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   and you get righteousness in the nation in general.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   But, unfortunately, we've got to face the fact that,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   for some reason or another,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   this aspect of the matter has been sadly neglected in this present century.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   It's a part of the whole breakdown that we've been considering in life and morals,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   and the family, the home, and all these other respects.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And it's a part of this whole mad rush of life in which we are all living,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   and by which we are all influenced so much.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   For some reason or another, the family doesn't count as it used to.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   It isn't the center and the unit that it once was.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Family life, the whole notion of it, has somehow been falling off.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And what is unfortunate, most unfortunate, is that this, alas,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   is partly true of Christian people also.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   We as Christian people are less guilty of this than others,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   but I fear we've got to plead guilty if we are going to be honest.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   The old notion that you get in the Bible,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   and that you get at these great periods of Reformation,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   I say, of the family and what happens there,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   in this respect particularly, has somehow or another fallen away.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   And it no longer is being given the attention and the prominence that it was once.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Very well. It makes it all the more important for us to discover
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   the principles that really should govern us in this respect.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And here are the ones that I would deduce from this teaching,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   and the teaching of the Bible in general.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   First and foremost,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   this bringing up of children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   is something which is to be done in the home and by the parents.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   That's the emphasis.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   It's the emphasis in the Bible everywhere.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   It is not something, you know, that is to be handed over to the school,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   whatever kind of school it may be.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   It is the duty of parents.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It is their primary duty.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It is their most essential duty.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   It is their responsibility.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And they are not to hand over this responsibility to somebody else.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I'm emphasizing this, of course, because we all are well aware of the fact
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   that that is what has been done, especially in this present century.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   More and more have parents been transferring their responsibilities
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   and their duties to the schools.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I wonder whether we've ever considered this.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   There is no more important influence in the life of a child
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   than the influence of the home.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   The home is the unit of society,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   and children are born into a home and into a family.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   There is the circle.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   That is to be the chiefest influence upon their lives.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   There's no question about that.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   It is the biblical teaching everywhere.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And it is always in so-called civilizations
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   where notions concerning the home begin to deteriorate,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   that ultimately a society disintegrates.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So that I think it is the business of Christian people
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   to consider and reconsider very carefully the whole question of boarding schools.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   As to whether it is right to send your children away
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   from the peculiar special influences of the home to somewhere else,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   so that they spend half the year, or perhaps more or less, a little,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   out of the home and out of the influence of the home
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   in some kind of institutional life,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   deprived of all that is represented by the family influence.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Can that be reconciled with the biblical teaching?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Because this has become more or less the custom and the habit, hasn't it?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Now the teaching of the scripture is that the child's welfare,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   the child's soul, should always be the primary consideration.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   And all matters of prestige, not to use any other term,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   but all matters of ambition should be put severely on one side.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Anything that militates against the child's soul
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   and its knowledge of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ should be rejected.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   The first thing we have to consider about children is, I say,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   their soul and their relationship to God.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And however good your education may be,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   if it militates against that, it must be put on one side.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Nothing comes before this.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It is in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And it is, I say, the primary task and duty of the parents.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Now in the Old Testament, of course,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   it's quite clear that the father was a kind of priest in his household
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   and in his family.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   He represented God, God is Father.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Well, fatherhood represents that in a picture.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And he was the kind of priest in the family.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   He was responsible for not only the morals and the behavior,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   but for the instruction of his children.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   The Bible's emphasis everywhere is that this is the primary duty and task of parents.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And it still is.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   If we are Christian at all, we must realize that here this great emphasis
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   is placed upon these fundamental units ordained by God.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Marriage, family, home, you can't play fast and loose with these.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   It's not you saying everybody's doing this and this is a wonderful system.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   The question is, is it biblical, is it Christian?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Is it really ministering to the interests of the soul of the child?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   I make a prophecy that the recovery of spirituality and of morals in this country
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   may very well come along this line.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   The Christian people will again have to do the thinking.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Nobody else will.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   We'll have to be pioneers once more, as God's people have always had to be,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   and the others will then follow.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   It is important that we should be considering to what extent this system
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   of boarding children away from home is responsible for the breakdown of morals in this country.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   And I'm not thinking of particular sins only.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   I am considering the whole attitude of children towards their own home.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   A home should not be a place where somebody spends a holiday.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You should go away from home to have a holiday,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   but there are so many children to whom home is nothing but a place where they spend a holiday.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And their parents, instead of treating them as children, of course,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   are giving them special treatment because they're only home for a while.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And the whole notion of discipline and of bringing up the child in the nurture
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   and the admonition of the Lord goes by the bar.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   But you say there are many special circumstances.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   All right, if you can prove special circumstances, I agree.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   But if there are not special circumstances, this is the rule.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And there are very few special circumstances.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Very well, then, I say this is the primary task of the home and of the parents.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And what are they to do?
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Well, they're to supplement the teaching of the Church.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And they are to apply the teaching of the Church.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So little can be done in a sermon.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   It's got to be applied, it's got to be explained, it's got to be extended,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   it's got to be supplemented.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   That's where the parents come in.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And I say it has to be applied also.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And if this is always right and important, how much more today than ever before.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Christian parents, have you ever considered it like this?
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   You've got a greater task than you've ever had for this reason.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Consider what is being taught to children in the schools.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Evolution is being taught them as a fact.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   They're not being told it's a mere theory which hasn't been proved.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   They're given the impression that it is an absolute fact
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   and that all people of scientific knowledge and learning all believe it.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And they're regarded as odd if they don't.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   We've got to meet that situation.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Higher criticism of the Bible is being taught.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   There are school teachers, to my own knowledge,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   are using textbooks which were published 30 and 40 years ago.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   They don't even know the change that has taken place even amongst the higher critics.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Your children are being taught such things.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   They hear them on the wireless, they see them on the television.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Anti-God, anti-Bible, anti-true Christianity, anti-miraculous.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Who is going to counter that? Who is going to deal with that?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Now that's the business of parents.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Bring them up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   It's a whole-time job almost at the present time.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   The forces against us are so great, so that you and I as Christian parents,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I say, have this unusually difficult task today of protecting our children
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   against these adverse forces that are coming to bear upon them with such power.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Well, there's your setting.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   But I'm anxious to be practical so that I can finish with this verse this morning.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   So I come to this. The next point I would make is this.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   It is first and foremost a parent's duty.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Secondly, how it is not to be done.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   There is a way of trying to do this which is quite disastrous
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and does much more harm than good.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   How is this not to be done?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Well, it's never to be done mechanically.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   It's never to be done in a mechanical, abstract manner,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   almost by numbers as if it were some sort of a drill.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   There have been many Christian parents who have done that.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   I remember having an experience once some ten years or so ago.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I went to stay with some friends of mine.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   I was preaching in the area and I always stay with them.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   And I found the wife, the mother in that family, in a state of acute distress.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   She and her husband and myself were talking
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and I discovered the cause of her distress.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   It was this. A certain lady had been there lecturing that very week
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   and she was giving her address, which she took right round the country,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   on how to bring up all the children in your family as good Christians.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Marvellous, wonderful. She'd got five or six children, this lecturer had,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   and she'd so organised her home and her life,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   she'd finished all the domestic part of the work by nine o'clock,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I think it was, in the morning, and then she proceeded to tell them how
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   she'd brought up all her children, every one of them was a fine Christian,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   it was so easy, so wonderful, and here was this poor mother
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   with two children in a state of acute distress,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   feeling that she was a complete and an absolute failure.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   What had I got to say to her?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Well, what I had to say was obvious. It was just this.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I said, "Wait a bit, wait a bit. How old are these children of this lady?"
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I happened to know myself and she knew also.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Not one of them, I think, at that time was above the age of sixteen or something like that.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I said, "Wait a bit. This lady tells you they're all Christians,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   she's brought them up like this, it's so easy, so wonderful,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   all you need is a scheme and then you carry out your scheme and it can be done."
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   "Wait a bit," I said, "the story may be different in a few years
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   and alas, God knows it is different."
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I wouldn't like to say that any one of those children is a Christian.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Some of them I know are openly anti-Christian and have turned their backs upon it all.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   You can't bring up children like that by numbers, it's not mechanical.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And in any case, it was cold.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I heard of the same lady in another part of the country.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   She'd been giving her same lecture there,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   but there there was somebody who had a little understanding and insight.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   One lady listening to the address made a very good comment, I thought.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   She turned to some friends on the way out and said,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   "I thank God she wasn't my mother."
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Yes, well, all right, there is something laughable about it,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   but there's something tragic about it.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   What she meant was this, you see.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   There was no love there, there was no warmth there.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Here was a woman who was proud of herself, she does it all by numbers, mechanically.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   What a wonderful mother she is.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   This other woman detected that there was no love there,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   there was no real understanding,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   there was nothing to warm the heart of a child.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   A child's not a machine, you can't do this mechanically.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Secondly, I say, it must never be done in an entirely negative or repressive manner.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   If you give children the impression that to be religious is to be miserable
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and always to be prohibiting this or that, and just repressing them,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   you'll drive them into the arms of the devil, you'll send them into the world.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   It must never be entirely negative and repressive.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I mustn't stop with these things, it has been so often.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   I meet tragedies all over the place.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   People come and talk to me at the end of a service and they say,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   "You know, I haven't been in a chapel for twenty years or so."
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And I say, "Why not?" and then they tell me.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   They've reacted against the harshness and the repressive character
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   of the religion under which they were brought up.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   They had no conception of Christianity at all.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   It wasn't Christianity.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   It was a man-made, harsh religion.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   I was talking about this in passing Friday night.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   It was a false Puritanism.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   There are certain people, you know, who only take out the worst out of the Puritans
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   and never have understood the best.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   They've seen the negative but have never seen the positive.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   It does great harm.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Thirdly, we must never bring up our children in the nurture and admonition in the Lord
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   in such a way as to make little prigs and hypocrites of them.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And I've seen a great deal of that in my time.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   There is nothing that I know of that is so sad and at the same time so revolting
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   as to hear children using pious phrases which they don't understand.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   But their parents are proud of them.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   They sort of say, "Listen to them. Isn't it wonderful?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Little prigs and hypocrites.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Too young to understand.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   They can't know at that age."
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   I know that there are many children who like to pray, play at preaching and things like that.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   That's all right. That's children.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   But when you get the parents thinking it's wonderful and putting up the children to do it
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   before the admiring gaze of adults, I say it's almost blasphemy.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And it is disastrous for the child.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   That's to turn our children into little prigs, to make little hypocrites of them.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And then my last negative at this point is this.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   We must never force a child to a decision.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Oh, the trouble and the havoc that has been wrought by this.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Isn't it marvelous that the children, my little child, aged five, decided for Christ?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Or some older age.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Pressure being brought to bear.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   It should never be done.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   You are violating the personality.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And apart from that, of course, you are displaying a profound ignorance of the way of salvation.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   You can make a little child decide anything, of course.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   We've got the power and the ability to do so, but it's wrong.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   It's not un-Christian.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   It's not spiritual.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   In other words, we must never be too direct in this matter.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Never be too direct, especially with a child.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Never be too emotional.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   If you, a child, feel uncomfortable as you're talking to it about these things,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   or if you're talking to somebody else's child, if the child feels uncomfortable,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   it's you who are wrong.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   The child should never be made to feel uncomfortable.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   You're too direct, or you're too emotional, or you're bringing pressure to bear.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   That's not the way to do it.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Again, I've known some real tragedies in this respect.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   I can think at this moment of two young men in particular.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I remember them before they reached the age of 15 or 16.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Their parents were always holding them forward.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   One of them even used to write about their children.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And there they seemed to be most marvelous, outstanding Christians.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Both of them repudiate the Christian faith utterly and entirely by today.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   They have no use for it at all.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   And they've gone plunged into the life of the world.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   "Oh, Christian parents, you're handling a life, you're handling a personality,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   you're handling a soul. Don't you bring your pressure to bear here.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   You're never asked to do that.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Don't you force your children.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   I know the anxiety, it's very natural.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   But we are spiritual, we are filled with the Spirit, remember.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Never violate a personality.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Never bring any unfair pressure to bear upon a child.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   It must never be too direct.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It must never be too emotional.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   It must never be done so that the children may feel that they're disloyal to us
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   if they don't do it.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   That's unforgivable.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   These things must be kept clear."
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Well, what's the true way?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Well, let me give you some headings.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I suggest that this is the true way to do it.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   There used to be, at one time in people's houses,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I used to see a great deal of them as I went around preaching.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I don't see them so often now.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   There used to be little cards hanging on the wall with this phrase on it,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   "Christ is the head of this house."
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Well, I'm not an advocate of putting up the cards as such,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   but you know there was something in it.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You remember the instructions that were given to the children of Israel,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   "Write them on the doorposts."
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Why? Well, you know, we're such forgetful creatures.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Perhaps we've overdone this matter.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   We've gone too far, perhaps, to the other extreme.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   We need to be reminded, you know, the early Protestants,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   they used to paint the Ten Commandments on the wall of their churches.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   There was something in it.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   We're so ready to forget the Ten Commandments.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Well, now they'd put up the "Christ is the head of this house,"
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   whether you put up the card or not.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   That's the great thing,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   that the impression should always be given
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   that Christ is the head of this house, of this home.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   How do you do that?
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Well, you do it like this, you see.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   You do it by your general conduct and example.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   These things are obvious, aren't they?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I'm merely mentioning them.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   But the parents should be living in such a way
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   that the child should always have a feeling
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   that they themselves are under Christ.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Christ is the head.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   So there should be everything in the conduct and the behavior.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   I was indicating this last Sunday morning, so I don't stay with it.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   But above all, there should be an atmosphere of love.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "Be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   That's our controlling text in this, as in all these particular applications.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Well, the fruit of the Spirit is love.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And if there's a home filled with an atmosphere of the love produced by the Spirit,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   well, most of your problem is solved, you know.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   This is the thing that does the work,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   not your direct pressures and appeals,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   this atmosphere of love.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   What else?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Well, the general conversation.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   This is how we are to do it.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   At the table, wherever you are, general conversation.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   You listen to the news,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   and conversation begins about the news.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Affairs are being discussed.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   International affairs, politics, and all these things.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Now, this is how we bring up our children in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   We are to see to it that even such general conversation is always in Christian terms.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   We bring in the Christian point of view.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   They will find, they'll hear other people talking about the same things.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   They may be walking along the road and listening to two men arguing about the very things that they'd heard discussed at home.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   But they'll notice one big difference.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   The whole approach was different at home.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   It wasn't approached in the same way as these two non-Christian men are doing the thing.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   In other words, the Christian point of view must come in over the whole of life,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   whether you're discussing international affairs or local affairs or personal matters,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   whatever it is, always under this general heading of Christianity.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   It's the most vital thing.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   You see, it works like this.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   The children unconsciously become aware of the fact that there is a governing principle in the lives of their parents.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   They're thinking that everything else is different.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   The whole atmosphere is different.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   And they gradually and consciously become aware of this.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   There's such a thing as a Christian point of view.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And that's a great victory that once they get hold of that, the problem becomes much easier.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Then the next question is, of course, answering questions.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   There you get your opportunity.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Sometimes extremely difficult, I know, but we are given the opportunity, answering questions.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Now, I like the way that it was put there in that sixth chapter of Deuteronomy.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   You remember it there in that twentieth verse?
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   It's put like this, "And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   'What mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord our God hath commanded you?'
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Then thou shalt say unto thy son, 'We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand,' and so on."
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Now, there it is.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   In other words, a day will come when the children will ask a question.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   They'll say, "Why don't you do this?"
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   "The father and mother of my little friend, they do this, that, and the other."
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   "You don't do that. Why don't you do that?"
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "What a heaven-sent opportunity of bringing up your child in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   "Ah, yes, but if we are to take it, we must know the reason why, mustn't we?"
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   "If you can't give a reason for the hope that is in you,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   you can't bring up your children in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord."
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   "Why don't you do this? Why don't you do that?"
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   "My friend's father comes home drunk. You don't."
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   "They spend their evenings in public houses. You don't."
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   "They spend their nights in the clubs. They spend their nights dancing. You don't."
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   "Why? What's the difference?"
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   "You mustn't brush the child aside."
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   "Well, that's it. We're all different, you see, and this is how we prefer it."
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   "No, no," you say, "look here.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   We are all alike fundamentally,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   and we behave in this different way not because we're different people."
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   "It isn't that. It isn't that I've got one temperament and he's got another."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   "We're all born in sin. We're all slaves."
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   "There's something wrong within us all. There's an evil principle. We don't know God."
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   "And you see, the difference is this, that I've come to see that,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   to see how wrong certain things are."
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   "But I'd still be like that were it not that God sent his only son,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   this Jesus of whom you've heard, into the world to rescue us, to deliver us."
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   "And you give your gospel. You decide how much to give."
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   "It depends upon the age of the child or not, but answer his questions."
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   "Let him know. Let him know exactly when he asks his questions."
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   "You don't feist it on him. You don't preach at him."
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   "But if he asks his question, 'Why this?' Well, tell him. Tell him."
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   "Tell him very simply. And tell him more and more as he gets older."
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   "But be ready always to answer the questions."
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   "Know your facts. Understand your gospel."
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   "Build yourself up in it so that you can impart it and pass it on."
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   "And thus you'll be able to bring up your children in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord."
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   "And then you can guide their reading."
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   "Biographies. Biographies will appeal to them."
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   "Guide their reading in various ways to turn their minds in this right direction."
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   "What else? Well, be careful always, whenever you're going to have a meal, to return thanks to God for it."
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   "And to ask his blessing upon it."
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   "It's a great thing that's not done by anybody except those who are Christian these days."
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   "But if your children are just accustomed to hearing you thanking God,"
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "And returning thanks and asking a blessing, it'll do something for them."
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   "Go further. Have a family altar."
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   "What do you mean?"
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   "I mean this. That once a day, every day, as a family, you should meet together on the word of God."
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   "The father, I say, is the head of the house. Let him read a portion of scripture."
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   "And let him offer a simple prayer."
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   "It needn't be long, but let him acknowledge God."
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   "Let him thank God for the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   "Let the children hear the word of God."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   "If they ask questions, answer them. Give them instruction as you can."
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   "Be wise. Be judicious."
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   "Don't make it something hateful to them. Make it something that they look forward to."
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   "Something that they delight in."
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   "Do it in such a way."
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   "But have your family altar."
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   "In other words, for me to sum it all up and to close."
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   "The way to do this is to make Christianity attractive."
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   "We should give our children the impression that the most wonderful thing in the world is Christianity."
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   "And that there is nothing in life comparable to being a Christian."
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   "We should create within them the desire to be like us."
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   "They see us and they see the joy that we have in it all."
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   "And the way we glory in it all."
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   "And the way we marvel and wonder at it all."
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   "The thrill of it all."
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   "They should be saying to themselves, 'Oh, I'm longing to be as old as they are."
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   "So that I can get in it what they're getting and enjoy it as they enjoy it."
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   "That's a way to do it."
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   "Not mechanical, legal, repressive, forcing."
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   "No, no."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   "But in all we are and all we do and all we say."
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   "Just letting them know that we ourselves are the bond slaves of Jesus Christ."
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   "That God in his grace has opened our eyes and awakened us to the most glorious thing in the world."
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   "And that our greatest and deepest desire for them is that they may enter into the same knowledge and have the same joy."
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   "And have the highest privilege of all in this world of serving him and living to the praise of the glory of his grace."
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   "Whatever their work, whatever their vocation, whether it is business or profession or manual labor or preaching."
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   "Doesn't matter what it is. Do all things for the glory of God."
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   "Bring them up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord."
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Amen.
