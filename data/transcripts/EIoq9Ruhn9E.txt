[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   I thought that Brian showed in the book that actually people don't even remember many of
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.320]   the basic facts that they learned in school.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.320]   Of course they don't.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.080]   But that's not the main thing they learn.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.720]   They learn some vision of how the world works, how they fit into it, that they ought to have
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.800]   higher aspirations, that they can join the upper middle class, that they're supposed
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800]   to have a particular kind of job.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.160]   Here are the kinds of jerks you're going to meet along the way.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.480]   Here's some sense of how dating markets work.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.760]   Maybe you're in a fraternity.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.560]   Maybe you do a sport and so on.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.920]   That's what you learn.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.200]   How did you spot Brian?
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.960]   He was maybe in high school even when I met him, and I think he made a point of seeking
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.960]   me out.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.920]   I immediately thought, "Well, this guy's going to be something.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.920]   Got to keep track of this guy."
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   Say more.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.280]   What happened?
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.440]   His level of enthusiasm, ability to speak with respect to detail, and just bursting
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.080]   with everything was immediately evident, as it still is.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.000]   Brian has changed less than almost anyone else I know over what is now.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.600]   He could tell you how many years, but a whole bunch of decades.
