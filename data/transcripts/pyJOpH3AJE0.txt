[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200]   All right, we got a next question here from Daniel.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.800]   Daniel asks, when your schedule gets thrown off considerably,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.600]   such as losing a full day or two unexpectedly,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.000]   do you revise your weekly plan throughout the week?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820]   Yes.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.440]   Short answer, yes.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.400]   When your plan gets messed up, fix it.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.440]   Now, you're used to me saying this for daily time block planning.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.080]   That's baked into my time block planning philosophy,
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.320]   is that you're building a plan for the hours of your day in advance.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.680]   But it's just your best guess on what's gonna work.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.960]   And then when it gets knocked off, when you get knocked off that schedule,
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.240]   you adjust the plan for the time that remains next time you have a chance.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.480]   It's why if you use my time block planner,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.240]   you will see there's multiple columns for your time block plan.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.120]   Those columns are there for only one reason, updating your daily plan.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.400]   Do the same thing with your weekly plan.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.720]   Okay, it got knocked off.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.640]   There was an emergency.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.760]   All of Wednesday we had to deal with a client emergency.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.680]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.120]   That's part of your job, is like how do you deal with emergencies?
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.200]   You don't get gold stars for sticking to a plan.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.760]   You get gold stars for actually doing your work well.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.240]   So next time you get a chance, and it might not be until Thursday morning.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240]   Or maybe Thursday afternoon,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.480]   because you have a lot of meetings Thursday morning.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.120]   You sit down and say, okay, given the time I have less than a week,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.480]   how do I wanna update my weekly plan?
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.360]   And you know what, if we're gonna start moving up the ladder of timescales here,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.000]   do the same thing with your quarterly plan.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.800]   Those get knocked off all the time.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.040]   A giant project falls on your plate.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.080]   Oh, this is what I'm doing this fall now.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.000]   I had this more optional project I had planned to work on at the beginning
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.520]   of the fall.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.760]   I should probably update this quarterly plan to reflect
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.120]   this is the new thing I'm doing.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   I think that's fine.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.840]   Or you had a vision for a plan and it's not going well.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   Okay, update it.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.000]   This happened to me, I was working on a book proposal.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.080]   I've been talking about some of these books on the podcast,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   what I've been working on.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.320]   I was working on a book proposal over the summer.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.600]   I wanted to finish it in the summer before my schedule got busier for the fall.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.160]   And that was my plan for that particular quarter.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.920]   But as I got into it, I realized, you know,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.200]   I'm not ready yet to pull together these threads.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.680]   This is going to take more thinking and reading and grinding,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.560]   cognitive grinding that I'm going to have time to finish in the summer.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560]   So I updated that plan.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.520]   Okay, that's no longer what I'm trying to do by the end of the summer.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.000]   Going to do that by the end of the fall.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.280]   So at all scales, you make the best plan you can.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.120]   When you get knocked off, you fix it when you next have some
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   breathing room to do so.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.840]   Remember, the goal here is always intention.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   Do I have some intention with how I'm tackling the time that's coming up next?
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.840]   It is the tackling of time with intention as compared to tackling time
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.640]   haphazardly or reactively that creates all the big gains when it comes to work.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.600]   Not sticking to a plan, but always doing your best to have a plan for
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.320]   the time that remains.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.400]   That's where the big wins happen.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   So Daniel, don't worry about fixing your weekly plan.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.320]   Do it when you get a chance.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.000]   And you know what? If your schedule blows up on Friday,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.280]   then maybe you never get around to fixing it.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.800]   That's fine.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.160]   You're just doing your best to have intention.
