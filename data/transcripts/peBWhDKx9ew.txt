[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.520]   Welcome back Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.960]   This is the show where we take questions from you, the viewers.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.960]   If you have a question for us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.720]   I see everyone in the live stream today.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.720]   Thanks for coming.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.720]   If you have a question for us in the live stream, put it in there.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720]   We have someone monitoring now.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.080]   I know there were some questions last week.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.800]   We didn't get to them.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.720]   And this is how powerful I am.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.720]   Send us a question.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.520]   I will move it to the top of the list for the next couple of weeks, and we'll put it
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.520]   on there.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.520]   So let us know what you think.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.480]   Especially if you're from Michigan, it'll go right up to the top.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.360]   Yeah, I have a place in my heart for those flyover states.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.800]   Duncan, anything going on in the stock market lately?
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800]   Seems like it.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.880]   Seems like a lot's going on.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.880]   Let's do it.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.880]   We got some questions on the correction again.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.880]   They're coming in hot.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.880]   What do we got?
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.880]   Okay.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.000]   First up, we have a question from Benjamin, who writes, "Since Ben is a data junkie, does
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.160]   he have any data or opinions on when markets hit a bottom?
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.600]   Does the adage 'catching a falling knife' always hold true?"
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.800]   Guilty.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.120]   I am a data junkie.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.520]   I like looking at historical data.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.920]   I don't think I do it because it tells you what is going to happen in the future.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920]   It tells you what can happen, not what will happen.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.680]   It gives you this range.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.920]   I have some bad news for you.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.440]   You really can't call a bottom.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.200]   It's basically impossible.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.800]   The problem is that fundamentals don't matter very much, especially when this is happening.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.120]   Emotions grab the steering wheel.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.260]   That's why markets are always way more volatile on the way down than the way up.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.820]   You take this slow stare up and then an elevator down, they say.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.800]   It's because when people are losing money, they panic, and then they try to do more,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.840]   and they think if they try harder, they're going to figure it out.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.200]   It is funny, though, because there are all these sayings about market bottoms, right?
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.080]   Markets never bottom on a Friday, right?
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.800]   Which sounds really smart to say, because it's like people think about their losses
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.240]   over the weekend.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.560]   And then another one in the past has been markets never bottom on a huge up day, because
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.840]   the idea is when stocks get more volatile, you have these big up and down days on the
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.080]   same days, right?
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   Because people are going back and forth.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.960]   So March 2020, we saw up 8%, down 8%, up 9%, down 10% on a daily basis.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.440]   And so the best and worst days in history tend to cluster around these bad bear markets.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.720]   Unfortunately, in March 2020, the market bottomed on an up 9.4% day.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.760]   In three days, the market was up 18%, and it basically never looked back.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   And when it happened, everyone goes, "Okay, it's impossible.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   Markets don't bottom like this."
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.400]   So I think even if you find something that can work, like let's say you found this secret
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.640]   sauce, it probably wouldn't work forever.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.480]   So the only thing I've found is that we can segment corrections a little bit to figure
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.200]   out how long they're going to last.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.240]   So John, let's pull up this first chart.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   Let's do a chart on.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.360]   This is the S&P 500 since 1950, and I looked at corrections when they're in a recession
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.280]   or caused by a recession or non-recessionary.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.320]   And you can see non-recessionary corrections tend to last a little less time.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   They don't fall as much.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.640]   If you're in a recession, it's going to last a lot longer, closer to a year.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.580]   The average downturn is like 30%.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.000]   So we typically see those crashes during a recession.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.880]   If it's a non-recessionary one, it doesn't go down as much.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   It's more of a correction.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.240]   So let's take a look at the recessionary ones first.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.320]   So John, let's put this next chart up.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   I took the S&P since 1950.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.560]   I looked at these drawdowns during recession, and then I looked at what happened at the
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   bottom.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   So what's the CAPE ratio?
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   What's the P/E ratio using trailing 12-month earnings?
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.080]   What's the dividend yield?
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.400]   I wish I could find a pattern here.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   There really isn't much.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.720]   The only pattern really is in the 70s and 80s, valuations were much lower, yields were
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   much higher.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.820]   Now they've been much higher and yields lower.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.820]   You can see in 2009 that the P/E ratio was over 110 because earnings fell off so much.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.440]   So leaning on fundamentals during a market correction is not going to help you very much.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.460]   I wish there was a line in the sand, but there really isn't.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.760]   And actually during recessionary corrections, it's kind of rare when there isn't a bear
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   market.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   It usually happens more often than not.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.160]   It's almost always a bear.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.120]   So let's look at the ones outside of a recession, because I think that's probably more apt for
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.840]   today, unless people think the economy is really rolling over.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.320]   So again, there's more of these.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.240]   Again, the valuations and the P/E ratio and the dividend yields, there's no level you
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.400]   can find in the sand that's going to do something.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.600]   I do have some potentially good news.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.920]   Assuming this current downturn, the economy doesn't slow, we actually had GDP numbers
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.800]   come up this morning.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.140]   On a nominal basis, before inflation, the U.S. GDP grew like 11.7% in 2021.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.440]   After inflation, it was still talking like 4 or 5%, pretty good.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.600]   So let's say the recession doesn't happen and we're just a regular downturn.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.660]   John, show up to the last table here.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.320]   This is bear markets outside of a recession.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.080]   It basically doesn't happen.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.360]   So if you're worried about this correction turning into a crash, you never say never
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.160]   with the markets, but really 1966 and 1987, I put these other ones up there, they were
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.640]   19 and change.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.880]   I really don't know who decided, who's the grand wizard who said, "All right, 20% is
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.960]   a bear market.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.040]   That's it."
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.520]   I don't know who said that, but for some reason in the 1970s and the 1990s and two times now
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.860]   since 2008, we've had these 19% and change that don't get to a 20% bear market on a close.
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.000]   I don't know if you want to call those.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Duncan, what's the ruling here?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Are those bear markets or not?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.200]   If they're 19.8%, do you round up?
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.280]   I'd call that a bear market.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   Okay, close enough.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.180]   But it's pretty rare outside of a recession to see an all-out crash besides like a 1987.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.760]   So maybe that's a feather we can hang on our hat.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.040]   Obviously again, you never say never, but that's about the only thing I can think of
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.040]   now that, you know, obviously the other side of this, predicting recession is pretty hard
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.040]   too.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440]   The last one was easy.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.280]   Tom Hanks got COVID and NBA shut down and everyone was told to stay home for eight weeks.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.920]   So we all knew exactly when the recession started.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.760]   So that one's kind of tough, predicting recession too.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.000]   But I'd say like, there's an old saying that the only people who can nail a bottom are
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.960]   liars and people who are lucky.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   That's pretty much it.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.480]   It's hard to do because there's so many emotions going on.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.000]   And once stocks start falling, a lot of people will think, "Oh, they're only going to fall
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   further."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And other people are trying to catch a falling knife.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.680]   So unfortunately, I can't pick a bottom for you and there's no data that will tell you
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   that.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.240]   You look at price, but even that is an indicator that can work sometimes and not work other
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.240]   times.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.280]   It seems like the best strategy to calling a bottom is to just continually call for one.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   Yes.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   Just like calling a crash.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.080]   You call a crash every single year, eventually you're going to be right.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   It's got to happen.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080]   All right.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.080]   What's our next one here?
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   Okay.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.960]   So up next, we have kind of a long one, but I want to remind everyone, we also release
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.880]   this as a podcast on the Goldmine, and so I do need to read this for our listeners.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:42.200]   So this question is from Brett and he writes, "I'm 25 and make about $55,000 a year.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.500]   While you guys give tremendous investing advice, you also mention the importance of gaining
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.680]   life experiences that make you happy.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.240]   I'm planning to take a year to backpack through Europe to see friends and family.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.800]   I'll have about $27,000 saved and will probably come home with around 15.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.740]   The job I currently have is nothing in my field of interest and I only accepted the
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.120]   role during the uncertainty of COVID.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.840]   I've mentioned my plan to friends and while most are supportive, some are calling me crazy
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.200]   or saying this is money I could put towards a home or investing.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.880]   I have a few thousand saved between my Roth and 401k.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.440]   Am I crazy for doing this?"
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.920]   This is a good one.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   I like this.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   Yes.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.560]   This is very good.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.360]   What's the Ben Stiller gif from Starsky and Hutch?
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   Just do it.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   Right?
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   Do it.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.600]   And honestly, I wouldn't listen to your friends and family here.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   You're 25.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   You're young.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   You have no responsibilities.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.340]   It sounds like no house, no kids.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.140]   You will never get this opportunity again.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.100]   And I think the fact that you've already managed to save enough money and plan for this shows
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.240]   that as far as finances go and saving, you've already got those habits in place.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.200]   So yeah, you're going to spend this money and blow it potentially and it could be, if
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.560]   you compounded it over 40 years, what would it be like?
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.200]   But think about how those memories will compound.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.400]   You will create memories on this trip that will last a lifetime and you will never, ever
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.640]   regret it.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.800]   So I would say just completely do it.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.760]   Obviously, the job situation when you come back is something you have to think about.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.240]   I don't know if you're planning on working remotely or what you're doing for income in
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.800]   the meantime, if you're just going to live off your savings for a year.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.160]   But when you're in your 20s, do it.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.680]   You're never, ever going to have an opportunity to do this again, ever.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.560]   I'm not going to be one of these fire people that says, "No, you can't spend money.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.320]   You can't enjoy yourself.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   You've saved your money.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   You planned it out.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   You can always play catch up later."
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.680]   Again, you've already shown that you have those habits.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.120]   So the only thing I'd be worried about is taking a year off and finding a job when you
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.120]   come back.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.160]   But if there was ever time to do it, during a pandemic when people's lives are changing
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.260]   and it's a pretty decent job market, I say you're in your mid-20s, go have fun, stay
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.080]   in some youth hostels in Europe and enjoy yourself.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.960]   It's like Josh said a while back that traveling at 70 isn't more fun than traveling in your
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960]   20s or 30s.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   No.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.400]   I mean, when you're in your 20s, like when I was in college, we stayed in a bunch of
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.720]   youth hostels and it was so much fun because you're around all these other young people
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.480]   and you're at the campfire and it's kind of dirty.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.160]   But I look back at it now and I go, "I would never stay in that now.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   What?
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   Are you kidding me?"
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   But back then, you don't care, right?
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.480]   And you just wing it and you have these plans and you never know where you're going.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.600]   I say the memories you'll get from this will compound even more than your money.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.400]   I'd say just don't listen to your friends and family.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.560]   Have fun.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   Enjoy yourself.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.120]   But make sure that you can hopefully have a decent income back and use this as an experience
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.200]   as a jumping off point for finding something that'll help you when you come back for your
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   job too, I think.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   That's good advice.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   All right.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   Let's do another one.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   Okay.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   Up next, we have a question from Ulf.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.160]   He writes, "I'm nearing retirement and have stocks with substantial gains in both my IRA
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.400]   and non-IRA accounts."
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.520]   I'm not exactly sure what he means by non-IRA, but you can discuss that, I guess.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.640]   "I need to use some of this for my retirement, but I also want to leave as much as possible
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.480]   to my children when I die.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.400]   Which funds should I use up first, the IRA and pay income tax, but no capital gains,
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.180]   or the non-IRA with capital gains tax, but no income tax?"
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.960]   So he's talking here like he has a brokerage account, probably just a taxable brokerage.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.280]   So basically, I have this taxable money and this tax-deferred money.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   What do I do?
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.280]   We get a lot of questions like this, actually.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.280]   Like, "I'm retiring.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.920]   Where do I take it from to make sure that I minimize my tax bill?"
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.480]   So obviously, we're going to bring in our tax expert here, the one and only Bill Sweet
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   to help with this one.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.280]   General, good to be back with you.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   Bill lives and breathes this stuff 24/7.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.340]   I do.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.400]   So Bill, obviously, this kind of thing is circumstantial depending on your income levels
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.760]   and what the gains are.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   But I think this is a good starting point for a lot of people who are near retirement
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.640]   and wondering, "Well, what do I do just to minimize the pain here?
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.000]   Because I'm going to have to pay taxes somewhere."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So what's the rule of thumb on this stuff?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So first off, shout-outs to Ulf.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.240]   I think it's really awesome to think about that next generation.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.260]   But what we're talking about here, Ben, is the key difference between how assets are
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.200]   taxed both while the primary calendar is alive and then post-mortem, right?
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.760]   Because this is grim stuff, but Ulf asked the question.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.840]   I think it's noble for him to think about.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.120]   So while you're living, any IRA distributions that come from a bucket that involves an IRA,
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.480]   401(k), 403(b), anything that's a tax-qualified account that's pre-taxed, you get taxed at
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.680]   ordinary income.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.920]   And so you're going to pay somewhere between 10 percent all the way up to 37 percent, Ben,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   to your point, about where their income lies in the tax range.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.880]   And so that's criteria one for that tax-qualified asset.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.640]   Bucket two would be non-qualified assets.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.240]   And Duncan, like you point out, it's probably assets held in a brokerage account, so your
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.560]   normal taxable non-qualified assets.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:36.440]   After you die, what happens is that basically the IRA continues to get taxed at the heirs
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   tax rate.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.200]   And so post-2019, there's this 10-year clock that starts, and basically your beneficiaries
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.560]   have to take a distribution, and they have to pay the tax on that IRA within 10 years
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.560]   of your death.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.800]   So that's something to consider.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.400]   The point that I'm trying to make, though, is that somebody's going to pay tax on that
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.900]   IRA, either you are or your heirs are.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.720]   And so I think there's a little bit of calculus on what the tax rate is.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.860]   When we switch over to the non-qualified assets, what happens is, on death, you get a step
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.520]   up in basis, or potentially a step down.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.400]   And so if Ulf is lucky, he's had a good couple of years in the stock market, let's say, and
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.120]   he has a 50% gain, that gain gets erased on his death.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.760]   That means the cost basis for his heirs are going to be whatever the value is at that
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.760]   time, right?
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   Correct.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.720]   And so if his heirs decide they want to sell their assets right after they inherit it,
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.320]   in theory, they're not going to pay any income tax, which is a very cool feature.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.120]   So IRAs, somebody pays the tax.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.920]   Capital gains, if you pass it on after death, and again, it requires you to die, unfortunately,
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.860]   to get that step up, nobody pays the tax.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.260]   So that's probably the key consideration.
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.640]   The answer is probably a little bit of both, right?
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.600]   Because any gains for a single individual, assuming you have no other income under $55,000,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.000]   your capital gains rate is zero, versus probably about 10%, 12% for your IRA.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.660]   So it's a bit of a calculation every year, but I think in general, I would seek to pass
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.800]   on the asset that would get that step up in basis, and that means the non-qualified assets
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   would get spent last.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.960]   I want to help out Ulf's children here, too.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.240]   How are we able to get his kids some money now so they can enjoy it while he's here?
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.040]   So what is the tax gift situation, like how much can you give to your kids without paying
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   taxes on it?
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   What's that deal?
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   So I want him to give some of his kids some money now, too, not just when he dies.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.280]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.380]   And there's two taxes we have to worry about here, because what we've been focusing on
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.440]   before is income tax, but there also is a gift and estate tax.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.480]   But there is an exclusion each year, and I think, Ben, that's what you're getting at,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.340]   of $16,000 per person to person.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.000]   And so if you're gifting to, a married couple can split a gift and you multiply that times
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.360]   2, that's $32,000, and that is gift tax-free.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.880]   However, the basis continues on with the taxable gift.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.400]   And so again, back to that step-up in basis thing, that's an important consideration to
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.520]   keep in mind.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:49.040]   If you pass on low-basis Apple shares that you bought at $0.20 20 years ago, your heirs
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.280]   are going to pay all the capital gains tax in gift, whereas if they get it through your
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.720]   estate, they get the step-up.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.360]   So a bit of pros and cons on each.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.200]   Generally, you see gifting done in cash, unless there's another consideration otherwise.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   That works for me.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   All right.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   Duncan, last question.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   Okay.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.400]   So this last question is, "I see what's going on right now in the markets, and it's making
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   me really nervous.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.880]   It seems to me that this could get a lot worse.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.560]   Should we go to cash?"
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.880]   All right.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.880]   Hand up here.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.880]   I'm going to admit something.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   This is a plant.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.920]   We're going to try something different with this last question.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.240]   I think we at Ritholtz do a really good job of putting out content and trying to put things
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.920]   into context and set expectations ahead of time with our clients.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.800]   But there's always a big difference between a blog post and a video and the feelings you
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.560]   get from seeing the money you've created in your life savings evaporate before your eyes.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.200]   So there's this great quote from Mir Statman, who's got a bunch of good books on this.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.280]   He's a psychologist, and he's like, "Financial advisors frame themselves as investment managers,
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.440]   providers of beat-the-market pills, when in truth, they're mostly managers of investors."
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440]   Right?
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:54.000]   And obviously, most people, most clients, are completely fine when something like this
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   happens.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   They've done it by themselves.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   They've done it with an advisor.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.800]   They don't really sweat this stuff.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.280]   But Bill, you've been doing this a long time.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.360]   You've had a lot of conversations before.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.520]   What are some of the biggest problems when helping clients through this?
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.760]   Because that's a different situation.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.680]   You know your own personal risk tolerance, but every client has their own differences,
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.880]   and sometimes what you say may not be what you feel and how you act.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.320]   So what is your experience dealing with clients like this, and what are some of the things
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.480]   that they come to you with?
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.880]   I think the key, Ben, in situations like this for advisors, if you're trying to help somebody
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.200]   cope with something like this, is do your best to take the emotion out of it.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.160]   Recognize that it is painful to watch your assets decline.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.040]   And Ben, one of the things you and I talked in the show prep was, the larger your balance
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.720]   gets, the larger your portfolio gets, the more pain is involved.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.200]   When you see your $1 million account balance decline 10%, that's $100,000.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.720]   If you see your $5 million account balance dip, that's a half a million dollars, and
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   so on.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.040]   And so I think validating that it's no fun to look at it is step one, because you do
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   want to recognize that this is not a fun environment when news and media are sort of so focused
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   on it.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   Especially if you're retired, that money going away, for a young person, a bear market
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.560]   or a correction is a blessing, because you're buying at lower prices.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.720]   If you're retired and you don't have any income coming in anymore, you see that money evaporate,
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.960]   but you're not building it back up with savings that you're going to be buying at lower prices.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.000]   So I understand why, even when you retire, it's even more nerve-wracking.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.560]   It's the flip side of that, which is a sequence of return risk, that early in retirement,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.720]   that hurts more.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.560]   So once that gets recognized, though, Ben, for me, the trick is then relate it to the
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   plan.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.360]   Because at our firm, we don't let somebody invest in any of our portfolios until they
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.320]   have a financial plan built, and we test through this.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.720]   We have the conversation.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   What are you going to do?
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   What is it going to feel like?
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.040]   We try to prep this.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.800]   So when we're going through it in real time, it's not the first time we've had the conversation
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.960]   about what a 10 percent, a 20 percent, a 30 percent decline, hypothetically, might look
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   like.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.240]   So part of our role as financial planners, as CFPs, as advisors, or even helping out
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.360]   your friends and family, your mom and dad, is always to make sure you're not investing
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.440]   in a portfolio that you can't sustain, the kind of drawdowns that we're experiencing
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440]   here.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.800]   And Ben, you know, this is a relatively minor situation so far, right?
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.400]   We don't know what this could turn into.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.240]   But we're all driving, looking at the rearview mirror.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.720]   And so we only know what happens.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.040]   And I think just that second part about always keeping in mind that we only know what happened
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.580]   last week or last month, we don't know what's going to happen next.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.580]   But here's data.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.680]   And Ben, that's why I think the work that you do, that our team does, is so important
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.520]   to show people this is what happens next.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.740]   The problem is, too, that most of the time you're in a state of a drawdown.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.120]   We anchor to these higher levels.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.160]   But so the data I've found is that 5 percent of all trading days is an all-time high for
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.480]   the stock market, going back like 100 years.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.280]   Alternatively, 95 percent of the time you're in a drawdown.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   And I looked at the data.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.280]   We talked about it last week.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   In the last 70 years, one out of every other two, one out of every other year is a 10 percent
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280]   drawdown or worse.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   Right?
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   So we're kind of in that now, right?
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.960]   And it's been, it usually doesn't work like a schedule like this, but it's been about
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.480]   two years since the last 10 percent correction in the S&P.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.600]   And unfortunately, it is normal, but it almost feels like you need that reminder every time
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.800]   it happens that this is normal.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   And wait a minute.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.880]   You know, I saw my account balance a month ago was much, much higher at the year end.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.880]   And now it's this.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880]   Oh, geez.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.880]   I can't.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   I can't take this.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   Get me out.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.220]   And again, we've tried to do a really good job with our clients of setting expectations,
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.800]   but there's always people who say like, OK, I know this is going to get worse.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.480]   Let's go to cash now.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.240]   Like just let's stop.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.240]   Stop the bleeding.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.480]   Go to cash and we'll reassess.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.280]   And that's why I like setting an asset allocation and understanding the risk profile and time
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.760]   horizon of your clients is so important because you have to set that ahead of time, right?
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.920]   You don't make a, you don't do it while you're in battle, right?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.320]   You do it before and you plan it, right?
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.280]   And so you figure out ahead of time and you figure, OK, what's a durable enough portfolio
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.680]   for me to handle these corrections and build them into the plan?
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.480]   Not like hope they don't happen because we know they're going to.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.400]   We just don't know when and we don't know why.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   And kind of pre-mortem it.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   I think that's what you're getting at.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.080]   Like, what, how should we react if this happens?
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.340]   And the answers are pretty, pretty standard.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.340]   It's rebalance.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.360]   It's deploy assets that you have in cash to pick up, you know, smaller balances.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.240]   But at the end of it, I think what clients really need to hear, what people need to hear,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.760]   what we all need to hear is it's going to be OK.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.160]   And if we have a plan going into it, going into battle, as you say, Ben, you're able
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.760]   to reference that and use that as your touchstone.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.480]   And if I know that, hey, this has happened several times, this on average happens every
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.180]   two years and it's nothing that you need to worry about.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.180]   That's the message.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.180]   It's going to be OK.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.840]   And I think if you're, if you're an individual investor watching this and you don't have
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.440]   an advisor you're leaning on and, you know, plenty of individuals can do this on itself,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.520]   but like even a bad plan is better than no plan, because I know there's a lot of investors
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.560]   right now who started a few years ago and they just decided I'm going to buy whatever
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.560]   works and it's going up and now it's down a lot and it's like, now what do I do?
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.920]   If you didn't have a plan going into it, figuring out a plan at the time is going to be ten
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   times harder.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.480]   Like, so again, even a bad plan is better than no plan.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.200]   It's a very expensive time to find out who you are.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.080]   Well, and as, as a little bit of a follow up, we have probably a ton of people right
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.800]   now who got into the market, young people who got into the market during the meme stock
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.260]   mania and that kind of thing.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.280]   And so they're probably really at a loss right now, like, you know, what is going on?
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.120]   Like this, you know, they were seeing names double over a week or, you know, that kind
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   of thing.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.720]   And it felt really easy there for a while.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.200]   And yeah, unfortunately it's not always going to be that way.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   That's the thing.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.680]   If you're in a more speculative part of the market, your swings are going to be even wider
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.080]   than a more diversified portfolio, like we use with our clients.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   It's tough.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.520]   Like on a brighter note, everyone in the chat now is sharing like all these great places
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520]   that they've traveled to.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   That's awesome.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520]   It's making me jealous.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.000]   When are we going to sit by a campfire?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.960]   It's like six degrees and it's like six degrees in Michigan.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.320]   I think we need to do this show from, you know, some exotic location or something.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   That sounds good.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   Let's do it.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.320]   My backyard.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   I did see some questions too.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   So we're going to pull those questions.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.320]   We'll get them in the future.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:53.840]   Remember, if you want to just email us and not put it in the comments here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.920]   Duncan, how close are we to 100,000 subscribers now?
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   Are we getting there?
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.720]   Very close, right around 94,000.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.720]   So we're getting there.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   That's awesome.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   All right.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   I like those big round numbers.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   Duncan's going to do 100k hat when we get there.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   We'll do that.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.920]   idontshop.com for all of your merchandise needs.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.840]   I think we have a Portfolio Rescue t-shirt there.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.120]   Ben doesn't drink coffee mug.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.240]   The compound hoodie sweatshirt that I have, I like that.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.840]   Thank you again to Bill for joining us.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   Keep your eyes peeled.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   We might be adding some kind of headwear at some point.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.120]   We haven't been happy with the tests we've done, but at some point there will probably
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.200]   be some headwear.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.640]   Duncan is a hat guy.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.680]   95% of all market downturns, Duncan has been wearing a hat.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.720]   We'll be back next week.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.400]   See you then.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.880]   See you everyone.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:51.240]   [Music]
