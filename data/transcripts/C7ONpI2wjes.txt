[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Most people think the microwave is like a quick place to reheat leftovers. I, in the last week,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.800]   have talked to a handful of people. All of them seemed like it was crazy when I told them we were
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.120]   cooking full meals in the microwave with like meat and fish. So what do you want to tell these people
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.320]   that think the microwave is not a way to cook? Because I think you've said it's the single
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.960]   best piece of equipment you have in your kitchen. I mean, it's a joke. It's like culinary arbitrage.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.440]   It's in like 91% of all US households collecting dust. And if people use it, it's usually for
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.720]   popcorn or for reheating leftovers or a mug of water for something. And the reality is,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:47.200]   I mean, it's not a joke. You press a button and things get hot. It's like the most magical
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.440]   element I could possibly think of. It's unfortunate that the UX and the UI is so bad on microwaves
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.560]   across the board and the marketing of it, because if the microwave technology came out today, I don't
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.920]   think you'd call it a microwave. That's what happens when you leave it to the military to
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.120]   come up with sort of marketing. It'd probably be called the turbo chef, right? Because that's what
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.560]   you use when you go into a Starbucks and they reheat all your food. It's a convection oven and
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.200]   a microwave, but it's called a turbo chef. And that's going to be coming to a kitchen near you.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.080]   And it's going to be marketed as the new convection oven that's going to dramatically top off 75% of
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.560]   your cooking time. And it will conveniently drop that it's using microwave technology to cook your
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.920]   food faster. People are using microwaves all the time, but when they go out to eat, they may not
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.200]   realize it. But ultimately, if you understand the science, you're using microwaves to effectively
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.560]   heat the water molecules inherent in foods. And that's all that's happening. And it's steaming in
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.520]   and of itself. So it's the most energy efficient way of cooking. I think the data will start to
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.360]   come out that it's probably again, if you cook for two hours, it's probably not right for the
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.880]   microwave, right? But for cooking, like, say, blanching some broccoli or something like that,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.960]   why would I take four liters of water take 12 minutes to bring that to a boil,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.320]   steam or boil my broccoli when I could do that in five minutes in a microwave, it's just
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.960]   more energy efficient. Number one, number two, it's going to be the most nutrient dense way of
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.440]   preserving all the stuff in your food, because there's no osmosis, there's nothing happening
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.400]   where you're going to lose any flavor or any nutrients to the water or to the outside environment.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.640]   So three, there's like, you can cook cleaner than anything else. I don't have to add anything
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.760]   to a microwave, right? Like, I don't have that oil, I don't have that fat. So it's
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.960]   theoretically, because you can make delicious things with no fats whatsoever. Basically,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   it's really good for anything that doesn't need to be crispy, right? Or long braise, for that
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.240]   matter, we're trying to break down, you know, muscle fibers, etc. So most people would think
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.600]   that it's crazy to cook a lobster in a microwave. Right? They'd say that's insane. That's the
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.640]   dumbest thing I've ever heard. And trust me, I used to be one of those people and tell like,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.120]   like, Oh, yeah, the science sort of makes sense. And not the science doesn't make just a sort of
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.960]   sense. It makes a lot of sense. And I'd argue that you could butter poach a lobster in the
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.720]   microwave within any day better than you could, and more consistently than any other way of cooking
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.600]   lobster. That's crazy. I haven't I haven't made it to that point. And for anyone listening that
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.720]   isn't familiar with any day, it's a set of microwave cookware. That is not just for the
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.920]   microwave. The one thing you didn't put in your points was the thing you're cooking with is also
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.000]   the thing that you can store leftovers with and the thing that you can put on the plate to serve
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.960]   with. And you can and you can put it in an oven, you know, so it's like, so this morning, I just
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.120]   made I had a package of Korean wheat noodles, fresh noodles. I had a package of like one and a
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.920]   half pounds of frozen chicken thighs. I had some leftover shiitake mushrooms, I had a couple cloves
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.680]   of garlic. We're leaving town on Friday. So I just want to use all the stuff we have in the house.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.000]   And now that I'm at the office a lot more the studio, I'm cooking all my meals ahead of time.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.720]   So my wife, whoever's at home, they can still have a freshly cooked meal, they're just reheating it
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:31.680]   usually in any day. So I took a large deep any day, I took out the chicken thighs, and I put it
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.600]   in them, I covered it in any day and I microwaved it for about seven and a half minutes. I took out a
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.680]   pair of scissors, and it's still raw in the center, right, this block of frozen chicken thighs,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.600]   and I just cut it up. Again, seems insane. Taking scissors, you know, kitchen shears,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.400]   and I'm cutting into little bits. The main reason why is as a home cook, I don't want to
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.120]   wash more dishes than I need to. I'm always worried about cross contamination with poultry.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.280]   So it's not like I want to use chicken, put it on. So if I take the chicken raw, put it on a
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.880]   cutting board, I have now chicken all over my my hands, I'm going to cut it. So I have to wash the
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.320]   knife, I have to wash the cutting board, I have to wash my hands multiple times, if you're going
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.880]   to do it correctly. And now if I just do it in the any day, I don't even have to wash my hands,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.200]   because I've never touched chicken, I put the lid on, cook it for about seven and a half minutes.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.160]   So it's thawed out, but the center is still going to be raw. I'm going to I could cook it all the
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.840]   way, but there's no need. And so I'm taking frozen chicken. Usually, if I have to defrost it, that's
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.400]   at least a day. But you know, how else are you going to defrost it, you have to like just leave
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.560]   it out. So I've done that a seven and a half minutes defrosted. Now I've chopped it up in the
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.200]   bits. I've taken the garlic and I've taken the shiitake mushrooms, I've added some, you know,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.520]   momo soy sauce, some dark soy sauce, some agave, some neutral oil, and I'm just sauteing that
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.480]   added some scallions. And as that's cooking, I added the my chopped chicken and all the juices
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.720]   that accumulated and pretty much saute that for like a minute. And then I add the noodles that I
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.360]   cooked, you know, reseason and I'm ready to go. Put it back into any day and they're going to
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:23.840]   reheat that for lunch. So again, is it pretty? Absolutely not. But I'm not like cooking for
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.960]   an audience other than my family. The final product looks delicious, tastes delicious, but
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.680]   you know, it was a roundabout way of getting there, but it was extremely quick. I cooked that
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.440]   in 10 minutes. You know, while the water was boiling, I microwaved the chicken. So to do
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.520]   a delicious dish in 10 minutes, I mean, it's hard to beat.
