[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.860]   - There's a real paradox that we've got to face
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.240]   with personal financial planning
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.140]   when it comes to our income and income sources.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.100]   And the paradox is this, the more specialized you become,
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.280]   the higher the potential for higher income.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.340]   However, the more specialized you become,
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.820]   the more vulnerable you are to changes
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.580]   in the market condition.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.820]   So how do we balance the need for specialization
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.820]   for profit potential with the need for diversification
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.780]   for the purposes of developing safety?
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.260]   Today, my thoughts and suggestions for you.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:25.560]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.420]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.940]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.260]   This is the show where each and every day I work with you,
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.340]   virtually of course, to help you build and implement
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.460]   a plan for financial independence.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.940]   And basically every day we wander around
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.100]   the same major themes, practically five of them.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.460]   And today we talk about increasing income
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.060]   and avoiding catastrophe and how those integrate together.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.220]   Today's show comes as the result of a question
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.340]   from one of the patrons of the show.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.740]   At the highest level of patronage,
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.900]   the $200 a month level, one of the benefits of that level
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.980]   is that you get to request a show topic
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.100]   and I create it for you.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.580]   And today's show is the result of a question
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.380]   from one of the patrons.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.460]   The question came in in this format.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.980]   So Joshua, how can I balance the risk and return profile
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.200]   of having one focused all in business?
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.760]   As an example, a financial advisor
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.280]   who's just trying to scale up with more clients
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.020]   versus having multiple,
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.520]   but perhaps not directly related businesses.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.900]   Businesses that are diversified,
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.740]   but there's less ability to leverage knowledge
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.520]   and direct expertise across all activities.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.000]   So that was the inspiration for today's show.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.500]   I'm gonna expand it beyond the context of business
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.960]   because I think there are some principles
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.160]   that can be applied both in the context of business
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.580]   and in the context of employment.
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.920]   They're really simple.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.640]   As an employee, you are the master of your own business.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.880]   You are the president
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.280]   of your own personal services corporation,
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.840]   as I like to think about it.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.600]   And your best client just simply happens
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.360]   to be whoever your employer is right now.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.680]   I think that's a very useful way to think about your job.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.880]   And I think that if you think about it in that context,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.560]   then it makes the principles universally applicable.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.960]   But the decisions that we face are really challenging.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.080]   If you look at the world around,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.860]   and here are just a few of my premises
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.240]   as part of our introduction,
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.080]   you I think will find that specialization
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.620]   is the key to wealth.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.280]   This has been a long known economic concept
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.020]   and I guess probably popularized
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.400]   with the work of Adam Smith,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.420]   200 and what, almost 250 years ago.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.660]   And that was the,
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.820]   he was one of the first people
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.980]   who remarked on the division of labor.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.140]   His famous example, I think the pin factory
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.100]   and how if you made,
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.100]   if you brought the making of pins
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.380]   down to a specialized services,
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.460]   then you could produce many more pins
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.000]   than a master pin maker could do
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.060]   doing it all by themselves.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.560]   And that has driven really in many ways
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.060]   the development of the free market economy
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.460]   in which we live.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.060]   And the more specialized you are,
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.220]   the more productive you are able to be personally,
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.600]   also the more productive the economy is as a whole.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.500]   And also because we often measure productivity
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.220]   in terms of financial benefit,
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.860]   the more money you're gonna make.
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.700]   But how do we balance that with the risk that comes in?
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.460]   Most of us would be dead if we destroyed
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.740]   the overall specialized,
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.300]   highly divided labor economy that we live in.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.820]   If all of a sudden something happened
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.620]   that caused that division of labor economy to fall apart,
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.260]   most of us would be dead in a few months.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.920]   We have no ability to create the,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.620]   to create the needs that we live.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.100]   How many of us could build our own modest shelter
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.460]   to live in overnight,
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.800]   let alone build a house that would keep our children warm
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.660]   and keep the rain off of our heads?
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.540]   How many of us could extract food out of the ground
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.300]   with any kind of sustainable regularity?
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.660]   It'd be very, very difficult.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.980]   Thankfully, the economy in which we live is quite resilient.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.580]   And somehow through the miracle of the free market,
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.260]   we don't go through many of the shortages and problems
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.860]   that many other people have gone through throughout history.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.900]   But this is always a threat.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.700]   Now, I'm not gonna dig into severe disaster planning.
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.300]   We're not gonna try to talk about the end of the world
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.140]   as we know it today,
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.780]   although that's certainly a worthy topic of conversation.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.400]   But today we're just gonna keep it simple
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.140]   and talk about it in terms of the metrics of profit.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.940]   How do we get through this?
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.620]   So specialization is the key to wealth.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.260]   So I think about it as a paradox
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.820]   between specialization being the key to wealth
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.600]   and diversification being the key to safety.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.260]   And safety is often the key to personal happiness,
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.220]   or at least resiliency can help you
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.660]   to get through more aspects of life.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.760]   And I'm gonna share with you some ideas.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.500]   Before I share those ideas with you though,
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   I wanna cover our sponsors.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.660]   Sponsor of the day number one
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.660]   is the YNAB budgeting software.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.420]   YNAB is an acronym that stands for You Need a Budget.
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.820]   And the special thing about YNAB
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.840]   is that this was actually the number one
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.380]   most requested advertiser by you, the listening audience.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.680]   Many episodes ago in the show,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.660]   I put out a request and said,
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.340]   "I'm thinking about bringing on advertisers.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.020]   And if you have a suggestion
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.100]   for who you'd like to see on the show, send me an email."
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.580]   That day I received multiple emails.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.260]   Ultimately I received over a dozen emails
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.300]   from people saying, "You should get YNAB.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.120]   I love YNAB.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.040]   You should get YNAB.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.020]   I love YNAB."
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.260]   So of course I reached out to YNAB
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.700]   and requested that we talk
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.480]   and we were able to arrange a business relationship
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.620]   and I brought them on the show as an advertiser.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.900]   But YNAB is really a brilliant piece of software
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.100]   because it solves many of the budgeting problems
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.340]   that we face brilliantly.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.260]   And it allows you to get control
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.940]   at the most basic, basic level.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.340]   You will never achieve and maintain
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.220]   massive long-term wealth
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.940]   unless you are able to maintain control of your finances.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.780]   But people often make a mistake and they say,
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.300]   "Well, if I have lots of money,
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.280]   then I'll learn how to manage it."
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.120]   Well, guess what?
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.420]   Some people blunder into lots of money,
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.940]   but because they don't know how to manage it,
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.940]   the money quickly flitters out of their life.
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.140]   And so the key is manage the money that you have
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.460]   and over time, you may have more to manage.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.480]   If you are effective with managing the money that you have,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.980]   over time, you'll have more to manage.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.700]   And YNAB is a brilliantly useful tool.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.760]   This is the tool that I use for all of my personal budgeting
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.980]   after trying it out again.
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.380]   And by the way, for the whole story on that,
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.460]   go listen to episode 246,
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.180]   was an interview with the founder, Jesse Mecham,
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.300]   and you can hear my long story with YNAB.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.580]   But after trying it out again,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.080]   I immediately saw the brilliance
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.100]   of their updated software solution
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.820]   and switched all of my personal and business accounting
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.340]   over to the YNAB platform, and I love it.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.680]   So you can try it with a free 30-day trial
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.060]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab, Y-N-A-B.

[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.900]   They have some really good classes and webinars
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.200]   where they teach you how to use it,
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.540]   how to manage the fundamentals of your budget,

[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.040]   If you don't like it, you don't have to buy it.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.460]   If you do like it and you wanna buy it,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.780]   it's very reasonably priced.
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.860]   I don't remember the exact number.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.580]   I think it's somewhere in like the $60 range.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.220]   But it's a great, great software package.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.340]   I strongly recommend it.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.780]   At least try the free version.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.100]   And please use that tracking link
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.300]   so I get credit for your downloads.

[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.540]   Sponsor of the day number two is Paladin Registry,
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.260]   and I'm thrilled to bring you Paladin Registry
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.460]   because this was also a solution
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.300]   to the most requested problem on the show.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.820]   Biggest question I get, Joshua,
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.020]   how can I find a great financial advisor?
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.700]   And my standard answer, I don't know.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.420]   So I worked on that and worked on that for months,
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.060]   and ultimately the best solution I've been able
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.460]   to come up with so far at least has been Paladin Registry.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.160]   Paladin Registry is a registry service
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.060]   and a vetting service for financial advisors.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.380]   Their founder, Jack Waymire,
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.580]   was a former financial advisor himself,
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.740]   and he was frustrated with how hard it is
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.180]   to be confident of the character and integrity
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.020]   and skill and qualifications of a financial advisor.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.720]   So he created this service called Paladin Registry.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.780]   For details, listen to episode 248 of the show
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.460]   over an hour interview with Jack
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.600]   where we talk about the process
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.020]   of finding a financial advisor.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.580]   We talk about how and why Paladin was created
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.220]   and what they do, how they vet their advisors,
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.500]   all of that stuff in detail in episode 248.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.080]   And then if you'd like to consider interviewing
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.100]   some financial advisors in your area,
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.100]   go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.480]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.900]   The way it works is that will take you through
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.040]   to a landing page.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.780]   You'll put in your name, your phone number,
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.580]   your email address, and where you live,
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.120]   and your zip code, and then the amount of assets
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.460]   that you have that are under consideration.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.940]   They'll use that information,
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.280]   and they will send you some information
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.500]   of some advisors that are close to your area
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.660]   that you can be able to use and speak to
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.420]   to see if those advisors might be good for you.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.700]   You don't have to hire them.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.740]   I don't get paid any more or less
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.500]   if you hire them or don't hire them, so that's no problem.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.260]   But at least start with interviewing them
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.820]   and see if some of them might be able to serve you.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.380]   Let's dig into our major question now.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.780]   Let's start with a simple example
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.620]   of the importance of specialization.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.300]   And think of, simplistically, a young worker,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.320]   fresh out of school, just entering into the labor market.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.220]   Most young workers that are in this situation
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.000]   really don't have a lot of skills
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.380]   or areas of specialization.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.560]   Perhaps if they've gone to some sort of university training
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.500]   or gone through some kind of training program,
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.900]   they might have more skills
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.220]   and more of a specialized market,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.060]   and we'll get to that in a moment,
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.640]   but many of them don't.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.260]   And so when you look at the labor market,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.900]   that means they have a huge job market available to them.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.900]   Non-specialized laborers have a massive job market,
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.860]   but they also have limited potential
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.260]   because you must be more specialized
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.220]   in order to earn a higher income.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.360]   And this is a real challenge
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.900]   to manage from a career perspective.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.500]   Think about the example of a restaurant worker.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   Let's say you get a job as a restaurant server.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.860]   What's your risk if the restaurant that you're working for
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.940]   goes out of business?
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.420]   Well, it's very little.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.980]   You can just go and find another restaurant
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.820]   and get another job,
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.300]   and there's restaurant jobs all over the place.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.020]   Perhaps you might be subjective
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.820]   to the seasonality of employment demand.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.400]   You might be subjected to changes in the local economy,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.440]   a growing town, a shrinking town,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.460]   but if you wanna work in a job as a restaurant server,
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.220]   you can pretty much work a job as a restaurant server.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.540]   There is plenty of labor
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.020]   and there's plenty of jobs available.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.420]   Now, you're not gonna make all that much money
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.100]   because there's plenty of labor
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.940]   and there's plenty of jobs available.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.380]   And the job in and of itself is pretty basic.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.500]   All my friends who've been servers
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.780]   like to tell me, "Joshua, you don't know how hard it is."
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.460]   I'm not saying it's not easy.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.500]   I'm not saying it's not work, but it's pretty basic.
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.900]   It doesn't take a whole lot of training
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.500]   to figure out how to do the job.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.020]   Well, what if you become a little bit more specialized?
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.340]   So instead of just becoming a generic restaurant worker,
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.640]   you perhaps get a job as a high-end steak restaurant
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.140]   that's known for a higher level of service.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.880]   Well, now you're increasing your potential for income,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.140]   but you're also increasing your risk
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:59.240]   because there aren't as many fine dining steakhouses
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.140]   in your town as there are restaurants.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.380]   So if that's your area of specialty,
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.220]   you have a higher risk,
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.900]   but you also have a higher potential return for your work.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.400]   So you gotta manage these two things together.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.080]   You wanna go specialized because that's going to result
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.700]   in more income, but you also have to be careful
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.300]   because the more and more specialized you go,
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.900]   the smaller and smaller the market.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.140]   It's the same whether it's selling the products
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.460]   of your business or selling your personal product
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.860]   of personal services to a company.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.860]   I do not believe that there is one answer to this problem.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.660]   Rather, I think the answer is to be aware of the risks
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.400]   that you face and how these things will change
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.580]   over your lifetime.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.060]   If you're advising a young man or young woman,
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.660]   you would encourage them to become specialized.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.500]   That's why we send people to school.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.780]   We sell people to go get a college degree.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.960]   What is that supposed to be doing?
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.300]   Well, it's supposed to be giving you a specialized knowledge
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.220]   or if you go to a trade school, what are you doing?
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.060]   Well, you're getting into a more specialized market.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.620]   If you go and learn how to weld,
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.680]   now you have access to the welding market.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.500]   And as a qualified, competent, perhaps certified welder,
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.480]   you're going to earn a higher wage
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.980]   than just a general assistant on a welding shop.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.600]   But you're also exposing yourself to the risk.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.720]   So early in the career, you wanna specialize,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.300]   but you also wanna stay broad
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.180]   because you don't know what's the best area
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.460]   of specialization.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.540]   And that's where diversification comes in.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.020]   If somebody has a lot of experience
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.140]   in a lot of different fields, a lot of different industries,
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.940]   they're gonna have a better idea
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.700]   of where they should specialize.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.040]   But at some point, you've gotta really commit.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.380]   You gotta go all in and you've gotta get
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.440]   from the bottom of the stack to the top.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.000]   This is where the Pareto principle comes in.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.240]   The Pareto principle, also referred to
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.140]   as the 80/20 principle, for some reason
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.780]   that I don't know how to explain,
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.560]   seems to govern just about everything in life.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.400]   It governs who has the wealth,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.280]   it governs who earns the income,
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.400]   it governs who provides the results,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.040]   and it should be governing your career pattern.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.800]   But if you go out in just about any field,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.580]   the history of it, if it's your first exposure,
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.880]   there was an Italian, as a legend goes,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.440]   there was an Italian economist named Vilfredo Pareto
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.920]   who was out looking at his pea plants.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.200]   And he started doing an analysis,
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.400]   because this is what Italian economists do
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.680]   when they're working in their garden
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.200]   is they start counting the peas.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.640]   And he realized that 20% of his pea plants
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.240]   were producing 80% of the peas.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.100]   And 80% of the pea plants were producing 20%.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.160]   Well, he extrapolated that
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.520]   and started measuring other markets.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.840]   And today, this has been proven to be true
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.240]   in many industries.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.940]   20% of the world's population owns 80% of the wealth.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.760]   80% of the world's population owns 20% of the wealth.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.400]   In any field, 20% of the field will earn 80% of the income.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.860]   I used to measure this when I was in sales,
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.040]   I would look at the sales reports,
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.960]   and I would try to run through and figure out,
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.800]   is this true?
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.440]   Just with my own unscientific approach,
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.100]   and I found it was usually pretty right
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.440]   that about 20% of the salespeople at an insurance company
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.320]   produce 80% of the sales.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.320]   So the key is, how do you go from the bottom 80%
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.480]   to the top 20%?
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.040]   Well, you're gonna get there with specialization.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.440]   But once you do, you're gonna have more and more benefits,
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.760]   more and more rewards.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.960]   Incidentally, the 80/20 rule is also applied
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.800]   at the higher levels.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   So the top 20% of the top 20% earn 80% of the income,
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.880]   or have 80% of the wealth of that top 20%.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.320]   And then the top 20% of the top 20% have 80%
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.680]   of the top 20% of the wealth,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.060]   and it goes on and on and on.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.740]   I've done this, do this sometimes for fun
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.320]   when I read studies about income inequality
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.600]   and wealth inequality, and everyone's all upset about,
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.080]   everyone's all upset about who has all the money in society.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.980]   And if you run the numbers, what you find, though,
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.900]   is you basically find a massive Pareto distribution.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.720]   You always find the top 20% of the top 20%
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.680]   of the top 20% of the top 20% own 80% of the top,
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.720]   you know, 80% of the wealth.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.460]   And it breaks down, I ran the numbers,
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.560]   I don't have them at my fingertips,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.740]   but I read an article, it was about 1/10 of 1%
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.180]   of the world's population owns 50% of the wealth,
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.000]   something like that.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.900]   I ran the numbers, and it was exactly what would be expected
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.760]   based upon a Pareto distribution.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.060]   Now, why is that the case?
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.140]   I don't have a clue, it just is.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.700]   And it's the same in every field,
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.860]   it's the same in every industry.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.020]   And the useful thing for you is that you can apply
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.260]   this knowledge to your field and to your industry.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.760]   But what you'll see is that if you wanna go
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.600]   from the bottom 80% to the top 20% of income earners,
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.520]   you're going to have to become more specialized.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.740]   And if you wanna do it again,
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.700]   you're gonna have to become more specialized still.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:46.720]   But what do we do with the risk that specialization brings?
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.640]   Let's talk for a moment the language of stock investing,
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.120]   'cause that's where we usually are talking
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.880]   about diversification.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.160]   And I can't prove this, I haven't seen studies on this.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.120]   If anybody can prove or disprove this
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.480]   with any research material that you have found,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.440]   feel free to comment on today's show notes
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.340]   and post links to articles proving or disproving this.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.640]   But I would bet a good amount of money
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.120]   that if you went through and reviewed the portfolios
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.760]   of various investment managers,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.200]   you would find that 20% of the stocks
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.320]   produce 80% of the results.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   And 20% of the top 20% produce 80% of those results.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.480]   The way those numbers work out is that the top 4%
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.560]   would produce 64% of your results.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.920]   And I bet it breaks down more and more and more.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.480]   The place I've seen this most clearly
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.320]   is usually in venture capital,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.640]   where they find a couple of unicorns,
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.040]   maybe one unicorn, one massive winner,
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.180]   and that makes up for a whole long string of losers.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.520]   So why do we diversify?
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.620]   We diversify for safety.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.580]   But what do we give up by diversifying a stock portfolio?
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.500]   We give up potential returns.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.420]   Or probably said more precisely,
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.140]   we give up the opportunity for huge returns.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.640]   Because there's always gonna be some money
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.080]   that we didn't put on the big bet.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.220]   Now, look at the richest people in the world
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.120]   and show me one person who got there
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.440]   with a diversified portfolio.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.980]   I've never seen him.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.200]   I'm not aware and I couldn't cite,
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.540]   I would put money on the fact that he doesn't exist.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.220]   Whether it's the Forbes 400
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.340]   or any list of the top rich people in the world,
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.520]   show me a person who got there with diversification
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.160]   and I'll do whatever the appropriate humble thing
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.420]   is to eat my words.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.720]   I don't think they exist.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.580]   Or at least they don't exist in the beginning.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.520]   There might be people there who are diversified
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.160]   after they've gotten rich,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.580]   but nobody gets rich with diversification.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.120]   Look at the richest people in your town
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.680]   and show me one person who got there
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.340]   with diversification in their career.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.620]   Doesn't exist.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.280]   The rich people in your town got rich
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.280]   either because they had one business that became massive
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.960]   or because they became a highly paid professional
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.080]   in their career in an area of specialty
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.840]   that was valued in the marketplace.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   But should we then continue to bet it all on something?
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.440]   Well, maybe in the beginning
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.240]   if we can afford to lose it all
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.840]   or if we have a good enough backup plan
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.740]   to move to after we lose it all.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.560]   But we've gotta pay attention
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.280]   to that diversification over time.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.840]   And I'm convinced this is the way
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.440]   that we should be looking at it
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.640]   is let me specialize but also diversify
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.440]   for my specific risks.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.040]   And if you do both of those things,
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.200]   you can make a major difference over time.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.580]   When I was a financial advisor,
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.440]   I was very uncomfortable with the idea
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.560]   of having all of my income tied to stocks.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.240]   And so the way the financial advice business works
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.960]   is as you start to build a practice,
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.120]   you're gonna be earning fees
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.180]   off of your investment management revenues.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.680]   And if your fees are tied to usually a percentage
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.800]   of the assets under management,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.720]   let's just use 1% as a good generalization,
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.100]   what that means is your income is largely due
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.080]   to the value of the accounts.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.900]   Well, if you go into a situation where all of a sudden
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.000]   the value of the accounts declines by 20 or 30%,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.120]   which can happen in any random year in the stock market,
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.960]   that's gonna be a massive impact on your income.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.160]   It's gonna cause a 20 or 30% direct decline in income,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.420]   even if no clients leave, and it's probable
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.760]   that some clients are starting to start
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.160]   to get nervous in that situation.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.880]   When I started in the financial advice business in 2008,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.840]   I was surrounded by hurting financial advisors
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   who were going through severe shortfalls
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.920]   because their income was down substantially.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.160]   And I was surrounded by hurting mortgage brokers
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.780]   who were falling apart and losing everything.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.120]   I was surrounded by hurting construction builders
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.860]   who had put it all on housing,
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.000]   and they had built spec houses,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.080]   and they still own three of them,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.160]   and the value was plummeting,
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.040]   and they'd spent all their money on boats,
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.460]   but their investments were all in real estate.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.840]   And now the value of the real estate is going down.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.120]   That was a formative thing for me where I said,
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.120]   I'm never gonna have all of my investments
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.360]   tied to this one thing.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.520]   So I focused very heavily on specializing
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.480]   and going after the highest value activities
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.600]   and markets that I could go after,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.280]   but I also always thought about how can I diversify?
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.280]   And I think that the financial advice business
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.080]   is a good metaphor, and you'll have to figure out
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.880]   how to apply it in your own world.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.580]   But the specialty that I could go after was financial advice
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.640]   or the specialty I chose to go after.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.380]   But I wanted to diversify my income,
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.720]   so I worked to have specialized clients,
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.260]   but to diversify income sources,
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.720]   have insurance revenues, have investment revenues,
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.640]   and then I worked to diversify my own portfolio.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.880]   So that would mean diversify the portfolio
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.760]   within the standard asset classes,
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.240]   but for me at that time, I was looking to say,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.240]   how can I diversify my own personal investments
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.440]   out of stocks?
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.440]   Because I don't wanna have all of my income
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.280]   and all of my investments tied to stocks.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.600]   This is what's so deadly if you're not thinking
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.640]   in terms of diversification.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.200]   If I, let's say I went through some,
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.440]   I was accused of some financial crime,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.980]   and this financial crime was exposed
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.600]   right in a period of market turmoil,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.480]   and now I lose my license, and I all of a sudden
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.800]   am facing the closure of my business,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.760]   I lose all my clients, I lose all my revenue,
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.480]   and it's coming usually at a time
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.880]   when there was fraud in the marketplace.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.480]   That's when people sue with financial advisors,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.080]   when there's fraud in the marketplace.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.860]   So the markets are down, they're all on a heap,
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.900]   and now all of my financial stability is not there.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.320]   So for me as a financial advisor,
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   I wanted to be very careful of having everything
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.960]   invested in stocks.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.000]   And I think you can find the area
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.120]   that would be applicable to you.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.540]   You can apply in any business the concepts
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.940]   of specialization and diversification simultaneously.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.440]   To repeat for a moment from the financial advisor space,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.320]   the specialty that you can go after
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.520]   in the financial advisor space
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.160]   that would be the wisest specialty
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.320]   is a specialty of client,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.080]   working with one specific type of client.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.880]   That allows you to develop your expertise
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.200]   and to be known as the go-to guy or the go-to gal
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.220]   for one specific market opportunity.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.640]   As a specialist, you'll be sought out.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.180]   And the more specialized you can go, the better.
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.360]   But within that specialty, you should look to diversify.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.440]   For example, let's say that you are going to specialize
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.080]   in working with the financial needs of,
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.400]   I don't know, I'll pick on since Ben Carson
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.260]   is running for president, pediatric neurosurgeons.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.500]   The pediatric neurosurgery community
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.240]   is a very small community.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.880]   And so if that were your chosen specialty,
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.700]   you could develop a real area of expertise
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.840]   within that specialty to reach that community.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.200]   But you could also diversify that
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.980]   by working with pediatric neurosurgeons
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.500]   all across the country.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.460]   You could diversify by developing a practice
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.000]   that helped pediatric neurosurgeons
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.580]   with their investment needs,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.200]   but also with their insurance needs,
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.760]   and also with their accounting needs,
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.320]   and also with their budgeting needs,
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.260]   and also with their kids' college needs.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.260]   That way you're lowering the risk in your specialty
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.400]   by both building a stronger client relationship
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.320]   because you're working with them in more areas,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.080]   and by leveraging multiple areas of income sources
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.220]   so that if a client leaves,
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.380]   or if the client's finances are dramatically affected,
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.480]   it's not all riding on one area.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.760]   The thought process is what will create those strong results
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.820]   and start to build resilience in your career
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.620]   and resilience in your business.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.380]   I used financial advisor examples here
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.180]   because many of the listeners are financial advisors,
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.540]   and this particular question came from someone
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.860]   who is a financial advisor and who is facing this problem.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.100]   In a moment, I'll go on to other areas,
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.940]   but what would be a mistake as a financial advisor
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.520]   is to try to diversify across all markets
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.980]   where you don't have the ability to capitalize.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.820]   So that's why you need a specialty,
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.060]   you need an area of expertise,
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   you need a real specialty,
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.540]   and then you diversify within that.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.300]   Now, there comes a stage in, I think, all of our lives
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.980]   at which we've built our fortunes,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.800]   we've started to make a substantial gain,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.740]   and we wanna be careful about how far we go with that.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.920]   The best example that comes to mind is that dentist
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:45.180]   that caused an international, I guess, furor some months ago
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.460]   when he killed the lion over in Africa,
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.660]   and everyone's all upset at him.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.160]   So the day before the news story,
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.000]   he has an active, thriving practice,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.860]   and he has loads of happy customers,
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.380]   he's obviously making plenty of money,
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.080]   he's traveling around the world hunting
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.620]   and earning lots of money,
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.580]   has lots of customers,
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.400]   and he may have had a very diversified business.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.300]   He may have helped clients in different areas,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.420]   he may have had clients from various walks of life,
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.500]   so he had a diversified business.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.820]   But he'd built his fortune.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.580]   And here's the problem, his business was utterly destroyed
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.180]   after everyone starts getting mad at him
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.220]   for killing the lion.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.540]   Destroyed overnight, utterly destroyed.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.980]   So in that context, what was his backup plan?
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.180]   I hope he had one, I don't have any idea if he did or not,
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.100]   but what was his backup plan?
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.780]   And this, in the world that we live in,
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.140]   is probably just an incredibly important thing
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.500]   for all of us to consider.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.060]   Another example that comes to mind was that lady
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.980]   who was a marketing executive and posted a tweet
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.140]   about something about going to Africa
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.940]   and hope I don't get AIDS.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.920]   And there was the whole furor that happened on Twitter
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.660]   that resulted by the time she landed
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.300]   in the airport in Africa, she was fired from her job,
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.580]   and basically half the internet world
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.460]   knows about her and hated her.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.860]   How do you recover from that?
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.700]   You've got to have some fallback plans.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.540]   And so I look at it and I say, go back to your goals.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.460]   What's the appropriate level of safety for you?
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.460]   What's the minimum level?
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.180]   And work to secure that so that no matter what happens,
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.060]   you can move on to the next thing.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.720]   This is where being debt-free is so powerful,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.700]   because if you're debt-free,
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.580]   you don't put yourself at the risk of wipeout risk.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.380]   Do you get slower results?
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.060]   Probably, but you avoid wipeout risk.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.300]   And at the end of the day, that is the bigger risk.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.180]   You can't spend, if you've got a billion dollars,
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.980]   you're never gonna spend it all.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.340]   If you've got a million, you might spend it all,
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.680]   but most people who are millionaires
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.060]   aren't going to be able to.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.380]   So the key is set some minimum level
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.020]   and then ratchet up, protect.
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.620]   Set and protect.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.060]   So with that dentist, I hope that he was
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.120]   taking some of his income, and in addition to spending it,
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.940]   he was diversifying out.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.720]   Diversifying into an intelligently built
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.040]   investment portfolio,
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.460]   diversifying into other businesses perhaps,
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.380]   diversifying with regard to other interests.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.700]   And hopefully he was keeping a strong network of some kind
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.620]   so that he could have other fallback plans.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.920]   I use those two examples because they're vivid examples
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.820]   that most of you should be familiar with.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.180]   And I think they're worth paying attention to.
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.420]   At any point in time in today's world,
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.900]   you anger the wrong person
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.340]   and they can destroy your primary business.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.500]   So we need that fallback plan.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.580]   Gotta build the primary business.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.820]   Generally, people who are out to destroy
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.740]   don't go after people who are broke
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.880]   and bankrupt and living on the street.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.020]   But once you've built it,
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.820]   you've gotta diversify and protect.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.520]   Let me share with you a couple of ideas
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.380]   of some other alternative characteristics,
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.420]   and I'll just show you how I would see these things
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.340]   applying in different areas.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.780]   Let's assume that you've built a career for yourself,
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.560]   working in a job in an industry
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.120]   that is prone to ups and downs.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.260]   I was really struggling to come up with an industry
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.840]   to use as an example that would be widely understood.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.860]   The best I came up with was actually the military.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.640]   So consider for a moment the area of specialization
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.880]   within joining the military.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.680]   Let's talk about the US military.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.140]   If you can join the US Army or the US Navy as a grunt
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.260]   and you're just a basic low-level employee,
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.140]   well, what do you do to increase your income?
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.360]   First thing you do is you increase your income
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.140]   by moving up in ranks.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.000]   So that's where specialization comes in.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.700]   More work is required,
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.840]   but it also comes with more income potential.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.060]   Not a huge income potential,
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.960]   but there is more income potential.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.740]   What is the other area and way
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.540]   in which you specialize in the military?
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.140]   It would be specialization of area of focus.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.160]   So if you go from being an Army infantry person
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   to a Navy SEAL or a Green Beret
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.740]   or one of the special forces,
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.220]   you're automatically becoming more specialized.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.800]   You're gonna develop along the way certain skills
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.420]   that will lead to your differentiation.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.120]   These aren't always measured with money
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.040]   in the military world, but they might be.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.640]   But the basic skill, the most famous these days,
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.300]   it gets to get all the press, is the Navy SEALs.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.040]   What's the basic skill of a Navy SEAL?
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.840]   Killing people effectively.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.920]   So that's a very, very highly specialized skill,
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.820]   and some of the guys in that world
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.500]   are the best in the world at it.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.940]   But it's also a skill for which
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.200]   there aren't that many employers.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.160]   The life and the career prospects
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.740]   of somebody who is going out of being in the Navy SEALs
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.440]   or the Green Berets or some type of specialized option
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.020]   like that is very limited.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.300]   The market for people with highly skilled
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.580]   in killing people is limited.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:00.080]   You can go join a special military contracting company
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.160]   or go be a soldier for hire somewhere.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.460]   That's possible.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.500]   Or you wind up in other areas of law enforcement,
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.020]   other areas of protection careers,
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.580]   bodyguards, that type of thing.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.980]   That's where those skills are relatable.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.100]   But ultimately, the specialization leads to risk,
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.340]   and it leads to a very small market for services.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.700]   And once you leave the SEALs,
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.440]   there aren't gonna be that many other jobs
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.980]   that are ever gonna match the excitement
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.860]   of being in the SEALs.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.140]   But what do you do from a career perspective?
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.340]   Well, if you analyze and you look,
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.880]   in order to achieve specialization,
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.580]   you've also built diversified skills along the way.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.660]   So that's where you see people, I see all the time,
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.500]   the Navy SEAL guide to leadership,
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.740]   or the Navy SEAL guide to physical fitness,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.800]   or blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.740]   It's taking some area of diversification
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.740]   and then offering it as a more highly specialized area.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.060]   All of us have the opportunity to do that.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.260]   And that's where, along the way, as you're a specialist,
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.260]   you should also be diversified and be a generalist.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.580]   You should be widely reading, widely knowledgeable,
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.860]   and then looking for those skills that translate over.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.460]   For me, one of the skills that I learned,
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.740]   and one of the primary reasons why, years ago,
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.400]   I joined Northwestern Mutuals, I wanted to learn to sell.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   I had the narrow skill set of financial knowledge,
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.520]   and I knew I could learn that,
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.840]   but I wanted the broad skill set of selling.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.480]   Once you've learned the skill of selling in one field,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.360]   that should be more translatable over to another field.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.660]   So along the way, pay attention to the principles
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.400]   that are universally applicable.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.100]   In conclusion, I believe the answer to this paradox
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.440]   is to do both, and simply primarily to be aware
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.180]   of both truths within the context
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.460]   of your own personal situation.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.460]   Recognize that what I'm sharing today is a crossover
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.540]   between points number one and four
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.460]   of my framework for wealth.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.180]   So point one is increase income.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.080]   Point four, excuse me, point five,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.380]   yeah, point four is avoid catastrophe.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.540]   And so at every stage along the way,
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.140]   you can be holding these things practically together
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:15.260]   and saying, how do I increase income?
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.340]   But also, what exposure does that open up for me?
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.540]   What risk does that take for me?
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.340]   How do I avoid catastrophe?
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.300]   In your specialized scenario,
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.340]   in your specialized situation,
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.660]   there is an answer that can handle
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.320]   both of these things together.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.460]   If you are a pediatric neurosurgeon,
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.420]   you have a very specialized skill set,
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.520]   and you avoid catastrophe by purchasing
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.140]   excellent disability insurance coverage
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.780]   so that if you lose the use of your hands,
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.720]   you're protected there for at least
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.940]   some of your income with disability insurance.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.840]   You also keep it and maintain it
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.540]   by being broadly read within your field
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.200]   so that if you had to pass from pediatric neurosurgery
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.460]   into another area of neurosurgery, you could do that.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.860]   Or if you could no longer be a surgeon,
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.020]   you could move to another area of research.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.160]   Then you manage your risk
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.580]   by diversifying yourself personally.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.060]   If you are a pharmaceutical sales rep
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.260]   and you have an inside knowledge
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.720]   of investing in pharmaceutical companies,
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.980]   that can be leveraged to build wealth to a certain point.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.080]   But then at some point in time,
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.260]   you better get some of that money
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.060]   out of the pharmaceutical stocks
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.340]   and slide it aside into another area that's not connected.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.280]   Because if all of a sudden there is a giant scandal
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.980]   about pharmaceutical sales reps
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.020]   or pharmaceutical companies lying to the public
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.020]   and lying to the FDA about their research,
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.060]   well, the stocks drop and your job goes.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.160]   And now you're doomed.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.100]   So leverage it while you are building,
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.620]   but then diversify.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.940]   And I think that's an ebb and flow
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.640]   that can be maintained throughout life
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.100]   in an appropriate scale.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.380]   You've got to build a fortune.
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.420]   And if you've got time
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.860]   and you can afford to take some wipeout risk, go for it.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.740]   At this stage of my life,
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.860]   I'm pretty comfortable with some measure of wipeout risk.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.960]   That was why I launched Radical Personal Finance.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.580]   If this business blows up and falls apart,
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.420]   well, it'd be a bummer, but I've learned a lot.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.720]   I've built a diversity of contacts around the world.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.420]   I built a diversity and strengthened my own personal brand.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.360]   And so if this particular iteration
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.100]   of the business falls apart, it's no problem.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.300]   I can leverage that into multiple other related businesses.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.860]   So I'm willing to take the wipeout risk
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.980]   on this particular business
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.100]   because I'm diversified on the back end.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.780]   And realistically, I'm young enough.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.420]   I have enough other fallback skills.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.500]   I could go out and get a job
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.740]   in the financial planning business pretty easily
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.100]   and have a very healthy multiple six-figure income
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.420]   that would provide for the needs of my family.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.420]   But I'm also gonna manage the risk
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.140]   by not putting myself in a situation
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.880]   where it's gonna bring too much undue stress on my family
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.060]   where I run the risk of my kids not being fed
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.120]   or my wife being frustrated and leaving me.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.020]   So I've gotta manage it along the way.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.660]   You're gonna have to figure out what it is for you,
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.100]   but I think you can put both of these things together
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.020]   and use this as a creative journaling exercise.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.600]   On the one hand, look for how to become
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.820]   more and more specialized in your field
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.540]   because that's where the money comes every single time.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.900]   And then also ask yourself, what major risks do I face
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.420]   and how can I mitigate those risks?
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.260]   Be creative with the answer.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.260]   The answer might be an insurance policy.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.060]   It might be a savings account.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.220]   It might be a completely diversified
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.900]   and unrelated career fallback plan
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.220]   that you're building on the side.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.940]   But the thought process will lead you
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.060]   to identifying the opportunities and the risks for you.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.740]   Along the way, track the skills that you have
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.580]   and make sure that those skills
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.260]   are transitioned to something else.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.060]   To wrap up with a quick point on the initial question
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.460]   with something I think is very relevant.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.780]   If you're just managing multiple businesses,
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.260]   unless there's a common thread that you can identify,
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.420]   you're not gonna be good at any of them.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.320]   But if there is a common thread,
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.300]   you'll be able to leverage that common thread.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.180]   And that's what you should be looking for.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.820]   Not unrelated businesses, but diversified businesses
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.640]   where there's a common expertise of some sort.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.900]   That's it for today's show.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.340]   Thank you all for listening.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.200]   I hope this content is useful to you.

[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.420]   If you agree with something I said
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.260]   or disagree with something I said today,
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.300]   I'd be happy to hear from you.

[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.820]   If you have interesting articles to share,
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.100]   I don't mention this every day,
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.540]   but I do love to be proven wrong.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:44.220]   So I welcome you to show me where I'm wrong.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.060]   So that way I can learn
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.980]   and that way I can give better information.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.460]   So don't feel like this is the kind of show
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.500]   where your opinions are unwelcome.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.360]   I welcome them.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.640]   I learn from every single one of them.

[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.000]   We've also had some interesting discussions
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.660]   about this topic within our Facebook group,
