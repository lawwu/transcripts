[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   If you're going to go out in the morning, in the summer, you're going to get much brighter.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.280]   That's why I don't like the change in time.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.880]   I know people think, "Oh, because you're biased, you..."
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.880]   Because I think...
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.880]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.880]   Sorry.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.880]   The change in time, you're talking about daylight savings?
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.880]   Daylight saving.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.400]   It's such a bad idea because it disrupts that rhythm that you're having.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.040]   Because I think your body, if you keep that rhythm, you will see the whole seasonality.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.400]   And I look at it from a different aspect than other people.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.400]   It really...
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.440]   And people say, "I'm biased because I'm a morning person."
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.360]   And it may be true.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.120]   But there's a situation...
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.280]   Secret conspiracy about morning people.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.280]   But there is...
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.440]   If you think about it, Andrew, there is a situation where you're getting light perfectly
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.920]   well and then all of a sudden, they delay it by one hour because...
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.120]   And then, even though it's the summer, your body now, if you're still not adjusting, think,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.120]   "Oh, wait.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120]   What happened?
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.120]   What kind of happened?"
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.400]   I love that you're bringing this up because I always thought, what's the big deal?
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.400]   One hour.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.400]   Right?
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400]   One hour shift.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   Spring forward, fall back.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.880]   It's so hard to adjust to one hour.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.960]   But this goes back to the beginning of our discussion.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.520]   It's not just one hour.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   Right.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.400]   Because it's one hour across that one day.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.240]   But there's this cumulative effect on the clock and these three elements of your tripartite
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240]   model.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.240]   Right?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.160]   The homeostatic sleep and the direct effects on mood.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.560]   And when it's so close, it's sometimes hard to figure out how to adjust it perfectly.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.940]   Because we're already sleep-deprived in our society and then you shift it.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.600]   So it all accumulates and it has no benefit.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.440]   Well, you work at a major government organization, National Institute of Mental Health.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.720]   Why don't we campaign for- Honestly, I have no idea.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   I mean, it makes no sense.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.200]   No, I'm saying, why don't we go campaign for- Yeah, I would love to.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.560]   I mean, it makes no sense to have the summer light goes up at 9 p.m.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.040]   The light goes down where I live in Baltimore at 9 p.m.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.120]   And then all of a sudden, when you really want to see the light longer in the day, you
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.760]   now shift the other way.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.560]   And now it goes all of a sudden at 6 p.m.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.240]   Why do you do these drastic changes?
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.840]   Well, let it blend across the whole season.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.160]   You know, yes, later, earlier at night, but it's at least consistent.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.240]   It goes in a very consistent manner.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.280]   I just don't understand why they do this.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   It makes no sense.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.660]   Well, I think that the reason they do it is because they don't understand the biology.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.800]   Because one hour seems trivial unless you understand the repercussions of that one hour
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.840]   shift.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.120]   Because what's also clear now, based on what you're saying, is that that one hour shift
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.080]   is taking you out of alignment with the natural light-dark cycle in exactly the wrong direction.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.760]   It's pushing people to get even later.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.320]   In the summer, when light is going to push you later anyway, it doesn't make sense.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   You put it beautifully.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320]   I just rambled.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   No, no.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   You made it clear.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.160]   I mean, it's like literally it made people who are having problems having an advanced
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.440]   sleep rhythm because they are delayed.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.320]   Now you give them this hour to make them even more delayed.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   You push them even later in the day-night cycle.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.520]   It just doesn't make sense at all.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.880]   I think 2022 should be the year that we abolish daylight savings.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   Oh, man.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.680]   That would be the day for me, honestly.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.440]   Well, also if it has a positive effect on what is essentially an epidemic of mental
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.080]   health issues and other issues related to improper interactions with light, that, I
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.100]   think, is a well worthwhile cause and we can explore it.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.920]   So for once, we're going to fight with another group, a common battle, as opposed to with
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   one another.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.320]   I mean, the circadian people, honestly, to give them credit, have been trying for years
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.880]   to abolish daylight savings.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.840]   Yeah, the problem is they all go to sleep at 9 p.m. and wake up at 4 a.m. so we never
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   see them.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   That's right.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.120]   No, the circadian community has done an amazing job of figuring out what we need.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.960]   And then the challenge, of course, is making sure that people get what they need and making
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.200]   sure that at a societal level, we're not vaulting ourselves into the wrong direction.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.800]   The biggest problem is that the late waking people, they think that really, and I'm going
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.840]   to try to put it in a better way now, they think, "Oh, because you're a morning person,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.520]   you want to see the sun early, so you want me to suffer it dropping late."
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.660]   But that's not the case because what happens is when they shift it back after the daylight
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.480]   saving, now they're going to make you suffer really badly because now it's going to be
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   earlier.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   Right, in the fall.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.000]   In the fall when there's not enough light, if they keep it the same way.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.160]   So try to convince them that actually this at the end causes more trouble when you need
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.680]   the light for your late schedule in the fall when they shift it back.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.280]   Then they say, "Keep it daylight saving all the time."
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.440]   And that has been proven.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.920]   That is very bad.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.120]   Like people have done studies that literally two areas close to each other and areas that
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.920]   were the whole year on daylight saving has much more problems.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.760]   Even in cancer rates, in depression.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.280]   So you don't want to do that.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.840]   So that's what trying to convince people that you need to prevent that switch and you don't
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.200]   need daylight saving at all.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.040]   That's where the problem happens.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.040]   Interesting.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.640]   I had not thought about that, but yes, you late risers in the fall when you fall back,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.540]   as they say, spring forward, fall back, you dial back the clock.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.920]   It's really compounding the problem that already exists.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   Exactly.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.560]   And it's really nice if you keep it consistent.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.160]   In the spring, you get the equinox and then the days start going up.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.960]   And then even in the summer start going down, and then the fall, you get the other equinox
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   and go back.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.800]   So it's very symmetrical, right?
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.640]   It goes into short day, longer, long, long, long, then short day again.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.320]   But now you're getting these bumps in both sides of the spring and fall.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.620]   Why would you do that?
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.740]   Something that is beautifully symmetrical, beautifully smooth, you're putting bumps into
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.740]   it.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.260]   Well, and we are not just beautiful because it's there, but it, but evolved.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.180]   I mean, essentially this is the system we evolved in for hundreds of thousands of years.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.560]   Even apart from the exact equator, every part of the earth have seasonality.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   Right.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.620]   you
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.680]   you
