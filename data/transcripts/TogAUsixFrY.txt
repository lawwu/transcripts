[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.920]   - Here's a great question from a podcast listener
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.760]   named Nolan.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.400]   Pastor John, my name is Nolan from West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.120]   In First Thessalonians 411, Paul writes this.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.320]   "Make it your goal to live a quiet life,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.940]   "minding your own business and working with your hands
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.600]   "just as we instructed you before.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.860]   "Now, instantly I thought of faithful Christians
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.240]   "who led revolutions, Martin Luther,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.680]   "Martin Luther King Jr., et cetera.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.400]   "And noted that they did not live quiet lives
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.640]   "minding their own business."
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.560]   So my question is, does this passage prevent us
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.440]   from leading social movements,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.860]   many of which are bold and upfront,
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.080]   like the civil rights movement?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.640]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.160]   - Well, and of course, you don't have to jump over
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.680]   2000 years of church history to find examples
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.600]   of people who stirred up trouble almost everywhere he went.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.440]   - Right, exactly.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.080]   - Like in the New Testament,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.480]   the first thing we think of is Paul,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.720]   who wrote these words.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.440]   And the other person we think of is Jesus,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.240]   who never did anything wrong,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.240]   and both were accused of turning the world upside down.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880]   When they opened their mouths,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.800]   quietness did not follow.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.760]   Like division followed, riots followed,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.820]   murder followed.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.680]   So I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.200]   So, good question.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.080]   Just, you don't need Martin Luther or MLK to ask it,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.320]   although they're relevant,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.800]   and I'll come back to that, Lord willing.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.560]   We have Paul against Paul here,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.040]   and we have Jesus, who drove the money changers
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.120]   out of the temple, over against Jesus,
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.900]   who said, "Turn the other cheek."
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.080]   Of course, that's not the right way to put it.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.040]   Excuse me, Paul, sorry.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.440]   No, it is not Paul against Paul,
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.640]   and Jesus is not against Jesus.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.640]   The solution lies in finding how the pieces fit together
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.000]   in the Bible, not walking away from the table
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.680]   where the jigsaw puzzle is,
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.620]   lying there on the table, complaining,
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.480]   "Nothing fits, nothing fits."
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.600]   A lot of people leave God and the Bible that way.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.000]   They just see this, you know, 125 pieces spread out,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.080]   or maybe 1,000 people spread out on the table,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   and they can't find the one that fits next
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.160]   to make the picture beautiful,
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.400]   and they dump the table over because they're so angry,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.880]   and that's not good for them.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.120]   So let's read the text that Nolan is referring to,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.000]   very important, and I'm gonna put one other with it,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.320]   which I think sheds a lot of light on it.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.600]   So 1 Thessalonians 4, 9.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.000]   Concerning brotherly love,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.360]   you have no need for anyone to write you,
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.800]   for you yourselves have been taught by God
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.040]   to love one another,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.240]   for that indeed is what you are doing
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.440]   to all the brothers throughout Macedonia,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.160]   but we urge you to do it, brothers, more and more,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.000]   and to aspire to live quietly,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.120]   and to mind your own affairs,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.120]   now notice, quietly, and to mind your own affairs,
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.920]   2 Thessalonians is gonna spell that out
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920]   as meddling other people's business,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.760]   and to work with your hands as we instructed you,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.800]   so that you may walk properly before outsiders,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.160]   and not be dependent on anyone.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.800]   So what's the situation here?
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.840]   Some in the church seem to be idlers,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.300]   lazy, not working for a living,
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.480]   mooching off of others,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.120]   and bringing the church and the name of Jesus
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.880]   into disrepute among outsiders,
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.600]   and the quietness that Paul has in mind
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.240]   seems to be the opposite of bothersome talk
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.680]   when you hang around others who are trying to do their work,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.880]   and you aren't doing any work.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.880]   All you are is talk, so be quiet and get to work.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.200]   Pull your own economic weight,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.300]   and stop making Christianity look like
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.080]   the birthplace of laziness.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.440]   That's my paraphrase.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.640]   See if that's confirmed in 2 Thessalonians 3.10.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.540]   For even when we were with you,
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.080]   we would give you this command.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.000]   If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   For we hear that some among you are walking in idleness,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.520]   not busy at any work, but busy bodies,
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.080]   meddling in others' affairs.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.960]   Now, such persons we command and encourage
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   in the Lord Jesus to do their work quietly,
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.980]   and to earn their own living.
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.540]   So, the situation is exactly the same, I think.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.860]   I mean, same church,
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.580]   and these letters are not separated by very long.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.060]   There are lazy idlers in the church in Thessalonia,
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.180]   and maybe they're people who think the Lord
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.680]   is coming back so soon that they quit their jobs
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.580]   just to look up into the sky,
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.620]   and they're making an absolute nuisance of themselves
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.040]   as they idle around while other people
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.960]   are trying to do their work,
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.440]   and their mouths are filled with chatter
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.280]   and talk about what other people are doing
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.400]   rather than doing their own work.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   And he connects explicitly the quietness and the work.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.080]   Says, "We encourage in the Lord to do their work quietly."
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.800]   So, the quietness in mind is the opposite of,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   or it flows from focused, diligent, gainful employment.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.580]   If you're laying brick all day,
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.400]   or digging a ditch, or winnowing grain,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.180]   you're not a nuisance,
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.620]   gadding about and gossiping about other people
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.700]   while they're trying to work.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.740]   So, big question then, is it a contradiction
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.980]   when Paul walks into town,
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.260]   preaches the gospel, and a riot breaks out?
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.820]   He said, "Ooh, I shouldn't have done that.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.900]   "My goal is quietness."
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.820]   He clearly touched other people's affairs when he did that.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.180]   Like the silversmiths in Ephesus in Acts 19.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.140]   They were about to be put out of business
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.860]   by Paul's denouncing idolatry
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.820]   because these idols were made out of silver.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.780]   And so, if people renounce idolatry,
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.700]   the silversmiths are going out of business,
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.340]   and Paul is preaching the gospel anyway.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.460]   Is that a contradiction to 1 Thessalonians?
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.500]   And my answer is no, it's not a contradiction
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.460]   because Paul wasn't talking about that at all
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.940]   in 1 and 2 Thessalonians.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.620]   The overarching concern of Paul in Thessalonica
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.780]   was that the saints walk in love
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.220]   and that they exalt Christ truly in the community
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.900]   so that the outsiders see what he's really like.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.900]   And that's exactly what Paul was doing everywhere he went
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.000]   and what those who led great Christian movements were doing.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.740]   They were loving people and exalting Christ.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.460]   So, for us, let's do the same.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.660]   If it causes a public uproar,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.740]   let's make sure it's for love and for Christ.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.620]   Amen, thank you, Pastor John, for that balance.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.620]   It's all about Christ.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.700]   In fact, everything that does not make Christ
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.220]   look more glorious is a waste of our life,
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.580]   as Pastor John will explain tomorrow.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.420]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.500]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.540]   I'll see you tomorrow.
