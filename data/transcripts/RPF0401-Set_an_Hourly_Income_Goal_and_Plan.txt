[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.680]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.720]   the show dedicated to providing you with knowledge,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.520]   skills, insight, and encouragement.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.440]   You need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.360]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.900]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.700]   Yesterday we talked about goal setting for 2017.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.400]   Today we continue on that theme
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.200]   with a discussion of your wage.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.000]   Here's the deal.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500]   If you followed my advice, or if you're following my advice,
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.500]   very likely you are going to write down some income goals.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.100]   You're gonna write down an amount of money
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480]   that you want to make in the next year.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.140]   Great, it's a good place to start.
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.560]   Many people don't start there.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.140]   You'd be shocked at how few people have a goal
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.860]   for an amount of money that they wanna make.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.740]   Now, hopefully that income goal is tied to something else
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.240]   because income goals that are just round numbers
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.400]   are probably not gonna have the teeth
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.820]   required to get you through the hard times.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.080]   I know for me in years past when I would set an income goal
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.380]   that wasn't connected to something that mattered,
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.380]   beyond money, I've never hit one of 'em.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.680]   But if an income goal was connected to something
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.680]   that mattered to me, I've done pretty well.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.720]   So you set an income goal.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.920]   Well, that's great.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   So what's your next step?
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.420]   Do you sit around and hang out in your easy chair,
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.500]   close your eyes, and imagine that amount of money
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.680]   in your bank account?
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.140]   Well, I guess you can do that.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.720]   Some people do that.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.760]   But the next step that I'm gonna suggest you take
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.340]   is, I believe, far more effective
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.680]   than you're sitting around and imagining
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.720]   that amount of money in your bank account.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.020]   And that's to make a plan.
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.020]   You've gotta make an actual plan
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.480]   for how you are going to earn the income.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.140]   And in today's show, I'm gonna share with you
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.220]   how to make that plan, and it might surprise you
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.640]   because what you need to get to
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   is an actual hourly wage that you're going to earn.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.340]   Because you get paid when you work.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.340]   So you need to figure out how to transform
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.480]   your income goal into something tangible
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   that you can put onto your to-do list and do.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.600]   It's the topic of today's show.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.640]   Before we get into that,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.140]   couple of quick announcements for you.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.260]   Announcement number one, I think many of you
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.980]   will be very happy to hear, and that is this.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.140]   I am making major changes all around here
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.980]   at Radical Personal Finance in an effort
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.980]   to change my own personal business here
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.180]   to achieve my own personal goals
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.180]   and also to serve you effectively,
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.220]   because I'm only gonna be able to achieve my goals
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.440]   as I can serve you effectively.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.320]   And so one of those changes,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.100]   I'm announcing them little by little here and there
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.860]   over the next few weeks, but one of those major changes
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.740]   is that I am disconnecting
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.740]   our Radical Personal Finance Facebook group
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.520]   from patronage.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.280]   A major way that I focus on earning money from the show
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.480]   is through the use of the patron program
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.280]   that's set up on a website called Patreon,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.140]   which is a crowdfunding program
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.020]   where individual listeners of the show
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.980]   voluntarily go and sign up for it.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.060]   They go and sign up and say,
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.180]   hey, Josh, we like what you're doing,
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.680]   we like the content you're putting out,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.480]   so please, here's a few bucks
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.440]   just to support what you're doing.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.020]   And that's super, super helpful.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.600]   Right now, I have about 2,000 bucks a month
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.140]   coming in from that.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.640]   Now, one of the challenges I face with the Patreon program
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.020]   is figuring out how to actually set it up,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.440]   and there's been great successes with it
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.060]   and there's been major failures with it.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.520]   And one of the ideas that I had in the past
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.400]   was to make access to a Facebook group
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.060]   dependent upon patronage at a certain level.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.060]   A lot of reasons for that,
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.900]   I'll talk about that another time,
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.780]   probably when I talk more about Patreon.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.980]   I've still got to do some updates around there,
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.140]   but lots of reasons for that.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.740]   But at the moment, I am canceling that.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.480]   And what that means is that you can come and join
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.560]   the Radical Personal Finance Facebook community.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.400]   The idea is this, as you are working your way
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.780]   through your own personal planning process,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.200]   as you're working on building your knowledge
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   and your skills in order to live a rich life now,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.480]   while also working on your plan for financial freedom
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   in 10 years or less, which is the goal of that topic,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.400]   as you're doing that, I want to make sure
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.480]   that you have the ability to connect with other people
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.660]   who are like-minded.
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.320]   Now, there are many communities of people
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.200]   out there on the internet.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.940]   There is a very active Reddit financial independence boards
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.400]   where people are interacting on Reddit.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.280]   There are a few different forums,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.820]   the early retirement forums.
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.320]   For Jacob Lundfisker has his early retirement
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.900]   extreme forums.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.780]   Mr. Money Mustache forums on his websites are very active,
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.740]   and there are others as well, different forums.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.620]   I'm sure there are some Facebook groups,
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.400]   but I don't want to try to compete with any of those
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.100]   because Radical Personal Finance is a little bit unique.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.100]   I have a different approach than many other people do.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.480]   And so I'd like to provide for you a way to interact
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.900]   with other members of the audience
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.020]   in a way that's more interactive
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.140]   than commenting on the blog posts.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.280]   So oftentimes that comes down to either a forum
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.860]   or a Facebook group.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.140]   Now, forums have many unique advantages.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.640]   They also have significant disadvantages.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.480]   Probably my biggest beef with various forums
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.260]   is that they're simply difficult to use.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.140]   They're not particularly well integrated
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.320]   into the modern world.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.980]   Most forums have this antiquated look
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.540]   where they wind up with threads
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.100]   and many different posts and et cetera.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.560]   They're very non-multimedia friendly,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.980]   they're text only, et cetera.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.540]   And that, again, there are some major advantages to forums.
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.540]   There's huge advantages from someone like me
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.580]   as a content creator.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.260]   It's many, many pages of relevant content,
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.940]   which helps tremendously
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.220]   with the search engine optimization of my site
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.140]   and the findability.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.300]   That's one of the biggest benefits of forums.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.120]   It's also benefits that on a forum,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.580]   you can have a good deal of anonymity.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.460]   You can just simply join with a username.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.620]   You don't have to give out your personal name.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.900]   That can help people to feel very comfortable
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.420]   doing things like publishing personal financial data.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.500]   Many people you'll see in personal finance forums
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.940]   do things like maintain a public journal
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.140]   of their personal finance progress,
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.900]   what they made, what they spend.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.780]   And they can do that
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.260]   because there's some level of anonymity granted
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.500]   by the simple username from a forum.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.880]   I think that's great.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.760]   At the moment, I don't wanna manage and moderate a forum.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.320]   And the biggest downside of a forum,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.640]   my opinion is simply it's not user-friendly.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.880]   There's not really any good phone software.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.400]   Most forums integrate with an app called Tap a Talk.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.420]   If you are a user of forums,
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.440]   you probably have tried that app.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.200]   I find it clunky and non-useful.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.800]   And the Facebook is fantastic.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.840]   Facebook app is great.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.380]   And the Facebook even has its own standalone groups app.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.200]   So I've decided to just stay on the Facebook platform
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.000]   using the Facebook Radical Personal Finance group.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.840]   So again, up till now, that group was behind,
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.920]   it was only available to patrons.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.720]   And so the link was a little bit hidden.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.160]   I didn't advertise it here on the show.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.680]   At this point in time, I'm opening it up.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.000]   And I'm inviting any of you who would like to participate
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.120]   in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook community
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.920]   to come and to join the Facebook group.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.080]   The Facebook group is a really great place
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.240]   for you to build some relationships
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.320]   and build some friendships
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.960]   with some of your fellow listeners,
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.240]   people who might enjoy similar things like you.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.000]   I know many of these relationships
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.180]   that have happened throughout
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.460]   the Radical Personal Finance community,
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.800]   some of them have led to in-person relationships.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.520]   I'm aware of a number of community members
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.040]   who've built friendships based upon first getting connected
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.040]   through the Radical Personal Finance community.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.700]   So that Facebook group is now open
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.320]   to any of you who would like to join.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.560]   And I hope that many of you will.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.300]   Again, with it being right on your phone, it's fantastic.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.200]   It's right there where you are anyway.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.720]   And I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.520]   It's easy, good multimedia integration.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.360]   You can share pictures,
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.800]   you can share all the normal Facebook stuff, videos.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.640]   I'll be doing some stuff in there, trying to keep it good.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.980]   I'll be involved in there to some extent,
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.840]   to some extent that I'm able.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.320]   But it's a really, really great resource for you.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.720]   And I want you to use that resource.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.440]   If you'd like to ask questions of other people,
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.920]   there are some really smart people
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.640]   already in that Facebook group.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.900]   And I think there'll be even more smart people here now.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.740]   In a multitude of counsel, there's great wisdom.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.500]   That's what the Bible teaches, one of the Proverbs.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.460]   And so you should always seek out as much input
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.820]   and as much diverse counsel as you can find on a question.
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.060]   The full quote of that Proverb is this,
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.300]   "Without counsel, plans fail,
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.380]   "but with many advisors, they succeed."
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.940]   And so it's always useful to gain from other people
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.220]   who've been in different situations,
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.700]   who've been in similar situations,
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.740]   who can help provide insight into your situation.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.060]   So come on over to Facebook
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.900]   and search for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.500]   Remember that there's a Radical Personal Finance
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.620]   Facebook page, and then there's
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.220]   Radical Personal Finance now Facebook group.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.020]   So the page you like, the group you request to join,
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.120]   and I will approve you to join that.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.580]   One little tip for those of you
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.860]   who are properly wary of social media.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.740]   I think there are tremendous dangers in social media,
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.320]   tremendous dangers from a lack of privacy.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.280]   I just think they're tremendous dangers.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.820]   If I were not running Radical Personal Finance
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.140]   at this point in time, I don't think I would have
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.380]   any social media accounts because they are so invasive
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.500]   from the perspective of privacy
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.500]   and they're incredibly invasive to your life.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.620]   They add some, something to some people,
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.500]   but even just, you look at some of the data
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.580]   on social media use and social media use
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.700]   and its impact on depression, levels of dissatisfaction,
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.220]   you have to be very careful being an excessive consumer
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.620]   of social media because what you are seeing
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.020]   is a very carefully curated image
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.800]   that somebody wants you to gain.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.820]   We only post the positive stuff about us
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.980]   and that will lead you to the assumption
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.900]   that everybody else's life is just great.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.880]   That's where, you know, sometimes I feel bad
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.900]   about how many of the negative things I tell you
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.140]   about my own personal challenges here on the show,
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.260]   but I do it because I want to break
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.180]   some of these misconceptions.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.800]   I want you to understand that no matter who you are,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.740]   if you respect me and look up to me in some way,
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.860]   it ain't easy.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.240]   There are very difficult times, there are difficult days.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.180]   We all fail, we all make mistakes.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.960]   And so I try to do that, but even me, just like we all do,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.640]   I curate the things that I share.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.580]   I share the happy pictures.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.020]   I post when I'm feeling exuberant about something.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.940]   I don't post a note on Facebook and say this.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.940]   So I think the benefit of social media is mixed.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.460]   There are significant benefits and significant challenges.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.620]   On the net, I think it's a win, but I think,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.620]   anyway, be careful.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.060]   Point of that was to say that if you want to participate
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.380]   in something like the Radical Personal Finance Group,
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.780]   but you don't have a Facebook profile, set up a fake one.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.300]   I strongly encourage you to do that
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.700]   because there's a lot of great info in Facebook communities
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.100]   where even if you don't want to have a personal profile,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.860]   you can go in and set up a fake profile.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.420]   Now, Facebook will require you to use a real name.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.260]   So you are welcome to be either John Smith or Susie Smith,
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.140]   and you can post any kind of picture that you want.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.940]   The only requirement is that you have to post something
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.380]   that sounds like a name,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.620]   but you can call yourself anything that you want to be.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.340]   So Susan Jones, John Smith works great,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.500]   or whatever version of that you want to be.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.220]   And that allows you to interact with other people,
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.500]   but still retain some degree of your privacy.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.780]   So my hope is that by giving you that advice,
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.300]   we can mollify some of the concerns
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.900]   about the lack of privacy with a Facebook group
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.620]   as compared to a forum.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.580]   And I hope it will be a great resource to you.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.900]   So come on by facebook.com or search on your phone,
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.740]   Radical Personal Finance.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.540]   It's a group and request to join,
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.200]   and I will approve you for that.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.220]   Those are enough of my announcements
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.300]   on that topic for today.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.140]   Let's get to it.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.140]   With regard to Patreon,
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.060]   we'll talk about Patreon more another day,
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.540]   but for today, I would just welcome you,
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.540]   if you find value in this show,
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.180]   take a couple bucks a month and sign up as a patron.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.180]   That's hugely influential to me as a creator of this project.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.980]   You can find those details
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.740]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.620]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.980]   Now, your hourly wage.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.100]   Here's the simple gist.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.980]   In our world, in a capitalistic economy,
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.260]   you get paid what you're worth.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.220]   So in order for you to get paid more,
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.420]   you have to become worth more.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.700]   It's as simple as that.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.060]   You say, well, I'm not getting paid what I'm worth.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.980]   Well, don't worry.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.860]   You probably are, but if you're not,
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.060]   somebody along will come along and pay you what you're worth.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.220]   That's how it works.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.940]   If you're working a job and you're getting paid $10 an hour,
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.460]   but you're worth $20 an hour,
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.580]   one of your customers or a friend or a coworker will come
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.980]   and they will steal you away.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.340]   Or you can go out into the job market
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.180]   and go get yourself a job.
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.260]   So just for today, even if you disagree with me,
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.060]   just stick with the concept.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.300]   You get paid what you're worth.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.660]   So if you want to get paid more,
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.260]   you've got to become worth more.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.260]   Well, what do you have to contribute to the world?
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:16.940]   For most of you, it's primarily your human capital,
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.740]   your time and your energy.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.740]   Whatever you do, you're going to be paid more.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.740]   Whatever you can actually do,
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.940]   that's what you have to contribute.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.900]   Your contributions are largely,
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.980]   for most of you, going to be related to your time.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.300]   And so if you want to figure out
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.260]   how you're going to hit that income goal,
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.780]   you need to figure out what you're going to do
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.860]   with your time.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.540]   We all have the same 24 hours a day,
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.540]   the same 168 hours a week.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.220]   So it's what you do with those 168 hours a week
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.660]   that will determine your results.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.020]   Some people make a few pennies a day.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.060]   Some people make millions in a day.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.180]   And it's all based upon what you do
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.100]   with your 168 hours a week.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.620]   So to get some clarity around this,
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.580]   let me give you an example.
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.460]   Let's say that you set yourself a very excellent goal,
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.780]   which is to earn a six-figure income in 2017.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.940]   You have a goal of earning $100,000 in 2017.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.020]   That's a great goal.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.940]   That will put you at about double the median wage
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.820]   in the United States of America.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.820]   And that'll move you into a great,
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.940]   that's a great goal, good round goal.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.940]   Set that goal, $100,000.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.580]   Well, what do you actually need to do per hour
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.380]   in order to earn $100,000?
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.980]   First thing you got to do is you got to ask,
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.780]   is it $100,000 gross or $100,000 net?
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.220]   Is it $100,000 pre-tax or is it $100 post-tax?
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.660]   Always a big question.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.900]   For today, let's just assume you actually wanna have
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.900]   $100,000 to spend, which is how most people actually mean it.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.740]   That means you're gonna earn, you're gonna need to earn,
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.740]   let's say you're gonna pay about a 25% tax rate, $125,000.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.820]   Always calculate that in.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.780]   Now, if you have a more specific knowledge
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.980]   of your tax rate, great.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.420]   But for now, let's just say 25% of income tax.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.780]   You're gonna earn $100,000.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.580]   That means you actually have to earn $125,000
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.100]   to net $100,000 to spend.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.380]   Next, you calculate and ask,
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.000]   how many hours are you willing to work per week?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.780]   Let's say that number is 40.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.300]   Standard 40-hour work week.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.820]   You say, I'll work 40 hours a week.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.140]   And then the next question is,
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.060]   how many weeks will you work per year?
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.700]   Let's say that's 50.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.460]   52 weeks in a year, you take two weeks off for vacation.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.660]   Now you've gotta work 50 weeks per year.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.080]   That means that in a year, you will work 2,000 hours.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.580]   40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year is 2,000 hours.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.940]   So if you take the number that you need to actually earn,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:06.940]   which is $125,000, in order to net $100,000,
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:12.600]   you need to produce at least $62.50 of value
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.660]   per hour that you work.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.340]   Every single hour in a 40-hour work week,
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.660]   every single week for 50 weeks out of the year.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.600]   $62.50.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.340]   Now if we were just saying $100,000 gross,
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.900]   and you weren't accounting for the 25% of tax,
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.580]   the number would be $50 an hour.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.820]   The people who are gonna earn $100,000
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.820]   are those who produce at least $50 per hour of value.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.140]   $50 per hour of value.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:52.380]   So if you are not earning $100,000,
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:58.400]   it's good to set a goal of earn $100,000.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.940]   But you gotta go on to the next step and say,
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.940]   how can I produce at least $62.50 worth an hour of value?
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.040]   $62.50 worth an hour of value.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.580]   And this concept is applicable
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.960]   whether or not you're an hourly employee,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.020]   whether you're a salaried employee,
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.780]   whether you're a business owner,
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.380]   whether you're a professional, doesn't matter.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:29.300]   The point is that you need to produce value at this rate.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.300]   So when you go into work on Monday morning,
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.860]   and you're sitting there, and as many times I do,
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.900]   and you're sitting in front of the computer,
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.560]   and you have the temptation to say,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.980]   well, let me open that time-wasting website,
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.740]   all of a sudden, that's gonna make it much harder
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.380]   for you to earn your $50 an hour,
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.860]   or your $62 an hour.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:55.980]   Now let's say you wanna earn $100,000,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.060]   but you don't wanna work 40 hours a week.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.380]   Well, you can put in any number that you want.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.180]   Let's say you wanna work 30 hours a week.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.460]   And let's say instead of working 50 hours,
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.000]   excuse me, 50 weeks per year,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.580]   you wanna work 40 weeks per year.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.740]   Well, if you wanna earn $100,000,
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.700]   you need to produce $104.17 per,
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.120]   you know, I'm gonna, hold on a second.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.400]   Built this little calculator,
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.020]   a little spreadsheet real quick on Google Sheets
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.800]   that I'm gonna share in the notes
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.660]   so you can go and put your own hours in.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.820]   But I built it with this tax rate built in.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.120]   It's too confusing to talk about the taxes.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.440]   We're gonna skip taxes for a moment.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.560]   And from now on, we're just gonna use just the number,
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.480]   gross income, $100,000.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.040]   So if you wanna earn $100,000 per year
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.880]   and you're willing to work 30 hours per week
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   for 40 weeks a year,
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.800]   now you need to produce $83.33 per hour of work.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.480]   It's as simple as that.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.920]   So you need to apply this just like I need to apply this.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.080]   This is something that I am applying
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.120]   as I consider my 2017 financial goals
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.560]   and I put in my numbers of what I wanna earn
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.220]   because my numbers are connected,
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.320]   not to a big round number,
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.080]   none of anyone else's business what that number is.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.260]   I don't plan to tell anybody.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.120]   My numbers are connected to specific goals,
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.360]   specific level of lifestyle
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.760]   that I wanna make for my family,
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.380]   specific amounts that I wanna earn
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.120]   for certain consumption goals, certain investment goals.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.240]   As I put that number in there
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.680]   and then I think through how many hours I wanna work,
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.360]   how many weeks per year,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.680]   it gives me a sobering reality.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.120]   Let's just make an example.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.920]   Let's pretend that I wanna earn $250,000.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.200]   Let's ignore taxes.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.000]   And let's say that I'm willing to work 40 hours per week
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.680]   and I'm willing to work 40 weeks per year.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.080]   One of my personal goals, I'm not there yet,
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.200]   but in the future, I don't know if,
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.120]   it's not gonna be 2017.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.080]   I'm not making this plan in 2017,
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.200]   but maybe 2018 I'll be in a position
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.680]   where I'm ready to go ahead and do it.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.040]   But I wanna work three months at a time.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.920]   Work three months, take a month off.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.240]   I wanna work January, February, and March,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.760]   and I wanna take April off.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.680]   I wanna work May, June, and July, I wanna take August off.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.280]   I wanna work September, October, November,
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.540]   take December off.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.640]   That's been for years a dream of mine.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.100]   And I've taken a month off at various times,
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.280]   but I haven't gotten to the point
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.360]   where I've been able to have everything
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.720]   running smoothly enough
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.120]   that I could actually follow through with that.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.400]   But that's a goal of mine.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.040]   So that means that I need to plan
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.640]   on about a 39-week work week under that schedule.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.920]   It comes out to about 39 weeks.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.480]   Well, let's say I wanna earn $250,000.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.600]   I'm willing to work 40 hours per week
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.240]   for 39 weeks per year.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.080]   That leaves me with 1,560 hours per year to work.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.000]   That means I need to produce for every hour I work
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.880]   at least $160 per hour of value.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   $160 per hour of value every single hour.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.360]   That ain't easy.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.960]   It's not easy for any of us.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:15.000]   The reason it's not easy is not
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.720]   because it's hard to earn $160 hourly wage.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.520]   It's very doable to earn $160 an hour hourly wage.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.720]   That's a, I mean, I don't have the data
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.520]   for someone like a billable rate
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.560]   for an entry-level attorney,
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.760]   but I wouldn't be surprised if $150, $200 an hour
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.400]   is a current rate there.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.840]   You get up into an expert attorney
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.400]   and your billable rate turns into 500,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.200]   1,000 to plus dollars an hour.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.360]   So it's not hard to do that.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.080]   What is hard to do is to do that 40 hours a week
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.760]   for 39 weeks of the year.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.080]   It's the consistency.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.480]   See, all of us have some things that we can do
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.600]   that produce at a very high level.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:02.280]   And the higher you go in the income scale,
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.000]   the more likely it is that your income
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.360]   is not actually so consistently punched out.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.840]   Meaning you're not just getting paid
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.360]   on a strict hourly rate.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.240]   Rather, you're getting paid for projects.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.640]   You're getting paid for bursts
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.200]   of very high output productivity at very high rates.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.640]   You're getting paid in bursts for work,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   doing work that's $1,000 an hour work
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.320]   for these 20 hours here,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.960]   and then the next couple weeks just simply
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.320]   trimming up the pieces, et cetera.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.880]   But the way you move up the income scale
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.840]   is by constantly having this in the back of your mind.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.280]   If I'm gonna be at work, I need to work.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   And I'm going to produce at a high hourly rate.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.440]   Action step for today.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.440]   Calculate your hourly rate that you need to produce
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.360]   based upon your numbers.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.920]   Figure out your income goal.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.360]   Take that income goal.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.080]   I'm gonna link a quick little Google sheet.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.040]   I think it'll work for you.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.760]   I've frozen two of the cells so that you can,
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.120]   I'm gonna simplify it, pull out this tax line
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.960]   just so it's simple.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.600]   I've frozen just the result cell.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.760]   You can go in and you can change the numbers.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.920]   That should work for you.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.700]   I don't think there'll be a big problem.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.140]   So I'll link that in the notes for today.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.080]   But go in and put your number of how much you wanna earn.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.100]   Go in and put in how many hours per week
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.060]   you're willing to work.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.240]   Put in how many weeks per year.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.560]   Now here's the magic of this.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.620]   Let's say that you wanted to earn $100,000,
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.520]   but you're not earning at a high hourly rate yet.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.320]   Well, that's okay.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.280]   Go ahead and put in 60 hours per week
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.320]   and put in that you're willing to work 50 weeks a year.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.440]   Or 50 weeks a year.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.940]   If you're willing to work 60 hours a week
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.580]   for 50 weeks a year, you only need to earn $33.33 per hour
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.580]   in order to produce $100,000.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.680]   So you can do this no matter what your numbers are,
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.220]   but go in there with your actual numbers.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.540]   And remember, if you wanna produce big numbers
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.540]   on the income side, it's gonna come down to consistent,
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:15.260]   highly productive, focused, high value work.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   That's how you earn your money.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:30.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
