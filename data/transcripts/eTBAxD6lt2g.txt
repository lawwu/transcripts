[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   Listen, when it comes to romantic relationships,
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.080]   if it's not 100% in you, it ain't happening.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.260]   And I've never seen a violation of that statement
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.340]   where it's like, yeah, it's mostly good,
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.800]   and there's this, and there's like the negotiations.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.400]   Well, already it's doomed.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.800]   And that doesn't mean someone has to be perfect,
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.020]   the relationship has to be perfect,
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.800]   but it's got to feel 100% inside,
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.440]   like yes, yes, and yes.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.480]   The following is a conversation with my dear friend,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.920]   Andrew Huberman, his fourth time on this podcast.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.100]   It's my birthday,
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.040]   so this is a special birthday episode of sorts.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.200]   Andrew flew down to Austin just to wish me a happy birthday,
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.880]   and we decided to do a podcast last second.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.160]   We literally talked for hours beforehand,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.400]   and a long time after, late into the night,
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.440]   he's one of my favorite human beings,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.160]   brilliant scientist, incredible teacher, and a loyal friend.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.240]   I'm grateful for Andrew, I'm grateful for good friends,
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.120]   for all the support and love I've gotten
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.440]   over the past few years.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.000]   I'm truly grateful for this life,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.320]   for the years, the days, the minutes, the seconds
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.800]   I've gotten to live on this beautiful earth of ours.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800]   I really don't want to leave just yet.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.300]   I think I'd really like to stick around.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.760]   I love you all.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.300]   and now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.560]   - Trying to run a little bit more.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.600]   - Are you losing weight?
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.540]   - I'm not trying to lose weight,
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.200]   but I always do the same fitness routine.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.400]   I have for like 30 years, basically,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760]   lift three days a week, run three days a week.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   But one of the runs is a long run,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.920]   one of them's medium, one of them's a sprint type thing.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.180]   So what I've decided to do this year
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.600]   was just extend the duration of the long run,
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   and I like being mobile.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.680]   I never want to be so heavy that I can't move.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.400]   Like I want to be able to go out
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.640]   and run 10 miles if I have to, so sometimes I do.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.600]   And I want to be able to sprint if I have to,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.720]   so sometimes I do.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.760]   And lifting in objects feels good.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.960]   It feels good to train like a lazy bear
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.920]   and just lift heavy objects,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.040]   but I've also started training
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.240]   with lighter weights and higher repetitions
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.840]   for three-month cycles,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.600]   and it gives your joints a rest.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.240]   And yeah, so I probably, you know,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.600]   I think it also is interesting to see
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.620]   how training differently changes your cognition.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.920]   That's probably hormone related,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.100]   you know, hormones downstream of training heavy
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.760]   versus hormones downstream of training a little bit lighter.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.880]   I think my cognition is better when I'm doing more cardio
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.080]   and when the repetition ranges are a little bit higher,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.280]   which is not to say that people who lift heavy are dumb,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.440]   but there is a,
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.200]   'cause there's real value in lifting heavy.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.240]   - There's a lot of angry people listening to this right now.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.280]   - No, no, no, but lifting heavy
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.300]   and then taking three to five minutes rest
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.360]   is far and away a different challenge
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.640]   than running hard for 90 minutes.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.560]   That's a tough thing.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.640]   Just like getting in an ice bath,
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   people say, "Oh, well, how is that any different
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.040]   "than working out?"
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.040]   Well, there are a lot of differences,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.680]   but one of them is that it's very acute stress.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.000]   Within one second, you're stressed.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.880]   So I think subjecting the body to a bunch of different types
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.020]   of stressors in space and time is really valuable.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.600]   So yeah, I've been playing with the variables
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.880]   in a pretty systematic way.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   - Well, I like long and slow for, like you said,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.760]   the impact it has on my cognition.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.440]   - Yeah, the wordlessness of it,
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.760]   the way it puts you in a,
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   the way it seems to clean out the clutter,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.480]   it can take away that hyper-focus
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.800]   and put you more in a relaxed focus for sure.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.000]   - Well, for me, it brings the clutter
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.680]   to the surface at first.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.520]   Like all these thoughts come in there
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.880]   and then they dissipate.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.520]   You know, I've been, 'cause I got knee barred pretty hard.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.120]   That's when somebody tries to break your knee.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.240]   - That was just, what's a knee bar?
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.480]   They try and break your knee?
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.520]   - Yeah. - Oh, so you tap.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.800]   So they-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   So it's, you know, hyper-extending you that direction.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.240]   I got knee barred pretty hard.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.760]   So in ways I don't understand, it kind of hurts to run.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.680]   I don't understand what's happening behind there.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   I need to investigate this.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.840]   It basically, the hamstring flex,
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.320]   like curling your leg hurts a little bit.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.840]   And that results in this weird, dull,
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.400]   but sometimes extremely sharp pain in the back of the knee.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.440]   So I'm working through this.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.240]   Anyway, but walking doesn't hurt.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.240]   So I've been playing around with walking recently,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   like for two hours and thinking.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   'Cause I know a lot of smart people throughout history
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.800]   have walked and thought.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.000]   And you have to play with things
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.040]   that have worked for others, not just to exercise,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   but to integrate this very light kind of prolonged exercise
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.960]   into a productive life.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.920]   So they do all their thinking while they walk.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.160]   It's like a meditative type of walking.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.560]   And it's really interesting.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.920]   It really works.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.640]   - Yeah, the practice I've been doing a lot more of lately
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.400]   is I walk while reading a book.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.000]   In the yard, I'll just pace back and forth
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.160]   or walk in a circle.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.000]   - Audiobook or you talking about-
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.680]   - No, hard copy.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.520]   - Where you just holding-
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.280]   - I'm holding the book and I'm walking and I'm reading.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.080]   Yeah, and I usually have a pen and I'm underlining.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.480]   I have this whole system like underlining stars,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.120]   exclamation points, goes back to university
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.160]   of what things I will go back to,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.060]   which things I export to notes and that kind of thing.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.280]   But from the beginning, when I opened my lab
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   at that time in San Diego, before I moved back to Stanford,
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.480]   I would have meetings with my students or postdocs
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.160]   by just walking in the field behind the lab.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.800]   And I'd bring my bulldog Costello,
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.960]   bulldog mastiff at the time.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.600]   And he was a slow walker.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.520]   So these were slow walks,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.680]   but I can think much more clearly that way.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.400]   There's a Nobel prize winning professor
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.120]   at Columbia University School of Medicine, Richard Axel,
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.400]   won the Nobel prize, co-won Nobel prize with Linda Buck
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.480]   for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.240]   And he walks in voice dictates his papers.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.000]   And now with Rev or these other,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.120]   maybe there are better ones than Rev
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.200]   where you can convert audio files into text very quickly
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.300]   and then edit from there.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.960]   So I will often voice dictate first drafts
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.180]   and things like that.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.480]   And I totally agree on the long runs, the walks,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.240]   the integrating that with cognitive work,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.520]   harder to do a sprints.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   And then the gym, you know, are you weight train?
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.160]   You just seem naturally strong and like thicker jointed.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.000]   It's true.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.560]   I mean, we did the one very beginner
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.720]   'cause I'm a very beginner of jujitsu class together.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.280]   And yeah, as I mentioned then, what if people missed it?
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.360]   Lex is freakishly strong.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.080]   - I think I was born genetically to hug people.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.640]   - Oh, like Costello.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.480]   - Exactly.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.920]   - You guys have a certain similarity.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.440]   He had wrists like, you know,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.160]   it's like you and Jocko and Costello
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.120]   have these like wrists and elbows that are super thick,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.480]   you know, and then you look around
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.640]   and you see tremendous variation.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.440]   Some people will have like the wrist width of a Whippet
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.800]   or Woody Allen, and then other people like you or Jocko,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.960]   or, you know, there's this one Jocko video
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.320]   or thing on GQ or something.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.680]   Have you seen the comments on Jocko?
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.800]   These are the best.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.760]   - No.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.040]   - The comments, I love the comments on YouTube
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.160]   'cause occasionally they're funny.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.960]   The best is when Jocko was born,
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.520]   the doctor looked at his parents and said, "It's a man."
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.400]   [laughing]
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.720]   - It's like Chuck Norris type comments.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.160]   - Oh yeah, those are great.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.240]   That's what I miss about Rogan being on YouTube
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.680]   with the full length episodes, is all that comment.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   - So this is technically a birthday podcast.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.800]   What do you love most about getting older?
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:55.780]   - It's like the confirmation that comes from getting more
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.960]   and more data, which basically says,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.800]   yeah, the first time you thought that thing,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.640]   it was actually right
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.600]   because the second, third, and fourth, and fifth time,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.880]   it turned out the exact same way.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.340]   In other words, there've been a few times in my life
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.340]   where I did not feel easy about something.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.180]   I felt a signal from my body, this is not good.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.280]   And I didn't trust it early on, but I knew it was there.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   And then two or three bad experiences later,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.040]   I'm able to say, ah, every single time,
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.140]   there was a signal from the body informing my mind,
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.600]   this is not good.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.200]   Now, the reverse has also been true
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.880]   that there've been a number of instances
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.160]   in which I feel sort of immediate delight.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.480]   And there's this kind of almost astonishingly
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.400]   simple experience of feeling comfortable with somebody
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   or at peace with something or delighted at an experience.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.700]   And it turns out all, literally all of those experiences
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.800]   and people turned out to be experiences
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.720]   and people that are still in my life
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.440]   and that I still delight in every day.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.380]   In other words, what's great about getting older
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.380]   is that you stop questioning the signals
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.080]   that come from the, I think, deeper recesses
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.120]   of your nervous system to say, hey, this is not good,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.280]   or hey, this is great, more of this.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   Whereas I think in my teens, my 20s, my 30s,
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.380]   I'm almost 48, I'll be 48 next month.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.880]   I didn't trust, I didn't listen.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.720]   I actually put a lot of work into overriding those signals
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.800]   and learning to fight through them,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.840]   thinking that somehow that was making me tougher
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.960]   or somehow that was making me smarter,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.600]   when in fact, in the end, those people that you meet
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.280]   that are difficult or there are other names for it,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.800]   it's like, in the end, you're like,
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.440]   yeah, that person's a piece of shit.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   Or this person is amazing and they're really wonderful,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.720]   and I felt that from go.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.960]   - So you've learned to trust your gut
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.040]   versus the influences of other people's opinions.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.000]   - I've learned to trust my gut
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   versus the forebrain overanalysis, overriding the gut.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.980]   Other people often in my life have had great optics.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.080]   I've benefited tremendously from an early age
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.560]   of being in a large community
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.640]   of what has been mostly guys,
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.780]   but I have some close female friends
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.020]   and always have as well,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.360]   who will tell me that that's a bad decision
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.960]   or this person not so good or be careful
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.400]   or they're great or that's great.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.640]   So oftentimes my community and the people around me
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.480]   have been more aligned with the correct choice than not.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.600]   - Really? - Yes.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.840]   - Really, when you were younger,
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.280]   like with like trans parents and so on?
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.800]   - I don't recall ever really listening
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.200]   to my parents that much.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.400]   I grew up in a, you know,
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.120]   we don't have to go back to my childhood thing,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   but my sense was that- - It's not your fault, Andrew.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.940]   - Thank you.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.300]   I learned that recently in a psilocybin journey.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.040]   My first high dose psilocybin journey, which was-
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.880]   - Welcome back.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.360]   - Done with a clinician, thank you very much.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.200]   Thank you.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.280]   I was worried there for a second at one point,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.740]   am I not coming back?
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.320]   But in any event, yeah, I grew up with some wild kids.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.000]   You know, I would say about a third of my friends
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.800]   from childhood are dead or in jail.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.360]   About a third have gone on
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.520]   to do tremendously impressive things,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.420]   start companies, excellent athletes,
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.400]   academics, scientists, and clinicians.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.180]   And then about a third are living their lives
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.600]   as kind of more typical.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.840]   I just mean that they are happy family people
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.400]   with jobs that they mainly serve the function to make money.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.480]   They're not sort of career,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.960]   into their career for career's sake.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   But, so some of my friends early on
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.520]   gave me some bad ideas.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.120]   But most of the time my bad ideas came from
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.880]   overriding the signals that I knew that my body,
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.880]   and I would say my body and brain were telling me to obey.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.920]   And when I say body and brain is that
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.840]   there's this brain region, the insula,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.460]   which does many things,
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.040]   but it represents our sense of internal sensation
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.240]   and interoception.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.600]   And I was talking to Paul Conti about this,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.960]   as who, as you know, I respect tremendously.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.560]   I think he's one of the smartest people I've ever met.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.620]   I think for different reasons,
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.840]   he and Mark Andreessen are some of the like
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.560]   smartest people I've ever met.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.920]   But Paul's level of insight into the human psyche
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.480]   is absolutely astounding.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.640]   And he says the opposite of what most people say
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.520]   about the brain, which is most people say,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.760]   oh, the supercomputer of the brain is the forebrain.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.000]   It's like a monkey brain with a extra real estate
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.840]   put on there.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.600]   And the forebrain is what makes us human
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.360]   and gives us our superpowers.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.600]   Paul has said, and he's done a whole series
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.800]   on mental health that's coming out
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.960]   from our podcast in September.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.300]   So this is not an attempt to plug that,
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.160]   but he'll elaborate on what I'm about to say.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.360]   - Wait, you're doing a thing with Paul?
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.200]   - We already did.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.440]   - Oh, nice.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.000]   - Yeah, so Paul Conti shot up,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.040]   we did, he and I sat down,
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.560]   he did a four episode series on mental health.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.760]   It's not mental illness, mental health,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.920]   about how to explore one's own subconscious,
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:26.900]   explore the self, build and cultivate the generative drive.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.880]   You'll learn more about what that is from him.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.740]   He's far more eloquent and clear than I am.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.080]   And he provides essentially a set of steps
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.680]   to explore the self that does not require
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.720]   that you work with a therapist.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.160]   This is self-exploration that is rooted in psychiatry.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.420]   It's rooted in neuroscience.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.280]   And I don't think this information exists anywhere else.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.240]   I'm not aware that it exists anywhere else.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.600]   And he essentially distills it all down
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.640]   to one eight and a half by 11 sheet,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.400]   which we provide for people.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.160]   And he says there, I don't want to give too much away
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.840]   because I would detract from what he does so beautifully,
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.640]   but if I tried and I wouldn't accomplish it in any way,
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.660]   but he said, and I believe that the subconscious
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.000]   is the supercomputer of the brain.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.580]   All the stuff working underneath our conscious awareness
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.400]   that's driving our feelings and what we think
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.520]   are the decisions that we've thought through so carefully.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   And that only by exploring the subconscious
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.820]   and understanding it a little bit,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.240]   can we actually improve ourselves over time.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   And I agree.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.440]   I think that so that the mistake is to think
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   that thinking can override it all.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.740]   It's a certain style of introspection and thinking
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.260]   that allows us to read the signals from our body,
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.300]   read the signals from our brain,
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.900]   integrate the knowledge that we're collecting
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.500]   about ourselves and to use all that in ways
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.420]   that are really adaptive and generative for us.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.800]   - What do you think is there in that subconscious?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.580]   What do you think of the Jungian shadow?
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.060]   What's there?
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.380]   - You know, there's this idea as you're familiar with too,
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.900]   I'm sure that this Jungian idea
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.820]   that we all have all things inside of us,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.880]   that all of us have the capacity to be evil,
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.840]   to be good, et cetera,
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.160]   but that some people express one or the other
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.520]   to greater extent.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.940]   But he also mentioned that there's a unique category
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.480]   of people, maybe two to 5% of people
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.800]   that don't just have all things inside of them,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.080]   but they actually spend a lot of time exploring
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.520]   a lot of those things, the darker recesses,
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.340]   the shadows, their own shadows.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.660]   You know, I'm somebody who's drawn to goodness
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.720]   and to light and to joy and all those things
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.080]   like anybody else, but no, I think maybe it was part
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.720]   of how I grew up, maybe it was the crowd I was with,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   maybe, but then again, you know,
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.580]   even when I started spending more time
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.200]   with academics and scientists, I mean,
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.120]   you see shadows in other ways, right?
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.680]   You see pure ambition with no passion.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.920]   I recall a colleague in San Diego who,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.740]   it was very clear to me, did not actually care
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.100]   about understanding the brain,
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.640]   but understanding the brain was just his avenue
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.220]   to exercise ambition.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.800]   And if you gave him something else to work on,
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.640]   he'd work on that.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.360]   In fact, he did, he left and he worked on something else.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.600]   I realized he has no passion for understanding the brain
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.400]   like all the, I assumed all scientists do,
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.060]   certainly why I went into it,
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.160]   but some people it's just raw ambition.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.440]   It's about winning.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.520]   It doesn't even matter what they win,
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.140]   to which to me is crazy, but I think that's a shadow
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.080]   that some people explore, not one I've explored.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.960]   I think the shadow parts of us are very important
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.920]   to come to understand and look better to understand them
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.400]   and know that they're there and work with them
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.880]   than to not acknowledge their presence
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.240]   and have them surface in the form of addictions
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.080]   or behaviors that damage us and other people.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.960]   - So one of the processes for achieving mental health
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.640]   is to bring those things to the surface.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.820]   So fish the subconscious mind.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.820]   - Yes, and Paul describes 10 cupboards
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.400]   that one can look into for exploring the self.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.880]   There's the structure of self and the function of self.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.840]   Again, this will all be spelled out in the series
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.780]   in a lot of detail, also in terms of its relational aspect
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.340]   between people, how to pick good partners
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.180]   and good relationship.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.500]   He gets really into this from a very different perspective.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.880]   Yeah, fascinating stuff.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.720]   I was just sitting there, just, I will say this,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.200]   that that four episode series with Paul
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.180]   is at least to date the most important work
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.180]   I've ever been involved in.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.280]   In all of my career, because it's very clear
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.160]   that we are not taught how to explore our subconscious
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.760]   and that very few people actually understand how to do that.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.160]   Even most psychiatrists,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.440]   he mentioned something about psychiatrists.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.520]   You know, if you're a cardiothoracic surgeon
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.320]   or something like that, and 50% of your patients die,
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.880]   you're considered a bad cardiothoracic surgeon.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.520]   But with no disrespect to psychiatrists,
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.840]   there are some excellent psychiatrists out there.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.160]   There are also a lot of terrible psychiatrists out there
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.780]   because unless all of those,
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.620]   all of their patients commit suicide or half commit suicide,
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.460]   they can treat for a long time without it becoming visible
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.180]   that they're not so good at their craft.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.460]   Now he's superb at his craft.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.180]   And I think he would say that, yes, exploring some shadows,
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.620]   but also just understanding the self.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.260]   Like what, you know, really understand,
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.980]   like who am I and what's important?
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.060]   What are my ambitions?
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.260]   What are my strivings?
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.780]   Again, I'm lifting from some of the things
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.660]   that he'll describe exactly how to do this.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.660]   People do not spend enough time addressing those questions.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.540]   And as a consequence,
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.340]   they discover what resides in their subconscious
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.360]   through the sometimes bad, hopefully also good,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.320]   but manifestations of their actions.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   We are driven by this huge 90% of our real estate
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.860]   that is not visible to our conscious awareness.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.980]   And we need to understand that.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.380]   You know, I've talked about this before.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.660]   I've done therapy twice a week since I was a kid.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.940]   I had to as a condition of being let back in school.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.980]   I continue, I found a way to either through insurance
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.020]   or even when I didn't have insurance,
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.220]   I took an extra job writing for Thrasher Magazine
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.780]   when I was a postdoc so I could pay for therapy
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.000]   at a discount 'cause I didn't make much money as a postdoc.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.540]   I mean, I think for me,
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.460]   it's as important as going to the gym.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.220]   And people think it's just, you know,
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.940]   ruminating on problems or getting, no, no, no.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.980]   If you work with somebody really good,
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.100]   they're forcing you to ask questions about
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.600]   who you really are, what you really want.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.380]   It's not just about support, but there should be support.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.100]   There should be rapport, but then it's also,
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.020]   there should be insight, right?
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.280]   Most people who get therapy, they're getting support.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.540]   There's rapport, but insight is not easy to arrive at.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.060]   And a really good psychologist or psychiatrist
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.840]   can help you arrive at deep insights
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.620]   that transform your entire life.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.140]   - Well, sometimes when I look inside and I do this often,
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.300]   you know, exploring who you truly are,
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.140]   you come to this question, do I accept,
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:11.140]   once you see parts, do I accept this or do I fix this?
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:15.420]   Is this who you are fundamentally
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.500]   and it will always be this way
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.620]   or is this a problem to be fixed?
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.080]   Like, for example, one of the things,
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.620]   especially recently, but in general,
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.180]   over time I've discovered about myself,
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.700]   probably has roots in childhood,
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.620]   probably has roots in a lot of things,
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.560]   is I deeply value loyalty,
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.300]   maybe more than the average person.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.380]   And so when there's disloyalty, it can be painful to me.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.620]   And so this is who I am.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.300]   And so do I have to relax a bit?
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.060]   Do I have to fix this part or is this who you are?
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.480]   And there's a million, that's one like little--
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.180]   - I think loyalty is a good thing to cling to,
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.160]   provided that when loyalty is broken,
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.620]   that it doesn't disrupt too many other areas of your life.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.140]   But it depends also on who's disrupting that loyalty.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.460]   If it's a coworker versus a romantic partner
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.460]   versus your exclusive romantic partner,
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.460]   depending on the structure of your romantic partner life.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.140]   You know, I mean, I have always experienced extreme
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   joy and feelings of safety and trust in my friendships.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.920]   Again, mostly male friendships, but female friendships too,
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.200]   which is only to say that they were mostly male friendships.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.640]   The female friendships have also been very loyal.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.780]   So getting backstabbed is not something I'm familiar with.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.200]   And yeah, I love being crewed up, you know?
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.280]   And I'm with you and you and I
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.120]   very much have the same values on this.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.900]   But you know, that's one little thing.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.140]   And then there's many other things.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.340]   Like I'm extremely self-critical.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.100]   And you look at my, you know, I look at myself
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.780]   as I'm regularly very self-critical.
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.860]   There's a self-critical engine in my brain.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.700]   And I talked to actually Paul about this,
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.060]   I think on the podcast quite a bit.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.680]   And he's saying, this is a really bad thing.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.300]   Like you need to fix this.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.540]   You need to be able to be regularly
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.140]   very positive about yourself.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.180]   And I kept disagreeing with him.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.380]   No, this is like who I am.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.640]   Like you, and it seems to work.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.680]   Don't mess with the thing that seems to be working.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.600]   It's fine.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.880]   Like I oscillate between being really grateful
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.300]   and really self-critical.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.520]   But then you have to like figure out what is it?
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.960]   Maybe there's a deeper root thing.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.920]   There's an, maybe there's an insecurity in there somewhere
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.360]   that has to do with childhood.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.720]   And then you're trying to prove something
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.200]   to somebody from your childhood, this kind of thing.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.920]   - Well, a couple of things that I think are
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.460]   hopefully valuable for people here.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:48.460]   One is, one way to destroy your life is to spend time
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.980]   trying to control your or somebody else's past.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:58.200]   So much of our destructive behavior and thinking
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.240]   comes from wanting something that we saw or did
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.540]   or heard to not be true.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.240]   Rather than really working with that
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.040]   and getting close to what it really was.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.760]   And, you know, sometimes those things are even traumatic
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.780]   and we need to really get close to them
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.800]   and for them to move through us.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.700]   And that, you know, there are a bunch of different ways
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.900]   to do that with support from others and hopefully,
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.240]   but sometimes on our own as well.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.700]   I don't think we can rewire our deep preferences
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.300]   and what we find despicable or joyful.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   I do think that it's really a question
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.260]   of what allows us peace.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.780]   Like, can you be at peace with the fact
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.140]   that you're very self-critical and enjoy that,
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.620]   get some distance from it, have a sense of humor about it,
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.080]   or is it driving you in a way that's keeping you awake
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.640]   at night and forcing you back to the table to do work
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.320]   in a way that feels self-flagellating and doesn't feel good?
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.040]   You know, can you get that humility and awareness
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.660]   of how you're, you know, of your one's flaws?
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.420]   And I think that that can create, you know,
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.240]   this word space sounds very new agey,
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.080]   like get space from it.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.880]   So, you know, you can have a sense of humor
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.400]   about how neurotic we can all be.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.800]   I mean, you know, neurotic isn't actually a bad term
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.640]   in the classic sense of the psychologists and psychiatrists,
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.160]   the Freudians said that, you know,
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.280]   the best case is to be neurotic,
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.620]   to actually see one's own issues and work with them,
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.960]   whereas psychotic is the other way to be,
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.480]   which is obviously not good.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.960]   So I think the question of whether or not
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.640]   to work on something or to just accept it
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.600]   as part of ourselves, I think, really depends
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.040]   if we feel like it's holding us back or not.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.920]   And I think you're asking perhaps the most profound question
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.040]   about being a human, which is, you know,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.880]   what do you do with your body?
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.720]   What do you do with your mind?
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.880]   I mean, if you, it's also a question
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.320]   we started off talking about fitness a little bit,
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.600]   which is for whatever reason, you know,
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.040]   do I need to run an ultra marathon?
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.640]   No, I don't feel like I need to.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.820]   David Goggins does, and does a whole lot more than that.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.380]   So that for him, that's important.
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.120]   For me, it's not important to do that.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.140]   I don't think he does it just so he can run the ultras.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.440]   There's clearly something else in there for him
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.000]   and guys like Cam Haines and a tremendous respect
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.580]   for what they do and how they do it.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.120]   Does one need to make their body more muscular,
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.640]   stronger, more endurance, more flexibility?
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.280]   Do you need to read harder books?
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.040]   Do you need to, I think doing hard things feels good.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.240]   I think it, I know it feels good.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   I know that the worst I feel, the worst way to feel
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.960]   is when I'm procrastinating and I don't do something.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.720]   And then whenever I do something and I complete it
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.440]   and I break through that point where it was hard
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.060]   and then I'm doing it, at the end,
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.080]   I actually feel like I was infused
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.660]   with some sort of super chemical.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.360]   And who knows if it's probably a cocktail
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.200]   of endogenously made chemicals,
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.640]   but I think it is good to do hard things,
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.520]   but you have to be careful not to destroy your body,
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.640]   your mind in the process.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.840]   And I think it's about whether or not you can achieve peace.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.320]   Can you sleep well at night?
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.960]   Stress isn't bad if you can sleep well at night.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.680]   You can be stressed all day, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.440]   And it'll optimize your focus, but can you fall asleep
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.620]   and stay deeply asleep at night?
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.440]   Being in a hard relationship, some people say,
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.680]   you know, that's not good.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.840]   Other people like it.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.680]   Can you be at peace in that?
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   And I think we all, you know, I have different RPM
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.920]   that, you know, we all kind of idle at different RPM.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.400]   And some people are big, mellow Costellos
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.880]   and others are kind of like, you know,
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.440]   need more friction in order to feel at peace.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   But I think ultimately what we want is to feel at peace.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.280]   - Yeah, I've been through some really low points
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.600]   over the past couple of years.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.360]   And I think the reason could be boiled down
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.760]   to the fact that I haven't been able
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.760]   to find a place of peace,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   a place or people or moments that give deep inner peace.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.200]   Yeah, I, you know,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.240]   I think you put it really beautifully.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.320]   It's, you have to figure out, given who you are,
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.280]   the various characteristics of your mind,
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.360]   all the things, all the contents of the cupboards,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.440]   how to get space from it.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.720]   And ultimately one good representation of that
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.480]   is to be able to laugh at all of it.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.960]   Whatever's going on inside your mind,
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.960]   to be able to step back and just kind of chuckle
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.840]   at the beauty and the absurdity of the whole thing.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.960]   - Yeah, and keep going.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.680]   There's this beautiful, as I mentioned,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.520]   seems like every podcast lately,
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.480]   I'm a huge Rancid fan,
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.360]   mostly 'cause I just think Tim Armstrong's writing
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.720]   is pure poetry and whether or not you like the music or not,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.880]   you know, and he's written music
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.080]   for a lot of other people too.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.280]   He's not, doesn't advertise that much 'cause he's humble.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.760]   But I-- - And by the way,
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.480]   I went to a show of theirs like 20 years ago.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.800]   - Oh yeah, I'm going to see them in Boston, September 18th.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.320]   I'm literally flying there for,
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.880]   or I'll take the train from New York.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.600]   I'm gonna meet a friend of mine named Jim Thiebaud,
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.840]   who's a guy who owns a lot of companies
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.280]   in skateboard industry.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.880]   We're meeting there, like a couple of little kids
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.960]   to go see them play.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.640]   Amazing, amazing people, amazing music.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.240]   - Very intense. - Very intense.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.520]   But embodies all the different emotions.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.440]   That's why I love it, right?
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.240]   They have some love songs, they have some hate songs,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.960]   they have some, and, but you know, there's,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.120]   going back to what you said, I think there's a song,
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.720]   the first song on the "Indestructible" album,
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.240]   I think it, there's a, it's sort of,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.120]   he's just talking about like shock and disbelief
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.160]   of discovering things about people that were close to you.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.280]   And you know, it's, I won't sing it,
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.520]   but you know, nor I wouldn't dare.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.060]   But there's this one lyric where,
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.240]   that's really stuck in my mind for,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.720]   ever since that album came out in 2003,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   which is, you know, that nothing's what it seems.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.580]   So I just sit here laughing, I'm going to keep going on.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.200]   I can't get distracted.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.300]   There is this piece of like,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.640]   you got to learn how to push out
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.220]   the disturbing stuff sometimes and go forward.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.920]   And I mean, I remember hearing that lyric
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.440]   and then writing it down.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.120]   And you know, that was a time where my undergraduate advisor
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.640]   who was like a mentor and a father to me, you know,
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   blew his head off in the bathtub, like three weeks before.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.560]   And then my graduate advisor who I was working for
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.880]   at that time, who I loved and adored,
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.240]   was really like a mother to me.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.400]   I knew her when she was pregnant with her two kids,
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.480]   died at 50, breast cancer.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.880]   And then my postdoc advisor, you know,
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.720]   first day of work at Stanford as a faculty member,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.240]   sitting across the table like this from him,
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.520]   had a heart attack right in front of me,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.720]   died of pancreatic cancer at the end of 2017.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.280]   And I remember just thinking like, you know,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.080]   going back to that song there over and over, like,
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.280]   and where people would, you know,
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.720]   I haven't had many betrayals in life.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.480]   I've had a few, but just thinking like,
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.440]   or seeing something or learning something about something,
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.400]   you just like, you can't believe it.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:04.400]   And I mentioned that lyric off that first song,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.400]   Indestructible, on that album,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.960]   because it's this, like just the raw emotion of like,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.060]   I can't believe this, what I just saw is so disturbing,
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.720]   but I have to just keep going forward.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.560]   There are certain things that we really do need
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.960]   to push not just into our periphery,
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.800]   but often to the gutter and keep going.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.320]   And that's a hard thing to learn how to do.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   But if you're going to be functional in life, you have to.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.120]   And actually just to get at this issue of do I change
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.480]   or do I embrace this aspect of self,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.520]   about six months, it was April of this last year,
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.560]   I did some intense work around some things
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.200]   that were really challenging to me.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.780]   And I did it alone,
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.320]   and it may have involved some medicine.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.780]   And I expected to get peace through this.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.000]   I was like, I'm going to let go of it.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And I spent 11 hours just getting more and more frustrated
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.520]   and angry about this thing that I was trying to resolve.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.120]   And I was so unbelievably disappointed
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.320]   that I couldn't get that relief.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.440]   And I was like, what is this?
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.360]   Like, this is not how this is supposed to work.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.240]   I'm supposed to feel peace, the clouds are supposed to lift.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.120]   And so a week went by, and then another half week went by.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.980]   And then someone whose opinion I trust very much,
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.300]   I explained this to them
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.860]   because I was getting a little concerned,
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.540]   like what's going on, this is worse, not better.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.540]   And they said, this is very simple.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.020]   You have a giant blind spot,
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.540]   which is your sense of justice, Andrew,
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.720]   and your sense of anger are linked like an iron rod,
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.180]   and you need to relax it.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.580]   And as they said that, I felt the anger dissipate.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.580]   And so there was something that I think is, it is true.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.060]   I have a very strong sense of justice
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.120]   and my sense of anger, then at least,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.260]   was very strongly linked to it.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.300]   So it's great to have a sense of justice, right?
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.660]   I hate to see people wronged, I absolutely do.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.780]   And I'm human, I'm sure I've wronged people in my life.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.780]   I know I have, they've told me,
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.220]   I've tried to apologize and reconcile where possible.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.780]   Still have a lot of work to do.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.600]   But where I see injustice,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.680]   it draws in my sense of anger in a way
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.100]   that I think is just eating me up.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.660]   And, but it was only in hearing that link
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.640]   that I wasn't aware of before,
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.820]   it was in my subconscious, obviously,
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.700]   did I feel the relaxation.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.860]   It wasn't, there's no amount of plant medicine or MDMA
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.460]   or any kind of chemical you can take
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.380]   that's naturally just going to dissipate
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.020]   what's hard for oneself.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.100]   It needs, if one embraces that,
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.460]   or if one chooses to do it through just talk therapy
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.340]   or journaling or friends or introspection
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.420]   or all of the above,
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.180]   there needs to be an awareness
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.260]   of the things that we're just not aware of.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.700]   So I think the answer to your question,
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.540]   do you embrace or do you fight these aspects of self is,
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.380]   I think you get in your subconscious
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.620]   through good work with somebody skilled,
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.320]   or sometimes that involves the tools I just mentioned
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.900]   in various combinations, and you figure it out.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.460]   You figure out if it's serving you.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.900]   Obviously it was not bringing me peace.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.180]   It was undermining, my sense of justice
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.620]   was undermining my sense of peace.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.660]   And so in understanding this link,
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.140]   now I would say that in understanding this link
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.780]   between justice and anger,
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.620]   now I think it's a little bit more of like,
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.540]   you know, it's not like a Twizzler stick bendy,
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.780]   but it's at least it's not like an iron rod.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.580]   Like, you know, when I see somebody wronged,
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.380]   I mean, it used to just like, like immediately.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.740]   - But you're able to step back.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.540]   Now that's like, to me,
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:41.420]   the ultimate place to reach is laughter.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.900]   - I just sit here laughing.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.740]   Exactly, that's the lyric.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.020]   I like, I can't believe it.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.900]   So I just sit here laughing, like can't get distracted.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.980]   Just at some point, but the problem, I think,
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.500]   in just laughing at something, like that gives you distance.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.660]   But the question is,
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.500]   do you stop engaging with it at that point?
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.380]   Like I experienced this, I mean,
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.220]   recently I got to see how sometimes I'll see something
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.540]   that's just like, what?
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.380]   Like, this is crazy.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.300]   So I just laugh, but then I continue to engage in it
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.940]   and it's taking me off course.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.460]   And so there is a place where, you know, I mean,
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.580]   I get realized this is probably a kid's show too.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.060]   So I want to keep it, you know, G rated,
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.420]   but at some point for certain things,
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.860]   it makes sense to go, fuck that.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.140]   - But also laugh at yourself for saying, fuck that.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.460]   - Yeah, and then move on.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.380]   So the question is, do you get stuck or do you move on?
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.660]   - Sure, sure.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.260]   But like, there's a lightness of being
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.220]   that comes with laughter.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.020]   I mean, I've gotten, like, as you know,
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.140]   I spent the day with Elon today.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.220]   He just gave me this burnt hair.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.060]   Do you know what this is?
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:46.940]   - I have no idea.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.220]   - I'm sure there's actually,
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:50.660]   it should be a "Human Lab" episode on this.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.380]   It's a cologne that's burnt hair.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.380]   And it's like supposedly a really intense smell.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.220]   And it is.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.060]   - Give me a smell.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.260]   - Please, it's not going to leave your nose.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.100]   - That's okay.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:34:59.940]   Well, that's okay.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.940]   I'll take a gentle, I'll whiff it as if I were whiffing
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.780]   a chemical in the lab. - You have to actually
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.580]   spray it on yourself, 'cause I don't know if you can.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.380]   - So I'm reading an amazing book
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.260]   called "An Immense World" by Ed Young.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.900]   He won a Pulitzer for "We Contain Multitudes"
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.900]   or something like that,
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.900]   I think is the title of the other book.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   And the first chapter is all about olfaction
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.220]   and the incredible power that olfaction has.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.900]   That smells terrible.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.140]   I don't even- - I mean, it doesn't leave you.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.300]   Ah, for those listening,
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.580]   it doesn't quite smell terrible.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.500]   It's just intense and it stays with you.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.260]   - This to me represents just laughing
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.660]   at the absurdity of it all.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.780]   - So I have to ask, so you were rolling jiu-jitsu?
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.180]   - Yeah, we're training jiu-jitsu, yeah.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.780]   - So is that fight between Elon and Azok
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.060]   actually going to happen?
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.460]   - I think Elon is a huge believer of this idea
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.580]   of the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.460]   And he almost, there is almost the sense
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.660]   that there's not a free will
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.020]   and the universe has a kind of deterministic,
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.420]   gravitational field pulling towards the most fun.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.980]   And he's just the player in that game.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.900]   So from that perspective, I think it seems like
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.300]   something like that is inevitable.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.420]   - Like a little scrap in the parking lot
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.860]   of a Facebook or something like that?
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.260]   - Exactly. - Sorry, meta.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.340]   - Yeah. - But it looks like
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.620]   they're training for real and Azok has competed, right?
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.460]   In jiu-jitsu.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.220]   - So I think he is approaching it as a sport.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.980]   Elon is approaching it as a spectacle.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.900]   And I mean, the way he talks about it,
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.980]   he's a huge fan of history.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.420]   He talks about all the warriors
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.980]   that have fought throughout history.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.020]   If you look, he wants to really do it at the Coliseum.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.820]   And the Coliseum is for 400 years,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.320]   there's so much great writing about this.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.540]   I think over 400,000 people have died
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.580]   in the Coliseum, gladiators.
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.940]   So this is this historic place that sheds so much blood,
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.620]   so much fear, so much anticipation of battle, all of this.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.180]   So he loves this kind of spectacle.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.860]   And also the meme of it, the hilarious absurdity of it,
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.900]   that two tech CEOs are battling it out on sand
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.140]   in a place where gladiators fought to the death
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.360]   and then bears and lions ate prisoners
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.300]   as part of the execution process.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.140]   - Well, it's also gonna be an instance
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.380]   where Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.660]   has changed bodily fluids.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.260]   They bleed, this one, things about fighting.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.780]   I think it was in that book, it's a great book,
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.860]   "Fighter's Heart," where he talks about
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.180]   sort of the intimacy of sparring.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.620]   I only rolled Jiu-Jitsu with you once,
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.860]   but there was a period of time where I boxed,
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.080]   and which I don't recommend.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.020]   I got hit, I hit some guys, and I definitely got hit back.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:50.740]   I'd spar on Wednesday nights when I lived on San Diego.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.540]   And when you spar with somebody,
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.820]   even if they hurt you, especially if they hurt you,
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.060]   you see that person afterwards,
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.060]   and there's an intimacy, right?
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.820]   It was in that book, "Fighter's Heart,"
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.180]   where he explains, you're exchanging bodily fluids
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.660]   with a stranger, right?
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:11.120]   And you're in your primitive mind,
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.860]   and so there's an intimacy there that persists.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.380]   - You go together through a process of fear, anxiety.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.780]   - Yeah, when they get you, you nod 'em,
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.580]   you watch somebody catch somebody,
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.540]   not so much in professional fighting,
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.820]   but if people are sparring and they catch you,
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.780]   you acknowledge that they caught you.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.780]   Like, "He got me there."
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.980]   - And on the flip side of that, so we trained,
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.740]   and then after that, we played "Diablo IV."
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.180]   - I don't know what that is.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.700]   I don't play video games, sorry.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:42.700]   - But it's a video game, so it's a pretty intense combat.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.140]   You're fighting demons and dragons.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.340]   - Last video game I played was Mike Tyson's "Punch Out."
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.180]   - There you go, that's pretty cool.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.060]   - I met him recently, it went on his podcast.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.260]   - You went, wait.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.100]   - It hasn't come out yet.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:53.940]   - It hasn't come out yet, okay.
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.580]   - Yeah, I asked Mike, his kids are great.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.780]   They came in there, they're super smart kids.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.320]   Goodness gracious, they ask great questions.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.500]   Asked Mike what he did with the piece of Evander's ear
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.340]   that he bit off.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.180]   - Do you remember?
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.700]   - Yeah, he's like, "Get back to him."
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.620]   (laughing)
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.060]   - Here you go, sorry about that.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.660]   - He sells edibles that are in the shape of ears
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.100]   with a little bite out of it.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.540]   Yeah, his life has been incredible.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.900]   He's, and I met, yeah, his family,
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.060]   you get the sense that they're really a great family.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.260]   They're really--
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.340]   - Mike Tyson?
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.500]   That's a heck of a journey right there of a man.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.980]   - Yeah, my now friend, Tim Armstrong,
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.060]   like I said, lead singer from Ranci, he put it best.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:42.380]   He said that Mike Tyson's life is Shakespearean
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.980]   and down, up, down, up,
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.300]   and just the arcs of his life are just like
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.260]   sort of an only in America kind of tale too, right?
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.380]   - So speaking of Shakespeare,
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.380]   I recently gotten to know Neri Oxman,
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.260]   who's this incredible scientist
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.460]   that works at the intersection of nature and engineering,
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:06.460]   and she reminded me of this Anna Akhmatova line.
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:11.460]   This is this great Soviet poet that I really love
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.380]   from over a century ago,
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.140]   that each of our lives is a Shakespearean drama
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.920]   raised to the thousand degree.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.540]   So I have to ask, why do you think humans are attracted
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.900]   to this kind of Shakespearean drama?
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:29.420]   Is there some aspect, we've been talking about,
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.860]   the subconscious mind that pulls us towards the drama,
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.740]   even though the place of mental health is peace?
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.740]   - Yes and yes.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:40.980]   - Do you have some of that?
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.860]   - A draw towards drama?
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.900]   - If you look at the empirical data.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.160]   - Yes, I mean, right.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.300]   If I look at the empirical data,
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.660]   I mean, I think about who I chose to work for
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.620]   as an undergraduate, right?
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.820]   I was a barely finished high school,
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.580]   finally get to college, barely,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.860]   I think this is really embarrassing
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.340]   and not something to aspire to.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:05.380]   You know, I was thrown out of the dorms for fighting,
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.540]   barely passed my classes.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.340]   The girlfriend and I split up.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.700]   I mean, I was living in a squat,
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.980]   got into a big fight,
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.820]   I was getting in trouble with the law.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.540]   Then she got my act together, go back to school,
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.580]   start working for somebody.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.340]   Who do I choose to work for?
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.660]   A guy who's an ex Navy guy
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.820]   who smoked cigarettes in the fume hood,
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.380]   drinks coffee and we're injecting rats with MDMA.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.660]   And, you know, I was drawn to like the personality,
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.500]   his energy, but I also, he was a great,
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.620]   he was great scientist,
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.300]   worked out a lot on a thermal regulation in the brain
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.400]   and more.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.540]   You know, go to graduate school,
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.340]   I'm working for somebody and decide that,
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.100]   yeah, doing, working in her laboratory
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:45.980]   wasn't quite right for me.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.220]   So I'm literally sneaking into the laboratory next door
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.780]   and working for the woman next door
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.700]   because I liked the relationships that she had
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.140]   to a certain set of questions.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.980]   And she was a kind of a quirky person, you know,
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.620]   so drawn to drama, but drawn to, I like characters.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.700]   I like people that have texture
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.780]   and I'm not drawn to raw ambition.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.980]   I'm drawn to people that seem to have a real passion
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.460]   for what they do and a uniqueness to them
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.540]   that I, you know, you can kind of, not kind of,
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.460]   I'll just say how it is.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.760]   I can feel their heart for what they do.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.340]   And I'm drawn to that, like, and that can be good.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.540]   The same reason I went to work for Ben Barris as a postdoc.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.220]   It wasn't because he was the first transgender member
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.380]   of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.580]   That was just a feature of who he was.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.420]   I loved how he loved glia.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.920]   He would talk about these cells,
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.700]   like they were the most enchanting things
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.960]   that he'd ever seen in his life.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.700]   And I was like, this is like the biggest nerd
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.740]   I've ever met and I love him.
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.680]   I think I'm drawn to that.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.900]   This is another thing that Conti makes,
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.580]   elaborates on quite a bit more
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.420]   in the series on mental health coming out,
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.700]   but there are different drives within us.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.920]   There's this, there are aggressive drives,
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.580]   not always for fighting, but for intense interaction.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.260]   I mean, look at Twitter, look at some of the,
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.820]   look at people clearly have an aggressive drive.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.680]   There's also a pleasure drive.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.480]   Some people also have a strong pleasure drive.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.440]   They want to experience pleasure through food,
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.520]   through sex, through friendship, through adventure,
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.080]   you know, but I think the Shakespearean drama
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.680]   is the drama of the different drives
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.580]   in different ratios in different people.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.760]   I know somebody and she's incredibly kind,
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.400]   has an extremely high pleasure drive,
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.640]   loves taking great care of herself and people around her
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.720]   through food and through retreats
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.080]   and through all these things and makes spaces beautiful
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.120]   everywhere she goes and is gifts these things
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.160]   that are just so unbelievably feminine
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.320]   and incredible, these gifts to people
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   and the kind and thoughtful about what they like.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.880]   And then, but I would say very little aggressive drive
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.080]   from my read.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.520]   And then I know other people who are,
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.200]   just have a ton of aggressive drive
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.540]   and very little pleasure drive.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.480]   And I think, so there's this alchemy that exists
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.640]   where people have these things in different ratios
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.840]   and then you blend in, you know,
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.080]   the differences in the chromosomes
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.280]   and differences in hormones
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.600]   and differences in personal history.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.120]   And what you end up with is a species
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   that creates incredible recipes of drama,
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.300]   but also peace, also relief from drama, contentment.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.840]   I mean, I realize this isn't the exact topic
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.020]   of the question, but someone I know very dearly,
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.840]   actually an ex-girlfriend of mine,
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.320]   long-term partner of mine sent me something recently.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.400]   I think it hit the nail on the head,
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.760]   which is that ideally for a man,
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.960]   they eventually settle where they find and feel peace.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.260]   Where they feel peaceful,
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.480]   where they can be themselves and feel peaceful.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.680]   Now, I'm sure there's a equivalent
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.160]   or mirror image of that for women,
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.000]   but this particular post that she sent was about men.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.320]   And I totally agree.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.480]   And so it isn't always that we're seeking friction,
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.280]   but for periods of our life, we seek friction,
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   drama, adventure, excitement, fights, you know,
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.120]   and doing hard, hard things.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.320]   And then I think at some point,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.560]   I'm certainly coming to this point now where it's like,
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.120]   yeah, that's all great.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.520]   And checked a lot of boxes,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.640]   but had a lot of close calls,
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.640]   flew really close to the sun on a lot of things
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   with life and limb and heart and spirit.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.120]   And some of, you know, people close to us didn't make it.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.960]   And sometimes not making it means
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.640]   the career they wanted went off a cliff
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.960]   or their health went off a cliff
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.460]   or their life went off a cliff.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.640]   But I think that there's also the Shakespearean drama
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.520]   of the characters that exit the play
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.960]   and are living their lives happily in the backdrop.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.320]   It just doesn't make for as much entertainment.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:52.640]   - That's one other thing that's a benefit.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.640]   You could say it's a benefit of getting older
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.800]   is finding the Shakespearean drama less appealing
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.740]   or finding the joy in the piece.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.660]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.720]   I mean, I think that, I think there's real peace with age.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.560]   I think the other thing is this notion
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:11.000]   of checking boxes is a real thing, for me anyway.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.340]   I have a morning meditation that I do.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:17.200]   Well, I wake up now and get my sunlight, I hydrate,
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.760]   I use the bathroom, I do all the things that I talk about.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.440]   I've started to practice a prayer in the last year,
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.640]   which is new-ish for me,
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.040]   which is, we could talk about it if you want.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.080]   - In the morning? - Yeah.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.240]   - Can you talk about it a little bit?
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.400]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.520]   And then I have a meditation that I do
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.360]   that actually is where I think through
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.200]   what the different roles that I play.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.340]   So I start very basic.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.000]   I say, okay, I'm an animal.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.960]   Like we are biologically animals, right?
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.200]   Human, you know?
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.520]   I'm a man, I'm a scientist, I'm a teacher,
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.280]   I'm a friend, I'm a brother, I'm a son.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.640]   You know, I go through this, I have this list
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.920]   and I think about the different roles that I have
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.160]   and the roles that I still want in my life going forward
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.200]   that I haven't yet fulfilled.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.520]   It just takes me, it's sort of an inventory
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.400]   of where I've been, where I'm at,
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.060]   and where I'm going, as they say.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.360]   And I don't know why I do it,
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.400]   but I started doing it this last year,
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.240]   I think because it helps me understand
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.440]   just how many different contexts I have to exist in
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.080]   and remind myself that there's still more
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.440]   that I haven't done, that I'm excited about.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.900]   - So within each of those contexts,
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.880]   there's like things that you want to kind of accomplish
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.120]   to define that.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.320]   - Yeah, and I'm ambitious.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.840]   So I think, you know, I'm a brother.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.920]   I have an older sister and I love her tremendously.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.120]   And I think like, I want to be the best brother
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.480]   I can be to her, which means maybe a call,
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.680]   maybe just, you know, we do an annual trip together
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.200]   for our birthdays, our birthdays are close together.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.520]   We always go to New York for our birthdays
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.920]   if we've gone for the last three, four years.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.880]   Like really like reminding myself of that role,
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.880]   not because I'll forget,
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.040]   but because I have all these other roles
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.200]   I'll get pulled into.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.800]   I say the first one, I'm an animal
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.600]   because I have to remember that I have a body
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.900]   that needs care, like any of us.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.880]   I need sleep, I need food, I need hydration.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.200]   I need that I'm human,
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.600]   that the brain of a human is marvelously complex,
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:12.200]   but also marvelously self-defeating at times.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.800]   And so I've been thinking about these things
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.160]   in the context of the different roles.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.120]   And the whole thing takes about four or five minutes.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.900]   And I just find it brings me a certain amount of clarity
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.200]   that then allows me to ratchet into the day.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.960]   The prayer piece, yeah, I think I've been reluctant
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.160]   to talk about until now
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.920]   because I don't believe in pushing religion on people.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.620]   And I think that, and I'm not,
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.000]   it's a highly individual thing.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.640]   And I do believe that one can be an atheist and still pray
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.920]   or agnostic and still pray.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.760]   But for me, it really came about through understanding
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.520]   that there are certain aspects of myself
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.120]   that I just couldn't resolve on my own.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.760]   And no matter how much therapy, no matter how much,
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.800]   and I haven't done a lot of it,
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.000]   but no matter how much plant medicine
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   or other forms of medicine or exercise or podcasting
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.940]   or science or friendship or any of that,
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.740]   I was just not going to resolve.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:22.740]   And so I started this because someone close to me said,
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:31.100]   a male friend said, "Prayer is powerful."
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.300]   And I said, "Well, how?"
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:33.260]   And he said, "I don't know how,
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.640]   but if you can get,
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.560]   it can allow you to get outside yourself,
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.920]   let you give up control and at the same time take control."
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.040]   I don't even like saying take control,
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.520]   but the whole notion is that, again, forgive me,
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.020]   but there's no other way to say it.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.360]   The whole notion is that, you know,
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.440]   like God works through us, whatever God is to you,
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.520]   he, him, her, whatever, life force, nature,
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.880]   whatever it is to you, right?
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.480]   That it works through us.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.320]   And so I do a prayer, I'll just describe it,
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   where I ask, I make an ask to help remove my defects,
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.540]   my character defects.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.680]   I pray to God to help remove my character defects
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.880]   so that I can show up better in all the roles of my life
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.960]   and do good work, like to,
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.480]   which for me is learning and teaching,
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.800]   learning and teaching.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.280]   And so you might say,
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.880]   "Well, how is that different than a meditation?"
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.720]   Well, I'm acknowledging that there is something
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:32.800]   that bigger than me, bigger than nature, as I understand it,
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.720]   that I cannot understand or control, nor do I want to,
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.680]   and I'm just giving over to that.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.160]   And does that make me less of a scientist?
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.840]   I sure as hell hope not.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.260]   I certainly know, there's the head of our neurosciences
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.880]   at Stanford until recently.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.400]   You should talk to him directly about it.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.380]   Bill Newsom has talked about his religious life.
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:56.440]   For me, it's really a way of getting outside myself
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.680]   and then understanding how I fit into this bigger picture.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.600]   And the character defects part is real, right?
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.900]   I'm a human, I have defects,
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.340]   like I got a lot of flaws in me, like anybody,
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:13.340]   but, and trying to acknowledge them
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.700]   and asking for help in removing them,
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.620]   not magically, but through right action,
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.600]   through my right action.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.140]   So I do that every morning.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.100]   And I have to say that it's helped.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:26.920]   It's helped a lot.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.540]   It's helped me be better to myself,
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.520]   be better at other people.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.780]   I still make mistakes,
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:36.780]   but it's becoming a bigger and bigger part of my life.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.740]   And I never thought I'd talk like this,
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:44.660]   but I think it's clear to me that
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:50.860]   if we don't believe in something,
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.780]   again, doesn't have to be traditional standardized religion,
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.980]   but if we don't believe in something bigger than ourselves,
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:01.140]   we at some level will self-destruct.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.680]   I really think so.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.240]   And it's powerful in a way that all the other stuff,
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.840]   meditation and all the tools is not
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.440]   because it's really operating at a much deeper
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.920]   and bigger level.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:19.920]   And, you know, yeah, I think that's all I can talk about.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.720]   It mostly because I'm still working out,
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.200]   you know, the scientists in me wants to understand
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.880]   how it works and I want to understand.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.600]   And the point is to just go, you know,
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.920]   there's, you know, for lack of a better language for it,
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.200]   there's higher power than me and what I can control.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.400]   I'm giving up control on certain things.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.600]   And somehow that restores a sense of agency
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.040]   for right action, better action.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.180]   - I think perhaps a part of that is just the humility
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.040]   that comes with acknowledging there's something bigger
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.280]   and more powerful than you.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.400]   - And then you can't control everything.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.640]   It's, I mean, you go through life as a hard driving person,
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.960]   you know, forward center of mass.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.080]   I remember being that way since I was little.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.280]   It's like a new Legos, I'm like, I'm gonna make all the Legos.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.000]   I was like on the weekends, you know,
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.560]   learning about medieval weapons
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.200]   and then giving lectures about it in class
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.880]   when I was five or six years old.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.720]   We're learning about tropical fish and, you know,
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.000]   cataloging all of them at the store and then organizing it
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.680]   and make my, you know, my dad drive me
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.120]   or my mom drive me to some fish store
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.180]   and then spending all my time there
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.400]   until they throw me out, you know, all of that.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.840]   But I also remember my entire life, I would secretly pray
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.800]   when things were good and things weren't good,
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.160]   but mostly when things weren't good,
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.420]   'cause it's important to pray for me,
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.320]   it's important to pray each morning regardless.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:39.800]   But when things weren't right, I couldn't make sense of them,
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.640]   I would secretly pray, but I felt kind of ashamed of that
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.720]   for whatever reason.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.240]   And then it was once in college, I distinctly remember
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.440]   I was having a hard time with a number of things
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:54.820]   and I took a run down to Sands Beach, it was UC San Barbara.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.720]   And I remember I just, I was like,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.260]   I don't know if I even have the right to do this,
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.320]   but I'm just praying.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   I just prayed for the ability to be as brutally honest
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:11.400]   with myself and with other people as I possibly could be
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.420]   about a particular situation I was in at that time.
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.220]   I mean, I think now it's probably safe to say
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.440]   I'd gone off to college
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.520]   'cause of a high school girlfriend.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.640]   We'd, essentially she was my family,
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.920]   frankly more than my biological family was
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.160]   at a certain stage of life.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.200]   And we'd reached a point where we were diverging
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.400]   and it was incredibly painful.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.800]   It was like losing everything I had.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.000]   And it's like, what do I do?
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   How do I manage this?
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.720]   Do I, you know, I was ready to quit
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.360]   and join the fire service just to support us
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:39.400]   so that we could move forward.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.560]   And, you know, it was just, but praying,
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.880]   just saying, I can't figure this out on my own.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:48.060]   It's sort of like, I can't figure this out on my own.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.020]   And how frustrating that is,
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.180]   no number of friends could tell me,
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.300]   and inner wisdom couldn't tell me,
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.180]   and eventually it led me to the right answers.
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.880]   And she and I are friendly friends to this day.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.420]   She's happily married with a child and we're on good terms.
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:06.420]   But I think, you know, it's a scary thing,
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:10.780]   but it's the best thing when you,
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:11.860]   I can't control all this.
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.880]   And asking for help, I think is also the piece.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.300]   You're not asking for some magic hand
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:17.140]   to come down and take care of it.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.580]   You're asking for the help to come through you, right?
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.540]   So that your body is used to do these right works,
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:24.500]   right action.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.560]   - Isn't it interesting that this secret thing
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.700]   that you're almost embarrassed by,
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.020]   that you did it as a child, is something you,
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.820]   it's another thing you do as you get older,
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.100]   is you realize like those things are part of you,
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.020]   and it's actually a beautiful thing.
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.380]   - A lot of the content of the podcast
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.820]   is deep academic content.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.180]   And we talk about everything from, you know,
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.720]   eating disorders to bipolar disorder to depression,
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.000]   you know, a lot of different topics,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.720]   but the tools are the protocols, as we say, right?
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.680]   The sunlight viewing and all the rest.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.120]   You know, a lot of that stuff is just stuff
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.440]   I wish I had known when I was in graduate school.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.240]   If I had known to go outside every once in a while
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.740]   and get some sunlight, not just stay in the lab,
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.820]   I would have, you know, I might not have hit
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.480]   like a really tough round of depression
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.140]   when I was a postdoc and working twice as hard.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.320]   And, you know, when my body would break down
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.200]   or I'd get sick a lot,
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.760]   I don't get sick much anymore occasionally,
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.320]   about once every 18 months to two years,
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.720]   I get, you know, I'll get something.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.440]   But, you know, I used to break my foot
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.280]   skateboarding all the time.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.720]   I couldn't understand what's wrong with my body.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.540]   I'm getting injured.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.460]   I can't do what everyone else can.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.120]   Now I developed more slowly at a long arc of puberty,
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:30.920]   but I, so that was part of it.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.280]   I was still developing, but you know,
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.240]   how to get your body stronger, how to build endurance.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.660]   Like no one told me, the information wasn't there.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.480]   So a lot of what I put out there is the information
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.780]   that I wish I had had, because once I had it,
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.300]   I was like, wow, like A, this stuff really works.
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.500]   B, it's grounded in something real.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.080]   You know, sometimes certain protocols are a combination of,
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.040]   you know, animal, human and animal and human studies,
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:53.980]   sometimes clinical trials.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.860]   Sometimes there's some mechanistic conjecture for some,
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:59.640]   not all, I always make clear which,
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   but in the end, like figuring out how things work
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.040]   so that we can be happier, healthier, more productive,
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:11.860]   suffer less, like reduce the suffering of the world.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:16.860]   And I think that, well, I'll just say thank you
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:22.060]   for asking about the prayer piece.
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:27.040]   Again, I'm not pushing or even encouraging it on anyone.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.780]   I've just found it to be tremendously useful for me.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:34.860]   - You know, I mean, about prayer in general,
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:38.160]   you said information and figuring out how to get stronger,
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.240]   healthier, smarter, all those kinds of things.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:45.080]   A part of me believes that deeply, you know,
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:49.340]   you can gain a lot of knowledge and wisdom through learning,
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:53.240]   but a part of me believes that all the wisdom I need
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:57.900]   was there when I was 11 and 12 years old.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.040]   - And then it got cluttered over.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:03.400]   Well, listen, I can't wait for you and Conti to talk again,
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.500]   because when he gets going about the subconscious
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.540]   and the amount of this that sits below the surface,
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:13.260]   like an iceberg, and the fact that when we're kids,
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:18.260]   we're not obscuring a lot of that subconscious as much.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:21.240]   And sometimes that can look a little more primitive.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:26.240]   I mean, a kid that's disappointed will let you know.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.720]   A kid that's excited will let you know.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.840]   And you feel that raw exuberance or that raw dismay.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.460]   And I think that as we grow older,
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.700]   we learn to cover that stuff up.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.540]   We wear masks and we have to, to be functional.
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.860]   And I don't think we all want to go around
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.980]   just being completely raw.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.040]   But as you said, as you get older,
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.500]   you also get to this point where you kind of go,
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:53.020]   eh, you know, what are we really trying to protect anyway?
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.340]   I mean, I have this theory that, you know,
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:59:00.340]   certainly my experience has taught me that a lot of people,
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:06.220]   but I'll talk about men 'cause that's what I know best,
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:10.920]   whether or not they show up strong or not,
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:15.840]   that they're really afraid of being weak.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.000]   Like they're just afraid,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.520]   like sometimes the strength is even a way
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.680]   to try and not be weak, right?
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.360]   Which is different than being strong for its own sake.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.640]   I'm not just talking about physical strength.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.760]   I'm talking about intellectual strength.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.600]   I'm talking about money.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.040]   I'm talking about expressing drive.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:34.060]   I've been watching this series a little bit of Chimp Empire.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.220]   - Oh yeah.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.420]   - So Chimp Empire is amazing, right?
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.780]   They have the head chimp, he's not the head chimp,
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:44.660]   but the alpha in the group and he's getting older.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.060]   And so what does he do?
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:49.580]   Every once in a while, he goes on these vigor displays.
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.660]   He goes and he grabs branch, he starts breaking them,
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.500]   he starts thrashing them and he's incredibly strong.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.960]   And they're all kind of like watching.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.780]   I mean, yeah, I immediately think of people
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:58.940]   like they're dead lifting on Instagram.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.360]   And I just think, displays of vigor.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.360]   This is just the primate showing that displays the vigor.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.000]   Now what's interesting is that he's doing that specifically
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.400]   to say, hey, I still have what it takes to lead this troop.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.960]   Okay, then there are the ones that are subordinate to him,
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.020]   but not so far behind.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.960]   - It seems to be that there's a very clear
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.360]   like numerical ranking.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.200]   - There is.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.560]   - Like it's clear who's the number two, number three.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.400]   - Oh yeah.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.240]   - I mean, probably-
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.160]   - Who gets to mate first, who gets to eat first.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.980]   This exists in other animal societies too,
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.860]   but Bob Sapolsky would be a great person
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.980]   to talk about this with,
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.220]   'cause he knows obviously tremendous amount about it.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.600]   And I know just the top contour, but yeah.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.320]   So number two, three and four males are aware
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.600]   that he's doing these vigor displays,
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.440]   but they're also aware because in primate evolution,
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.020]   they got some extra forebrain too, not as much as us,
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.140]   but they got some.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.900]   And they're aware that the vigor displays are displays
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.280]   that because they've done them as well
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.680]   in a different context,
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.560]   might not just be displays of vigor,
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.480]   but might also be an insurance policy
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.700]   against people seeing weakness.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:08.480]   Okay, so now they start using that prefrontal cortex
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.640]   to do some interesting things.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.480]   So in primate world,
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.640]   if a male is friendly with another male,
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.080]   wants to affiliate with him and say,
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.920]   "Hey, I'm backing you."
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.000]   They'll go over and they'll pick off
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.320]   the little parasites and eat them.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.060]   And so the grooming is extremely important.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.600]   In fact, if they want to ostracize
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.100]   or kill one of the members of their troop,
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.380]   they will just leave it alone.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.300]   No one will groom it.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.900]   And then there's actually a really disturbing sequence
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.100]   in that show of then the parasites start to eat away
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.180]   on their skin, they get infections, they have issues.
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.380]   No one will mate with them.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.780]   No one, they have other issues as well
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.760]   and can potentially die.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.020]   So the interesting thing is, is number two and three
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.600]   start to line up a strategy to groom this guy,
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.380]   but they are actually thinking about overtaking
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.980]   the entire troop, setting in a new alpha.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.120]   But the current alpha did that to get where he is.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.860]   So he knows that they're doing this grooming thing,
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.180]   but they're not, might not be sincere about the grooming.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.020]   So what does he do?
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.120]   He takes the whole troop on a raid to another troop
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.140]   and sees who will fight for him and who won't.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:19.140]   This is advanced contracting of behavior
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.560]   for species that normally we don't think of
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.160]   as sophisticated as us.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.200]   So it's very interesting and it gets to something
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.040]   that I hope we'll have an opportunity to talk about
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.760]   'cause it's something that I'm obsessed with lately
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.020]   is this notion of overt versus covert contracts, right?
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.760]   There are overt contracts where you exchange work for money
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.520]   or you exchange any number of things in an overt way,
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.080]   but then there are covert contracts
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.840]   and those take on a very different form
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.640]   and always lead to, in my belief, bad things.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.180]   - Well, how much of human and chimp relationships
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.060]   are overt versus covert?
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.640]   - Well, here's one thing that we know is true.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.020]   Dogs and humans, the dog to human relationship
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.940]   is 100% overt.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.120]   They don't manipulate you.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.740]   Now you could say they do in the sense that they learn
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.540]   that if they look a certain way or roll on their back,
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:13.540]   they get food, but there's no banking of that behavior
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.780]   for a future date where then they are going
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.720]   to undermine you and take your position, okay?
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.380]   So in that sense, dogs can be a little bit manipulative
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:27.380]   in some sense, but now, okay, so overt contract would be,
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.100]   we both wanna do some work together,
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.720]   we're gonna make some money, you get X percentage,
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.820]   I get X percentage, overt.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:41.700]   Covert contract, which is, in my opinion, always bad,
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.160]   would be we're gonna do some work together,
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.280]   you're gonna get a percentage of money,
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.500]   I'm gonna get a percentage of money.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.480]   Could look just like the overt contract,
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.240]   but secretly, I'm resentful that I got the percentage I got,
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.240]   so what I start doing is covertly taking something else.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.800]   What do I take?
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.740]   Maybe I take the opportunity to jab you verbally
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.020]   every once in a while.
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.840]   Maybe I take the opportunity to show up late.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.820]   Maybe I take the opportunity to get to know
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.920]   one of your coworkers so that I might start a business
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.040]   with them, that's covert contracting.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.080]   And you see this sometimes in romantic relationships.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.060]   One person, we won't set the male or female
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.200]   in any direction here and just say,
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.460]   it's I'll make you feel powerful
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.560]   if you make me feel desired.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.340]   Okay, great, there's nothing explicitly wrong
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.320]   about that contract if they both know and they both agree,
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.820]   but what if it's, I'll do that,
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:37.280]   but I'll have kids with you so you feel powerful,
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.260]   you'll have kids with me so I feel desired,
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.920]   but secretly, I don't wanna do that.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.800]   Or one person says, I don't wanna do that, or both don't,
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.780]   so what they end up doing is saying,
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.940]   okay, so I expect something else.
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.040]   I expect you to do certain things for me,
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.200]   or I expect you to pay for certain things for me.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:58.040]   Covert contracts are the signature of everything bad.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.080]   Overt contracts are the signature of all things good.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.100]   And I think about this a lot because I've seen a lot
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.200]   of examples of this.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.360]   Like anyone, we participate in these things,
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.480]   whether or not we want to or not,
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.480]   and the thing that gets transacted the most is,
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.360]   well, I should say the things that get transacted the most
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.420]   are the overt things.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:25.480]   You'll see money, time, sex,
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:33.120]   property, whatever it happens to be, information,
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.680]   but what ends up happening is that when people,
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.080]   I believe, don't feel safe,
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.440]   they feel threatened in some way.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.720]   Like they don't feel safe in a certain interaction.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.760]   What they do is they start taking something else
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.320]   while still engaging in the exchange.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.600]   And I'll tell you, if there's one thing
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.960]   about human nature that's bad, it's that feature.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.640]   Why that feature?
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.080]   Or is it a bugger feature, as you engineers like to say?
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.760]   I think it's because we were allocated a certain extra
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.840]   amount of prefrontal cortex that makes us more sophisticated
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.260]   than a dog, more sophisticated than a chimpanzee,
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.720]   but they do it too.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.720]   And it's because it's often harder to deal with,
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:24.060]   in the short term, to deal with the real sense
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:27.840]   of this is scary, this feels threatening,
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.840]   than it is to play out all the iterations.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.240]   It takes a lot of brain work.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.560]   You're playing chess and go simultaneously,
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.880]   trying to figure out where things are going to end up,
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.000]   and we just don't know.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.560]   So it's a way I think of creating a false sense
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.800]   of certainty, but I'll tell you, covert contracts,
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.800]   the only certainty is that it's going to end badly.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.440]   The question is how badly.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:51.440]   Conversely, overt contracts always end well, always.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.800]   The problem with overt contracts is that you can't be
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.600]   certain that the other person is not engaging
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.480]   in the covert contract.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.320]   You can only take responsibility for your own contracting.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.920]   - Well, one of the challenges of being human
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.440]   is looking at another human being
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.440]   and figuring out their way of being, their behavior,
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.480]   which of the two types of contracts it represents,
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.320]   because they look awfully the same on the surface.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.960]   And one of the challenges of being human,
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.720]   is the decision we all make, is are you somebody
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.320]   that takes a leap of trust and trusts other humans
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.840]   that are willing to take the hurt,
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.280]   or are you going to be cynical and skeptical
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.080]   and avoid most interactions until they,
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.840]   over a long period of time, prove your trust?
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.520]   - Yeah, I never liked the phrase history repeats itself
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.160]   when it comes to humans, because it doesn't apply
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:50.160]   if the people or the person is actively working
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.680]   to resolve their own flaws.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.720]   I do think that if people are willing to do dedicated,
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.980]   introspective work, go into their subconscious,
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.960]   do the hard work, have hard conversations,
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.440]   and get better at hard conversations,
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.040]   something that I'm constantly trying to get better at,
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.720]   I think people can change, but they have to want to change.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.280]   - It does seem like deep down,
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.920]   we all can kind of tell the difference
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.520]   between overt and covert.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.920]   Like we have a good sense.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.120]   I think one of the benefits of having this characteristic
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.480]   of mine where I value loyalty,
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.360]   I've been extremely fortunate to spend most of my life
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.440]   in overt relationships.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.880]   And I think that creates a really fulfilling life.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.840]   - But there's also this thing,
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.440]   and maybe we're in this portion of the podcast now,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.280]   but I've experienced this.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.720]   - I should say that this is late at night we're talking.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.160]   - That's right, certainly late for me, but I'm two hours.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.640]   I came in today on, I'm still in California.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.080]   - And we should also say that you came here
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.240]   to wish me a happy birthday.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.080]   - I did, I did.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.320]   - And the podcast is just like a fun
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.760]   last minute thing I suggested.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.000]   - Yeah, some close friends of yours have arranged a dinner
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.080]   that I'm really looking forward to.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.280]   I won't say which night, but it's the next couple of nights.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.720]   Your circadian clock is one of the most robust features
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.920]   of your biology.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.780]   I know you can be nocturnal or you can be diurnal.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.680]   We know you're mostly nocturnal
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.960]   at certain times of the year, Lex,
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.480]   but very, very few people can get away with no sleep.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.480]   Very few people can get away
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.200]   with a chaotic sleep-wake schedule.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.960]   So you have to obey a 24 hour, aka circadian rhythm
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.280]   if you want to remain healthy of mind and body.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   We also have to acknowledge that aging isn't linear, right?
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.400]   So- - What do you mean?
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.400]   - Well, I mean, the degree of change between years 35 and 40
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.680]   is not going to be the degree of change between 40 and 45.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.240]   But I will say this, I'm 48 and I feel better
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.000]   in every aspect of my psychology and biology now
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.960]   than I did when I was in my 20s.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:59.860]   Yeah, sort of quality of thought, time spent.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:04.860]   Physically, I can do what I did then,
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:06.860]   which probably says more about what I could do then
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.100]   than what I can do now.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.060]   But if you keep training, you can continue to get better.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.220]   The key is to not get injured.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.160]   And I've never trained super hard.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.660]   I've trained hard, but I've been cautious to not,
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.500]   for instance, weight train more than two days in a row.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.380]   I do a split, which is basically three days a week,
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.700]   and the other day is a run, take one full day off,
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.660]   take a week off every 12 to 16 weeks.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.080]   I've not been the guy hurling the heaviest weights
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.540]   or running the furthest distance,
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.620]   but I have been the guy who's continuing to do it
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.620]   when a lot of my friends are talking about knee injuries.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.460]   - Hey, hey, hey.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.020]   - I'm talking about, I'm just.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.740]   (laughing)
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.500]   But of course, with sport, you can't account for everything
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.840]   the same way you can with fitness.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.380]   And I have to acknowledge that.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:50.400]   Unless one is powerlifting, weightlifting and running,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.640]   you can get hurt, but it's not like skateboarding
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.660]   where if you're going for it, you're gonna get hurt.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.200]   That's just, you're landing on concrete.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.400]   And with jiu-jitsu, people are trying to hurt you
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.820]   so that you say, "Stop."
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.220]   So with a sport, it's different.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:10.040]   And these days, I don't really do a sport any longer.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.380]   I work out to stay fit.
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.380]   I used to continue to do sports, but I kept getting hurt.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.700]   And frankly, now, a rolled ankle,
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:25.860]   I may put out a little small skateboard part in 2024
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.900]   because people have been saying,
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.280]   "We wanna see the kickflip."
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.940]   I would say, "Well, I'll do a heel flip instead."
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.540]   But okay, I might put out a little part
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.940]   'cause some of the guys that work on our podcast
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.780]   are from DC.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.940]   I think by now, I should at least do it
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.120]   just to show like I'm not making it up.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.220]   And I probably will.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.100]   But I think doing a sport is different.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:48.400]   That's how you get hurt, overuse and doing an actual sport.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.060]   And so, hat tip to those who do an actual sport.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.660]   - And that's a difficult decision.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.620]   Like a lot of people have to make.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.740]   I have to make with jiu-jitsu, for example.
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.520]   Like if you just look empirically,
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.620]   I've trained really hard for all my life
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:04.180]   in grappling sports and fighting sports
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.700]   and all this kind of stuff.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.340]   And I've avoided injury for the most part.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:13.340]   And I would say, I would attribute that to training a lot.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:18.120]   Sounds counterintuitive, but training well and safely
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.900]   and correctly, keeping good form, saying no
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:23.540]   when I need to say no, but training a lot
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.020]   and taking it seriously.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.140]   Now, when this training is kind of a side,
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:31.620]   really a side thing, I find that the injury
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.380]   becomes a higher and higher probability.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.980]   - But when you're just doing it every once in a while.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:36.820]   - Every once in a while.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.860]   - Yeah, I think you said something really important,
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.380]   the saying no.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.700]   I mean, the times I have gotten hurt training
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:44.620]   is when someone's like,
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:46.140]   "Hey, let's hop on this workout together."
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:48.040]   And it becomes a, let's challenge each other
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.440]   to do something outrageous.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.720]   Sometimes that can be fun though.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.480]   I went up to Cam Haines' gym
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.860]   and he does these very high repetition weight workouts
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.080]   that are in circuit form.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.480]   I was sore for two weeks, but I learned a lot
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.740]   and didn't get injured.
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:05.480]   And yes, we ate bow hunted elk afterwards.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.560]   - Nice.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.920]   But the injury has been a really difficult
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.620]   psychological thing for me 'cause,
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:15.400]   so I've injured my finger, pinky finger,
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.240]   I've injured my knee.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.240]   - Yeah, your kitchen is filled with splints.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.680]   - Splints, I'm trying to figure out.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:26.040]   - It's like, if you look in Lex's kitchen,
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.680]   there's some really good snacks.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.880]   I had some right before.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.160]   He's very good about keeping cold drinks in the fridge
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.320]   and all the water has element in it, which is great.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.160]   I love that.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.320]   But then there's a whole hospital's worth of splints.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.600]   - Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying to figure out.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.600]   So here's the thing.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.620]   You, the finger like pop out like this, right?
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:47.600]   Pinky finger.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.100]   I'm trying to figure out how do I splint in such a way
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.560]   that I can still program, still play guitar,
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.960]   but protect this kind of torque motion
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.200]   that creates a huge amount of pain.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.600]   - It's not so you have a jujitsu injury.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.260]   - Jujitsu, but it's not the kind of,
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.560]   it's probably more like a skateboarding style injury,
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.560]   which is, it's unexpected and a silly thing.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.320]   - It's a thing that happens in a second.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.360]   I didn't break my foot doing anything important.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.200]   - Yeah.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.560]   - I broke my fifth-minute tarp
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.560]   while stepping off a curb.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.400]   - Yep.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.240]   - That's why they're called accidents.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.880]   If you get hurt doing something awesome,
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.120]   that's a trophy that you have to work through.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.640]   It's part of your payment to the universe.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.040]   If you get hurt stepping off a curb
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.360]   or doing something stupid, it's called a stupid accident.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.600]   - Since we brought up "Chimp Empire,"
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.360]   let me ask you about relationships.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.720]   I think we've talked about relationships.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.440]   - Yeah, I only date homo sapiens.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.320]   It's the morning meditation.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.240]   - The night is still young.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.560]   You are human.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.920]   No, but you are also animal.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.040]   Don't sell yourself short.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:55.960]   - No, I always say, listen,
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.160]   any discussion on the "Human Lab" podcast
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.840]   about sexual health or anything,
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.680]   I always, the critical four is consensual,
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.800]   age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.600]   - Species-appropriate, well,
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.720]   can I just tell you about sexual selection?
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.520]   I've been watching "Life in Color" with David Attenborough.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.160]   I've been watching a lot of nature documentaries.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   Talking about inner peace,
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.440]   it brings me so much peace to watch nature.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.080]   At its worst and at its best.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.320]   So "Life in Color" is a series on Netflix
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.560]   where it presents some of the most colorful animals
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.400]   on earth and kind of tells their story
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.680]   of how they got there through natural selection.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.400]   So you have the peacock with the feathers
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.400]   and it's just such incredible colors.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.400]   Like the peacock has these tail feathers, the male,
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.280]   that are like gigantic and they're super colorful
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.960]   and there are these eyes on it.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.120]   It's not eyes, it's like eye-like areas.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.560]   And they wiggle their ass to show the tail.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.520]   They wiggle the tails.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.360]   - The eye spots.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.480]   - The eye spots, yes, thank you.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.360]   You know this probably way better than me.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.280]   I'm just quoting it.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.480]   - No, no, no, please continue.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.360]   - But it was, it's just, I'm watching this
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.120]   and then the female is as boring looking as,
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.240]   like she has no colors or nothing,
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.560]   but she's standing there bored,
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.760]   just seeing this entire display.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.440]   And I'm just wondering, like the entirety of life on earth,
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.880]   or not the entirety, post-bacteria,
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.400]   is like, at least in part, maybe in large part,
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.880]   can be described through this process
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.200]   of natural selection, of sexual selection.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.200]   So dudes fighting and then women selecting.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:39.380]   It seems like, the entirety of that series
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:44.140]   shows some incredible birds and insects and shrimp.
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:45.980]   They're all beautiful and colorful.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:46.820]   - Mantis shrimp.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:47.700]   - Mantis shrimp.
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.260]   They're just, they're incredible.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.060]   And it's all about getting laid.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:54.020]   It's fascinating.
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:58.140]   There's nothing like watching that
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:00.260]   and "Champ Empire" to make you realize,
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:03.100]   we humans, that's the same thing.
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.460]   That's all we're doing.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.740]   And all the beautiful variety,
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.940]   all the bridges and the buildings and the rockets
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.220]   and the internet, all of that is this kind,
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:13.540]   is at least in part, this kind of,
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:17.500]   a product of this kind of showing off for each other.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.900]   And all the wars and all of this.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:22.620]   Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm asking.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.900]   Oh, relationships, yes.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.180]   - Right, before you ask about relationships,
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:31.180]   I think what's clear is that every species, it seems,
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.380]   every animal species wants to make more of itself
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.420]   and protect its young.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:41.900]   - Well, to protect its young is non-obvious.
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:45.020]   - So not destroy enough of itself
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:49.820]   that it can't get more to reproductive competent age.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.540]   I mean, I think that, you know, we have a natural,
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.980]   I mean, healthy people have a natural reflex
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.060]   to protect children.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.780]   - Well, I don't know that.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:01.600]   - And those that can't--
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.100]   - Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.620]   I've seen enough animals that are murdering the children
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:06.700]   of some other--
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.260]   - Sure, there's even siblicide.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:13.180]   First of all, I just wanna say that I was delighted
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.260]   in your delight around animal kingdom stuff
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:18.100]   'cause this is a favorite theme of mine as well.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:22.260]   But there's, for instance, some fascinating data on,
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:25.060]   for instance, for those that grew up on farms,
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:26.780]   they'll be familiar with free martins.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.740]   You know about free martins?
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:33.360]   They're cows that have multiple calves inside them.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:38.080]   And there's a situation in which the calves will secrete,
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.760]   if there's more than one inside,
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:44.400]   will secrete chemicals that will hormonally castrate
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.680]   the calf next to them so they can't reproduce.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   So already in the womb,
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.400]   they are fighting for future resources.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.320]   That's how early this stuff can start.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.520]   So it's chemical warfare in the womb against the siblings.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.900]   Sometimes there's outright siblicide.
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.740]   Siblings are born, they kill one another.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.160]   This also becomes biblical stories, right?
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:09.000]   There are instances of cuttlefish, beautiful cephalopods,
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.420]   like octopuses, and that is the plural as we--
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.420]   - Yeah, that's a meme on the internet.
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.780]   - Oh yeah, that became a meme or a little discussion?
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.300]   - Yeah, it spread pretty quick.
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.000]   And now we just resurfaced it.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.540]   [laughing]
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.860]   - The dismay in your voice is so amusing.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.820]   In any event, the male cuttlefish will disguise themselves
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:34.460]   as female cuttlefish, infiltrate the female cuttlefish group
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:35.660]   and then mate with them.
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:41.860]   All sorts of types of covert operations.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.620]   So I think that--
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.740]   [laughing]
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.340]   It's like a drinking game where every time we say covert
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.100]   contract in this episode,
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.900]   you have to take a shot of espresso.
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.220]   Please don't do that, you'd be dead by the end.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.220]   - So actually just a small tangent,
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.180]   it does make me wonder how much intelligence
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.980]   covert contracts require.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:02.980]   It seems like not much.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.780]   If you can do it in the animal kingdom,
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.540]   there's some kind of instinctual,
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:10.300]   it is based perhaps in fear.
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.440]   - Yeah, it could be simple algorithm.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:16.700]   If there's some ambiguity about numbers
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.540]   and I'm not with these guys,
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:21.340]   and then flip to the alternate strategy.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.180]   I actually have a story about this that I think is relevant.
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.940]   I used to have cuttlefish in my lab in San Diego.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.060]   We went and got them from a guy out in the desert.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.020]   We put them in the lab, it was amazing.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:33.100]   And they had a postdoc who was studying
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.180]   prey capture and cuttlefish.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.860]   They have a very ballistic,
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.820]   extremely rapid strike and grab of the shrimp.
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:42.740]   And we were using high speed cameras
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.360]   to characterize all this.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.220]   Looking at binocular,
[01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.240]   they normally have their eyes on the side of their head.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.100]   When they see something they want to eat,
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.580]   the eyes translocate to the front,
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.820]   which allows them stereopsis,
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.480]   depth perception allows them to strike.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.180]   We were doing some unilateral eye removals,
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.300]   they would miss, et cetera.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.500]   Okay, this has to do with eye spots.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:02.280]   This was during a government shutdown period
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:07.280]   where the ghost shrimp that they normally feed on,
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.460]   that we would ship in from the Gulf down here,
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.460]   weren't available to us.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.020]   So we had to get different shrimp.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:15.980]   And what we noticed was the cuttlefish normally
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.460]   would just sneak up on the shrimp.
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:20.780]   We learned this by data collection.
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.820]   And if the shrimp was facing them,
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:24.420]   they would do this thing with their tentacles
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:27.740]   of kind of enchanting the shrimp.
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:30.300]   And if the shrimp wasn't facing them, they wouldn't do it.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:33.420]   And they would ballistically grab it and eat them.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.300]   Well, when we got these new shrimp,
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:38.460]   the new shrimp had eye spots on their tails.
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.900]   And then the cuttlefish would do this kind of attempt
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.660]   to enchant regardless of the position of the ghost shrimp.
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.500]   So what does that mean?
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.500]   Okay, well, it means that there's some sort of algorithm
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.500]   in the cuttlefish's mind that says,
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.980]   okay, if you see two spots, move your tentacles.
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.340]   So it can be, as you pointed out,
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.660]   it can be a fairly simple operation,
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:58.500]   but it looks diabolical.
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.020]   It looks cunning, but all it is is strategy B.
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:08.420]   - Yeah, but it's still somehow emerged.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:12.940]   I mean, I don't think that calling it an algorithm doesn't,
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.820]   I feel like- - Well, there's a circuit there
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:17.180]   that gets implemented in a certain context,
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.140]   but that circuit had to evolve.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:22.460]   You do realize super intelligent AI will look at us humans
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.340]   and will say the exact thing.
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:27.660]   There's a circuit in there that evolved
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:31.060]   to do this algorithm A and algorithm B,
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.340]   and it's trivial.
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.340]   And to us humans, it's fancy and beautiful
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:36.620]   and we write poetry about it, but it's just trivial.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.980]   - We don't understand the subconscious
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:42.860]   because that AI algorithm cannot see into what it can't see.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.100]   It doesn't understand the under workings
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:48.660]   of what allows all of this conversation stuff to manifest.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.780]   And we can't even see it.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.780]   How could AI see it?
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:51.820]   Maybe it will.
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:55.620]   Maybe AI will solve and give us access to our subconscious.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:59.420]   Maybe your AI friend or coach,
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:02.140]   like I think Andreessen and others are arguing
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:03.780]   is going to happen at some point, is going to say,
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:07.140]   "Hey, you know, Lex, you're making decisions lately
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.460]   that are not good for you,
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.300]   but it's because of this algorithm
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:13.020]   that you picked up in childhood
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:17.220]   that if you don't state your explicit needs upfront,
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.980]   you're not going to get what you want, so why do it?"
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:22.260]   From now on, you need to actually make a list
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:25.340]   of every absolutely outrageous thing that you want,
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.260]   no matter how outrageous,
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:31.220]   and communicate that immediately, and that will work.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.820]   - We're talking about cuttlefish and sexual selection,
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.660]   and then we went into some, where do we go?
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.300]   And you said you were excited.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.020]   - Well, I was excited.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.260]   Well, you were just saying,
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.660]   what about these covert contracts and animals do them?
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:45.540]   I think it's simple contextual engagement
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.900]   of a neural circuit, which is not just nerd speak
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.180]   for saying they do a different strategy,
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.300]   it's saying that there has to be a circuit there,
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:55.500]   hardwired circuit, maybe learned, but probably hardwired,
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.540]   that can be engaged, right?
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:01.740]   You can't build neural machinery out of, in a moment,
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.220]   you need to build that circuit over time.
[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:05.360]   What is building it over time?
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.200]   You select for it.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.220]   The cuttlefish that did not have
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:10.140]   that alternate context-driven circuit
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:14.620]   didn't survive when there was a,
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:17.260]   when all the shrimp that they normally eat disappear,
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.820]   and the eye-spotted shrimp showed up.
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:22.500]   And there were a couple that had some mis-wiring.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.620]   This is why mutation, right, X-Men stuff is real.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:28.860]   They had a mutation that had some alternate wiring,
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.500]   and that wiring got selected for,
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.660]   it became a mutation that was adaptive
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:33.940]   as opposed to maladaptive.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.560]   This is something people don't often understand
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.300]   about genetics, is that it only takes a few generations
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.220]   to devolve a trait, make it worse,
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:46.500]   but it takes a long time to evolve an adaptive trait.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.140]   There are exceptions to that, but most often that's true.
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:52.340]   So a species needs a lot of generations.
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:55.420]   We are hopefully still evolving as a species,
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.260]   and it takes a long time, but,
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.260]   to evolve more adaptive traits,
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:04.140]   but doesn't take long to devolve adaptive traits
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.900]   so that you're getting sicker
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:07.660]   or you're not functioning as well.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:09.380]   So choose your mate wisely,
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:10.680]   and that's perhaps a good segue
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.460]   into sexual selection in humans.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:13.860]   - I could tell you're good at this.
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.460]   (Lex laughing)
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.660]   We said, well, why did I bring up sexual selection?
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.800]   It's the relationships, so sexual selection in humans.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.940]   I don't think you've done an episode on relationships.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:28.340]   - No, I did an episode on attachment,
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:30.940]   but not on relationships.
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:35.780]   The series with Conti includes one episode of the four
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:38.340]   that's all about relational understanding
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:43.340]   and how to select a mate based on matching of drives.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:47.220]   - Oh, the demons inside the subconscious,
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:49.780]   how to match demons, that they dance well together, or what?
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:52.060]   - And how generative two people are.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:52.900]   - What does that mean?
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:56.020]   - Means how, the way he explains it is,
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:00.020]   how devoted to creating growth within the context
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:02.480]   of the family, the relationship with work.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.140]   - Well, let me ask you about mating rituals
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:07.200]   and how to find such a relationship.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.340]   I mean, you're really big on friendships,
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:10.500]   on the value of friendships.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.340]   - I am.
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:15.180]   - And that, I think, extends itself
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:18.980]   into one of the deepest kinds of friendships you can have,
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.300]   which is a romantic relationship.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:26.300]   What mistakes, successes, and wisdom can you impart?
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:32.380]   - Well, I've certainly made some mistakes.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.820]   I've also made some good choices in this realm.
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:39.800]   First of all, we have to define
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.620]   what sort of relationship we're talking about.
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:43.620]   If one is looking for a life partner,
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:46.260]   potentially somebody to establish family with,
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.300]   with or without kids, with or without pets, right?
[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.760]   Families can take different forms.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.380]   I mean, I certainly experienced being a family
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.620]   in a prior relationship where it was the two of us
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.080]   and our two dogs, and then it was like, it was family.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.580]   Like we had our little family.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:00.600]   Um,
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:07.920]   I think based on my experience
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.460]   and based on input from friends
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.220]   who themselves have very successful relationships,
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:20.220]   I must say I've got friends who are in long-term,
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:25.660]   monogamous, very happy relationships
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:30.100]   where there seems to be a lot of love,
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:35.000]   a lot of laughter, a lot of challenge, and a lot of growth.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.580]   And both people, it seems, really want to be there
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.300]   and enjoy being there.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:46.300]   Just to pause on that, one thing to do, I think,
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.060]   by way of advice, is listen to people
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.580]   who are in long-term successful relationships.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:53.900]   That's like, it seems dumb, but like,
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:56.540]   like, oh, we both know and are friends with Joe Rogan,
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.580]   who's been in a long-term, really great relationship,
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.460]   and he's been an inspiration to me.
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.140]   So you take advice from that guy.
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.300]   - Definitely.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.580]   And several members of my podcast team
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:08.780]   are in excellent relationships.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:13.620]   I think one of the things that rings true
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:17.740]   over and over again in the advice and in my experience
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:22.740]   is, you know, find someone who's really a great friend.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:25.780]   Like, build a really great friendship with that person.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:26.940]   Now, obviously not just a friend
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.460]   if we're talking romantic relationship,
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:32.420]   but, and of course, sex is super important,
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:37.140]   but it should be a part of that particular relationship
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.840]   alongside or meshed with the friendship.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:45.320]   Can it be a majority of the positive exchange?
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.620]   I suppose it could,
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:48.620]   but I think the friendship piece is extremely important
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:51.440]   because what's required in a successful relationship,
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.940]   clearly, is joy in being together,
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:57.360]   trust,
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:03.140]   a desire to share experience,
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:07.680]   both, you know, mundane and more adventurous,
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.940]   support each other,
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:11.120]   acceptance,
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.220]   a real,
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:15.860]   maybe even admiration,
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.520]   but certainly delight in being with the person.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.300]   You know, earlier we were talking about peace,
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.940]   and I think that that sense of peace comes from knowing
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.540]   that the person you're in friendship with
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:27.580]   or that you're in romantic relationship or ideally both,
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:28.860]   'cause let's assume healthy relation,
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.140]   the best romantic relationship
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:32.140]   includes a friendship component with that person.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:35.380]   It's like you just really delight in their presence,
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:36.940]   even if it's a quiet presence,
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:43.740]   and you delight in seeing them delight in things, right?
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:44.860]   That's clear.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:48.940]   The trust piece is huge, you know,
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:51.260]   and that's where people start,
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.660]   you know, we don't want to focus on what works,
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:53.500]   not what doesn't work,
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.020]   but that's where I think people
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.020]   start engaging these covert contracts.
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:00.920]   They're afraid of being betrayed, so they betray.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:05.260]   They're afraid of giving up too much vulnerability,
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:08.020]   so they hide their vulnerability,
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:11.240]   or in the worst cases, they feign vulnerability.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.540]   Again, that's a covert contract
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.100]   that just simply undermines everything.
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.940]   It becomes one plus one equals two minus one to infinity.
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:22.060]   Conversely, I think if people
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.580]   can have really hard conversations,
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:26.220]   this is something I've had to work really hard on
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:28.500]   in recent years that I'm still working hard on,
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.380]   but the friendship piece seems to be the thing
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.740]   that rises to the top when I talk to friends
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:37.180]   who are in these great relationships.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:40.260]   It's like they have so much respect and love
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:43.740]   and joy in being with their friend.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.180]   It's the person that they want to spend
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:46.420]   as much of their non-working,
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:50.140]   non-platonic friendship time with,
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.980]   and the person that they want to experience things with
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:53.820]   and share things with.
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.240]   And it sounds so kind of canned and cliche nowadays,
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.620]   but I think if you step back and examine
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.960]   how most people go about finding a relationship,
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.620]   sort of like, "Oh, am I attracted?"
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:05.620]   Of course, physical attraction is important
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.580]   and other forms of attraction too.
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:10.280]   And they sort of enter through that portal,
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.420]   which makes sense.
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:13.260]   That's the mating dance, right?
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.080]   That's the peacock situation.
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.860]   That's hopefully not the cuttlefish situation.
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:24.500]   But I think that there seems to be a history
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:28.480]   of people close to me getting into great relationships
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.620]   where they were friends for a while first,
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:33.600]   or maybe didn't sleep together right away,
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.220]   that they actually intentionally deferred on that.
[01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:41.100]   This has not been my habit or my experience.
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.820]   I've gone the more, I think, typical,
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:46.300]   like, "Oh, there's an attraction, like this person,
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.140]   there's an interest."
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.280]   You kind of explore all dimensions
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.560]   of relationship really quickly,
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.980]   except perhaps the moving in part
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:53.520]   and the having kids part, which ideally,
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.380]   because it's a bigger step,
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:58.360]   harder to undo without more severe consequences.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:02.520]   But I think the whole take it slow thing,
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.960]   I don't think is about getting to know someone slowly.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.420]   I think it's about that physical peace,
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:10.220]   because that does change the nature of the relationship.
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.440]   And I think it's because it gets right
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.820]   into the more hardwired primitive circuitry
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.440]   around our feelings of safety, vulnerability.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:26.260]   There's something about romantic and sexual interactions
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:30.940]   where it's almost like, it's like assets and liabilities,
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.820]   right, where people are trying to figure out
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:36.440]   how much to engage their time and their energy
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.580]   and multiple, I'm talking about from both sides,
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:41.440]   male, female, or whatever sides,
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.500]   but where it's like assets and liabilities.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.220]   And that's where it starts getting
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:50.460]   into those complicated contracts early on, I think.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:51.720]   And so maybe that's why,
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:54.140]   if a really great friendship and admiration
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:56.540]   is established first,
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.820]   even if people are romantically and sexually attracted
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.760]   to one another, then that piece can be added in
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:04.900]   a little bit later in a way that really kind of just seals
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:05.720]   up the whole thing.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:06.560]   And then who knows,
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.260]   maybe they spend 90% of their time having sex.
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:13.260]   I don't know, that's not for me to say or decide, obviously,
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:17.740]   but there's something there about staying out
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.860]   of a certain amount of risk
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:26.660]   of having to engage covert contract
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:29.060]   in order to protect oneself.
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:30.680]   - But I do think like,
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:37.540]   love at first sight, this kind of idea is in part
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:41.940]   realizing very quickly that you are great friends.
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:45.580]   Like I've had that experience of friendship recently.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.040]   It's not really friendship, but like,
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.100]   oh, you get each other with humans,
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:51.980]   not in a romantic setting.
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:52.820]   - Right, friendship.
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:53.660]   - Yeah, just friendship.
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:55.860]   - Well, dare I say, I felt that way about you
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:56.700]   when we met, right?
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:34:00.860]   I was like, this dude's cool and he's smart and he's funny
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:05.440]   and he's driven and he's giving and he's got an edge
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.440]   and I wanna learn from him, wanna hang out with him.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.580]   I mean, that was the beginning of our friendship
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:17.020]   was essentially that set of internal realization.
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:17.860]   - Just keep going, just keep going.
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.460]   - And a sharp dresser.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.140]   - Yeah, yeah, just looks great shirtless on a horseback.
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:24.420]   - No, no, no, listen, I mean,
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.020]   despite what some people might say on the internet,
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.300]   it's a purely platonic friendship.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:31.820]   - Somebody asked if Andrew Kuperman has a girlfriend
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:33.460]   and somebody says, "I think so."
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:38.460]   And the third comment was, "This really breaks my heart
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:42.600]   "that Alex and Andrew are not an item."
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.200]   - We are great friends, but we are not an item.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.200]   - Yeah, well. - It's true, it's official.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:52.440]   I hear over and over again from friends
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.760]   that have made great choices and awesome partners
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.200]   and have these fantastic relationships
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.480]   for long periods of time that seem to continue to thrive.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:02.320]   At least that's what they tell me
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.720]   and that's what I observe.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:06.720]   Establish the friendship first
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.160]   and give it a bit of time before sex.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.160]   And so, I think that's the feeling, that's the feeling.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.920]   And we're talking micro features and macro features.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:24.280]   We're talking, and this isn't about perfection,
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.600]   it's actually about the imperfections,
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:26.520]   which is kind of cool.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.960]   I like quirky people, I like characters.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.520]   I'll tell you where I've gone badly wrong
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.780]   and where I see other people going badly wrong.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:38.120]   If there is no rule that says that you have to be attracted
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.180]   to all attractive people, by any means.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.600]   It's very important to develop a sense of taste
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.480]   in romantic attractions, I believe.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:51.000]   What you really like in terms of a certain style,
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.840]   a certain way of being.
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.020]   And of course that includes sexuality
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.080]   and sex itself, the verb.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.120]   But I think it also includes
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.240]   their just general way of being.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.680]   And when you really adore somebody,
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.640]   you like the way they answer the phone.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.040]   And when they don't answer the phone that way,
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.080]   you know something's off and you want to know.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:18.080]   And so I think that the more you can tune up
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.600]   your powers of observation,
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.400]   not looking for things that you like,
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.080]   and the more that stuff just kind of washes over you,
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.880]   the more likely you are to quote unquote fall in love.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.640]   As a mutual friend of ours said to me,
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:33.640]   listen, when it comes to romantic relationships,
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   if it's not 100% in you, it ain't happening.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.840]   And I've never seen a violation of that statement
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.920]   where it's like, yeah, it's mostly good.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.360]   And there's this, there's like the negotiations.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.960]   Well, already it's doomed.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.380]   And that doesn't mean someone has to be perfect.
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.600]   The relationship has to be perfect,
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.360]   but it's got to feel 100% inside.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.400]   It's like, yes, yes, and yes.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.360]   I think Dyseroth when he was on here,
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.520]   your podcast mentioned something that,
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.840]   I think the words were,
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.240]   or maybe it was in his book, I don't recall,
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.340]   but that love is one of these things
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.400]   that we story into with somebody.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.320]   We create this idea of ourselves in the future
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:18.280]   and we look at our past time together
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.220]   and then you story into it.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.680]   I mean, there are very few things like that.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.960]   I can't story into building flying cars.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.520]   I have to actually go do something.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.520]   I mean, yeah, and love is also retroactively constructed.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.060]   I mean, anyone who's gone through a breakup
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.680]   understands the grief of knowing,
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:39.020]   ah, like this is something I really shouldn't be in
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.840]   for whatever reason, 'cause it only takes one.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.200]   If the other person doesn't want to be in it,
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.280]   then you shouldn't be in it.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.800]   But then missing so many things,
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:49.100]   and that's just the attachment machinery really at work.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.920]   - I have to ask you a question that somebody
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:54.080]   on our amazing team wanted to ask.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.600]   He's happily married.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.920]   Another, like you mentioned, incredible relationship.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:37:59.960]   - Are they good friends?
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.200]   - Are they amazing friends?
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.040]   - There you go.
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:06.040]   - But I'm not saying who it is, so I can say some stuff,
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:10.840]   which is it started out as a great sexual connection.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:11.680]   - Oh, well, there you go.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.320]   - But then became very close friends after that.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.720]   - Listen. - There you go.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.240]   So speaking of sex. - Many paths to roam.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.920]   - He has a wonderful son and he's wanting
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:22.640]   to have a second kid, and he wanted to ask
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.640]   the great Andrew Huberman, is there sexual positions
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.200]   or any kind of thing that can help maximize the chance
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.440]   that they have a girl versus a boy?
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.880]   'Cause they had a wonderful boy, they want a girl.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.240]   Is there a way to control the gender?
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.800]   - Well, this has been debated for a long time,
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.120]   and I did a four and a half hour episode on fertility.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:46.920]   And the reason I did a four and a half hour episode
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.600]   on fertility is that, first of all,
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:52.240]   I find that reproductive biology fascinating,
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:57.200]   and I wanted a resource for people that were thinking about
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.280]   or struggling with having kids for whatever reason.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.340]   And it felt important to me to combine the male
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:05.300]   and female components in the same episode.
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:06.960]   It's all timestamped, so you don't have to listen
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:07.800]   to the whole thing.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.080]   We talk about IVF and mutual fertilization,
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.400]   and we talk about natural pregnancy.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.000]   Okay, the data on position is very interesting,
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.200]   but let me just say a few things.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.200]   There are a few clinics now, in particular,
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:24.200]   some out of the United States that are spinning down sperm
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.540]   and finding that they can separate out fractions,
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:28.680]   as they're called, that can spin the sperm down
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.420]   at a given speed, and they'll separate out
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:34.400]   at different sort of depths within the test tube
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:39.120]   that allow them to pull out the sperm on top or below
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.440]   and bias the probability towards male or female births.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.440]   It's not perfect, it's not 100%,
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.840]   it's a very costly procedure,
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.760]   but it's still very controversial.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.000]   Now, with in vitro fertilization, you can extract eggs,
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.200]   you can introduce a sperm directly by pipette,
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.520]   it's a process called ICSI,
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.840]   or you can set up a sperm race in a dish.
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:01.080]   And if you get a number of different embryos,
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.160]   meaning the eggs get fertilized,
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.280]   duplicate and start formoblasticis,
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.400]   which is a ball of cells, early embryo,
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.160]   then you can do karyotyping.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.040]   So you can look for XX or XY, select the XY,
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.320]   which then would give rise to a male offspring
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.240]   and implant that one.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.880]   So there is that kind of sex selection.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:25.000]   With respect to position, there's a lot of lore
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.920]   that if the woman is on top or the woman's on the bottom,
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.720]   or whether or not the penetration is from behind,
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.680]   whether or not it's gonna be male or female offspring,
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.200]   and frankly, the data are not great, as you can imagine,
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:43.200]   'cause those would be interesting studies to run, perhaps.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.160]   - There is study, there is paper.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.000]   - There are some-- - But they're not, I guess,
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.520]   there's more lore than science.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.520]   - And there are a lot of other variables
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.720]   that are hard to control.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.080]   So for instance, if it's ejaculation during intramission,
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.600]   during sex penetration, et cetera,
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.000]   then you can't measure, for instance, sperm volume,
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.920]   as opposed to when it's IVF,
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.520]   and they can actually measure how many milliliters,
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.880]   how many forward motile sperm.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.120]   It's hard to control for certain things.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.480]   And it just can vary between individuals
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.520]   and even from one ejaculation to the next.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.480]   And okay, so there's too many variables.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:20.400]   However, the position thing is interesting
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.960]   in the following way, and then I'll answer
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.680]   whether or not you can bias towards a female.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.520]   But as long as we're talking about sexual--
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.160]   - I have other questions about sex.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.980]   - But as long as we're talking about sexual position,
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:35.560]   there are data that support the idea
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.560]   that in order to increase the probability
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:42.640]   of successful fertilization,
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.640]   that indeed the woman should not stand up right after sex,
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:52.120]   and should right after the man has ejaculated inside her,
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.000]   and should adjust her pelvis, say, 15 degrees upwards.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.360]   I mean, some of the fertility experts, MDs,
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.360]   will say that's crazy, but others that I sought out,
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.800]   and not specifically for this answer,
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.760]   but for researching that episode,
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.240]   said that, yeah, what you're talking about
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:14.320]   is trying to get the maximum number of sperm,
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.800]   and it's contained in semen,
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.400]   and yes, the semen can leak out.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:21.200]   And so keeping the pelvis tilted for about 15 degrees
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:24.120]   for about 15 minutes, obviously tilted in the direction
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.880]   that would have things running upstream, not downstream,
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.000]   so to speak.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.300]   - Gravity. - Gravity, it's real.
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:36.360]   So for maximizing fertilization,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.600]   the doctors I spoke to just said,
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:42.040]   look, given that if people are trying to get pregnant,
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.500]   what is spending 15 minutes on their back,
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.680]   this sort of thing?
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.900]   Okay, so then with respect to female,
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:55.900]   getting a female offspring, or XX female offspring,
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:43:01.560]   selectively, there is the idea that as fathers get older,
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:04.440]   they're more likely to have daughters as opposed to sons.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.280]   That's a, from the papers I've read,
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.560]   is a significant, but still mildly significant result.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.920]   So with each passing year,
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.400]   this person increases the probability
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.960]   they're gonna have a daughter, not a son.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:19.800]   So that's interesting.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.040]   - But the probability differences are probably tiny.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.480]   - I mean, it's not, you know, it's a significant,
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.260]   it's not trivial, it's not a trivial difference.
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:33.200]   But if they want to ensure having a daughter,
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:37.520]   then they should do IVF and select an XX embryo.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.320]   And when you go through IVF,
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:42.800]   they genetically screen them for karyotype, which is XXXY.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.920]   And they look at mutations, genotypic mutations,
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:52.200]   for things like, you know, trisomies and aneuploidies,
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.000]   all the stuff you don't want.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.920]   - But there is a lot of lore, if you look on the internet.
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.520]   - Sure, different foods.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.560]   - So there are a lot of variables.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.400]   - There's a lot of variables,
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.760]   but there haven't been systematic studies.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.880]   So I think probably the best thing to do,
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.040]   unless they're gonna do IVF, is just, you know,
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.000]   roll the dice.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.440]   And, you know, I think with each passing year,
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.640]   they increase the probability of getting a female offspring.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.680]   But of course, with each passing year,
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.440]   the egg and sperm quality degrade.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.020]   So, you know, get after it soon.
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:25.520]   - So I went down a rabbit hole.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.680]   There's like sexology, there's journals.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:29.680]   - Oh yeah. - On sex.
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.680]   - Sure.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:31.520]   - Okay, so I--
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.620]   - And some of them, not all, quite reputable.
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.480]   - Yeah.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:39.720]   - Some of them really pioneering in the sense that
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:43.040]   they've taken on topics that are, you know,
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.240]   considered, you know, outside the main frame
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.600]   of what people talk about, but they're very important.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.780]   We have episodes coming out soon with, for instance,
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:55.000]   the head of male urology, sexual health,
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.120]   and reproductive health at Stanford, Michael Eisenberg,
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.720]   but also, you know, one with a female urologist,
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:05.080]   sexual health, reproductive health, Dr. Rina Malik,
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.900]   who has a quite active YouTube presence.
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:12.900]   She does these really dry, like scientific presentation,
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.640]   but very nice.
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.840]   She has a lovely voice, but she'll be talking about,
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.200]   you know, erections or squirting or like all this.
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:23.260]   She does very kind of internet type content,
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:25.440]   but she's a legitimate urologist,
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.040]   reproductive health expert.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:30.160]   And in the podcast, we did talk about
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.060]   both male and female orgasm.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.180]   We talked a lot about sexual function, dysfunction.
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:37.640]   We talked a lot about pelvic floor.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.640]   One interesting factoid is that only three,
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:47.240]   only 3% of sexual dysfunction is hormonal,
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.780]   endocrine in nature.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.320]   It's more often related to some pelvic floor
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:58.040]   or vasculature, blood flow related or other issue.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.480]   And then when Eisenberg came on the podcast,
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.220]   he said that far less sexual dysfunction
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:07.600]   is psychogenic in origin than people believe,
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.120]   that far more of it is pelvic floor, neuro and vascular.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.740]   So, you know, there are the myths of,
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.980]   I mean, it's not saying that it's,
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:17.080]   that psychogenic dysfunction doesn't exist,
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.820]   but that a lot of the sexual dysfunction
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:21.720]   that people assume is related to hormones
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:24.320]   or that is related to psychogenic issues
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:27.560]   are related to vascular or neural issues.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:30.400]   And the good news is that there are great remedies
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:31.280]   for those.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.880]   And so those, both those episodes detail
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.560]   some of the more salient points
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.840]   about what those remedies are and could be.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.480]   I mean, one of the kind of, again, factoids,
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.680]   but it was interesting that, you know,
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:45.040]   a lot of people have pelvic floor issues
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.960]   and they think that their pelvic floors
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:49.640]   are quote unquote messed up.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:50.480]   So they go on the internet,
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:52.640]   they learn about Kegels, Kegels, you know,
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.240]   and it turns out that some people need Kegels.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.760]   They need to strengthen their pelvic floor.
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.280]   Guess what?
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.160]   A huge number of people with sexual
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:05.160]   and urologic dysfunction have pelvic floors
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.040]   that are too tight and Kegels are going to make them
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.960]   far worse and they actually need to learn
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.200]   to relax their pelvic floor.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.320]   And so seeing a pelvic floor specialist is important.
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.000]   I think in the next five, 10 years,
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.080]   we're going to see a dramatic shift
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.800]   towards more discussion about sexual
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.520]   and reproductive health in a way that acknowledges
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.200]   that yeah, the clitoris comes from the same origin tissue
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.580]   as the penis.
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:27.920]   And in many ways, the neural innervation of the two,
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.360]   while clearly different, has some overlapping features
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:36.360]   that there's going to be discussion around kind of anatomy
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.720]   and hormones and pelvic floors
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:43.720]   and in a way that's going to erode some of the kind
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:46.400]   of like cloaking of these topics
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.040]   'cause they've been cloaked for a long time.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:51.200]   And there's a lot of like, well, let's just call it what is.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.120]   There's a lot of bullshit out there about what's what.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.760]   And now the hormonal issues, by the way,
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.160]   just to clarify, can impact desire.
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.800]   So a lot of people who have lack of desire
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:05.980]   as opposed to lack of anatomical function,
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.140]   this could be male or female,
[01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:10.880]   that that can originate with either things like SSRIs
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.100]   or hormonal issues.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.400]   And so we talk about that as well.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.080]   So it's a pretty vast topic.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.560]   - Okay, you're one of the most productive people I know.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:22.280]   What's the secret to your productivity?
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:24.960]   How do you maximize the number of productive hours
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.780]   in a day?
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:27.440]   You're a scientist, you're a teacher,
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.160]   you're a very prolific educator.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.500]   - Well, thanks for the kind words.
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:34.640]   I struggle like everybody else,
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.640]   but I am pretty relentless about meeting deadlines.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:45.720]   I miss them sometimes, but sometimes that means cramming,
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.840]   sometimes that means starting early.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.680]   But--
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:51.200]   - Has that been hard, sorry to interrupt with the podcast?
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.580]   There's certain episodes,
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.080]   I mean, you're like taking just incredibly difficult topics
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:00.820]   and you know there's going to be a lot
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:03.320]   of really good scientists listening to those
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:05.320]   with a very skeptical and careful eye.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.460]   Do you struggle meeting that deadline sometimes?
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:11.700]   - Yes, we've pushed out episodes
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.340]   because I want more time with them.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:15.420]   I also, I haven't advertised this,
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:19.780]   but I have another fully tenured professor
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:24.440]   that started checking my podcasts
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:27.000]   and helping me find papers.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:27.920]   He's a close friend of mine,
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:30.680]   he's an incredible expert in neuroplasticity
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:31.980]   and that's been helpful.
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:35.420]   But I do all the primary research for the episodes myself.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:38.960]   Although my niece has been doing a summer internship
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:40.800]   with me and finding amazing papers.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.040]   She did last summer as well.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.100]   She's really good at it.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:45.680]   Just sick that kid on the internet
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.840]   and she gets great stuff.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:50.820]   - Can I ask you, just going on tangents here,
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:53.720]   what's the hardest, finding the papers
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.440]   or understanding what a paper is saying?
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:59.240]   - Finding the best papers.
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.320]   Yeah, 'cause you have to read a bunch of reviews,
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.080]   figure out who's getting cited,
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.480]   call people in a field, make sure that this is the stuff.
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:09.160]   I mean, I did this episode recently on ketamine,
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.120]   about ketamine, I wasn't on ketamine.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:15.000]   And there's this whole debate about S versus R ketamine,
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.560]   SR ketamine, and I called two clinical experts
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.320]   at Stanford, I had a researcher at UCLA help me.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:23.080]   Even then, a few people had gripes about it.
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:24.680]   I don't think they understood a section
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.080]   that I was perhaps could have been clearer about.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.680]   But yeah, you're always concerned that people
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:34.160]   won't either won't get it or I won't be clear.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.960]   So the researching is mainly about finding the best papers.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:39.920]   And then I'm looking for papers that establish
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:42.000]   a thoroughness of understanding
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.580]   that are interesting, obviously.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.820]   It's fun to get occasionally look at some of the odder
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:50.700]   or more progressive papers that are,
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:52.740]   what's new in a field, and then where there are
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:55.700]   actionable takeaways to really export those
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:57.420]   with a lot of thoughtfulness.
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:01.240]   I mean, I think that going back to the productivity thing,
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.700]   I do, I get up, I look at the sun,
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:07.780]   I don't stare at the sun, but I get my sunshine.
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:09.260]   It all starts with a really good night's sleep.
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:11.300]   I think that's really important to understand.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:13.740]   So much so that if I wake up and I don't feel rested enough,
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:16.380]   I'll often do a non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:18.580]   or go back to sleep for a little bit, get up,
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:22.220]   really prioritize one, the big block of work
[01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:23.780]   for the thing that I'm researching.
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:25.180]   I think a little bit of anxiety
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:27.780]   and a little bit of concern about deadline helps.
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:30.720]   Turning the phone off helps.
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:35.940]   Realizing that those peak hours, whenever they are for you,
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:38.860]   you do not allow those hours to be invaded
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.500]   unless there's a nuclear bomb goes off.
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:47.420]   And a nuclear bomb is just a phraseology for,
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:52.660]   it could be family crisis would be a good justification.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:56.680]   There's an emergency obviously, but it's all about focus.
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.520]   It's all about focus in the moment.
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:01.620]   It's not even so much about how many hours you log,
[01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:02.820]   it's really about focus in the moment.
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:05.420]   How much total focus can you give to something?
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:08.660]   And then I like to take walks and think about things
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:11.300]   and sometimes talk about them in my voice recorder.
[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:14.260]   So I'm just always churning on it all the time.
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:19.380]   And then of course, learning to turn it off
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.620]   and engage with people socially
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:24.900]   and not be podcasting 24 hours a day in your head is key.
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:27.300]   But I think I love learning and researching
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:29.860]   and finding those papers and the information
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:30.820]   and I love teaching it.
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:33.160]   And these days I use a whiteboard.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.480]   Before I start, I don't have any notes, no teleprompter.
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.540]   Then the whiteboard that I use beforehand
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:40.820]   is to really sculpt out the different elements
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:44.580]   and the flow, get the flow right and move things around.
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:46.140]   The whiteboard is such a valuable tool.
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:48.380]   Then take a couple of pictures of that
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:50.380]   when I'm happy with it, put it down on the desk.
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:51.780]   And these are just bullet points
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:54.140]   and then just churn through and just churn through
[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:57.500]   and nothing feels better than researching
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.700]   and sharing information.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:02.420]   And as you did, you grew up writing papers
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:05.380]   and it's hard and I like the friction of like,
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:08.300]   "Ugh, I want to get up, I want to use the bathroom."
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:12.020]   When I was in college, I was trying to make up deficiencies
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:14.980]   from my lack of attendance in high school
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:17.500]   so much so that I would set a timer
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:20.340]   I wouldn't let myself get up to use the bathroom even.
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:22.500]   Never had an accident, but I was, you know,
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.580]   I mean, it was like, I listened to music,
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:27.540]   classical music, rancid, a few other things,
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:29.980]   some Bob Dylan maybe thrown in there
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:34.740]   and just study and it felt,
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:37.220]   and then you hit the two hour mark and you're in pain
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:38.380]   and then you get up and you're like,
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:40.660]   "Use the bathroom," like that felt so good.
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:42.100]   There's something about the human brain
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.460]   that likes these kinds of friction points
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:45.740]   and working through them
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:46.780]   and you just have to work through them.
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:51.060]   So yeah, I'm productive and my life is arranged around it.
[01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:53.400]   And, you know, that's been a bit of a barrier
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.440]   to personal life at times,
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.380]   but my life's been arranged around it.
[01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:00.180]   I've set up everything so that I can learn more,
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:05.180]   teach more, including, you know, some of my home life.
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:09.700]   But I do, you know, still watch "Chimp Empire."
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:11.240]   I still got time to watch "Chimp Empire."
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:14.100]   Look, the great Joe Strummer, right?
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.980]   Clash, they were my favorite Mescaleros.
[01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:17.900]   He said, you know, the famous Strummer quote,
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:20.340]   "No input, no output."
[01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:24.340]   So you need experience, you need outside things
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:27.820]   in order to foster the process.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:32.300]   But yeah, just nose to the grindstone, man.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:33.140]   I don't know.
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:35.780]   And that's what I'm happy to do with my life.
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:38.100]   I don't think anyone should do that just because,
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:40.660]   but this is how I'm showing up.
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:43.460]   And, you know, if you don't like me, then scroll.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:45.140]   Why do they say swipe left, swipe right?
[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:45.980]   I don't know.
[01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:47.580]   I'm not on the apps, the dating apps.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.940]   So that's the other thing.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.260]   I keep waiting for when,
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:54.260]   listens to Lex Freeman podcasts as a checkbox
[01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:56.380]   on like Hinge or Bumble or whatever it is.
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:58.100]   But I don't even know, are those that are field?
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:00.300]   'Cause I don't know what are the apps now.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:01.580]   - I've never used an app.
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:04.980]   And I always found it troublesome
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:07.460]   how little information is provided on apps.
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:09.460]   - Well, they're the ones that are like a stock lake,
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:11.300]   like Raya, you know?
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:13.420]   It's like they sort of like,
[01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:16.980]   companies will actually fill them with, you know,
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:18.740]   people that look a certain way.
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:20.820]   - Well, soon it'll be filled with AI.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.300]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:23.940]   - That's what you said, oh.
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:25.940]   There's a heartbreak within that.
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:27.340]   - Well, I, you know, I'm guilty
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:29.360]   of liking real human interaction.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.520]   - Have you tried AI interaction?
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:36.860]   - No, but I have a feeling you're gonna convince me to.
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:38.660]   - One day.
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:43.900]   Yeah, I've also struggled finishing projects that are new,
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:46.380]   that are something new.
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:48.020]   Like for example, one of the things
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:51.260]   I really struggled finishing is something that's in Russian
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:53.300]   that requires translation and overdub
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.620]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:57.220]   The other project I've been working on for like over,
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:59.460]   at least a year,
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:03.140]   off and on, but trying to finish
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:04.620]   is something we've talked about in the past
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:08.340]   is I'm still on it, a project on Hitler in World War II.
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:10.180]   I've written so much about it.
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:11.860]   And I just don't know why I can't finish it.
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:14.360]   I have trouble like really,
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.340]   I think I'm terrified being in front of the camera.
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.660]   - Like this? - Like this.
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:21.780]   - Or solo? - Well, actually, no, no, no.
[01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:22.860]   Solo.
[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:24.740]   - Well, if ever you wanna do solo,
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:26.560]   seriously, 'cause we've done this before, right?
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:29.700]   Our clandestine study missions.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:31.620]   I'm happy to sit in the corner and work on my book
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:32.860]   or do something if you wanna,
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:33.700]   if it feels good to just have someone in the room.
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:35.420]   - Just for the feeling of somebody else?
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:36.420]   - Definitely. - Well, what do you,
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:38.800]   I mean, how do you, you don't seem to,
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:42.540]   you seem to have been fearless
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:44.580]   to just sit in front of the camera
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:48.020]   by yourself to do the episode.
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:48.900]   - Yeah, it was weird.
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:50.620]   I mean, the first year of the podcast,
[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:51.820]   it just spilled out of me.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:54.260]   It was just, I had all that stuff I was so excited about.
[01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:56.660]   I've been talking to everyone who would listen
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:57:01.660]   and anyone, even when they'd run away, I'd keep talking.
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:04.740]   Before there was ever a camera, wasn't on social media.
[01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:06.700]   2019, I posted a little bit, 2020, as you know,
[01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:07.740]   I started going on podcasts.
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:09.740]   But yeah, I had so, I just,
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:14.380]   I just, the zest and delight in this stuff.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:15.460]   It's like circadian rhythms,
[01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:16.420]   I'm gonna tell you about this stuff.
[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:18.300]   I just felt like here was the opportunity
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.860]   and just let it burst.
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:21.700]   And then as we've gotten into topics
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:25.500]   that are a little bit further away from my home knowledge,
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:30.980]   I still get super excited about it.
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:33.180]   It's music in the brain episode
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.500]   I've been researching for a while now.
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:36.340]   I'm just so hyped about it.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:37.900]   It's so, so interesting.
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:39.020]   There's so many facets,
[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:43.180]   singing versus improvisational music,
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.900]   versus I'm listening to music,
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:47.180]   versus learning music.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:48.740]   I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:51.460]   There's just so much that's so interesting.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:52.900]   I just can't get enough.
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:56.140]   And I think, I don't know, you put a camera in front of me,
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:57.460]   I sort of forget about it.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:01.020]   And I'm just trying to just teach.
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:02.580]   - Yeah, so that's the difference, that's interesting.
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.660]   I mean, I-- - Forget the camera.
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.340]   - Maybe I need to find that joy as well.
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:09.100]   But like for me, a lot of the joy is in the writing.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:11.940]   And the camera, there's something--
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:13.740]   - Well, the best lecturers, as you know,
[01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:15.460]   and you're a phenomenal lecturer,
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:17.100]   so you embody this as well.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:18.900]   But when I teach at Stanford,
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:21.340]   I was directing this course in neuroanatomy and neuroscience
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:22.500]   and for medical students,
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:25.160]   and I noticed that the best lecturers would come in
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:26.500]   and they're teaching the material
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.980]   from a place of deep understanding,
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:33.060]   but they're also experiencing it as a first-time learner
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:34.380]   as at the same time.
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:36.500]   So it's just sort of embodying the delight of it,
[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.940]   but also the authority over the, not authority,
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.460]   but the sort of mastery of the material.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:43.740]   And it's really the delight in it
[01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:45.460]   that the students are linking onto.
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:47.100]   And of course, they need and deserve
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:48.740]   the best accurate material.
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.140]   So they have to know what they're talking about.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:53.260]   But yeah, just tap into that energy of learning
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:56.260]   and loving it and people are along for the ride.
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.140]   Or, you know, I get accused of being long-winded,
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:01.300]   but you know, things get taken out of context,
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:03.040]   that leads to greater misunderstanding.
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:04.420]   And also I look at, listen,
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:07.020]   I come from a lineage of three dead advisors,
[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:09.620]   three, all three.
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:12.740]   So I don't know when the reaper's coming for me.
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:14.640]   I'm doing my best to stay alive a long time,
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.420]   but whether or not it's a bullet or a bus
[01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:20.260]   or cancer or whatever, or just old age,
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:24.820]   I mean, I'm trying to get it all out there as best I can.
[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:26.380]   And if it means you have to hit pause
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.620]   and come back a day or two later,
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:30.260]   like that seems like a reasonable compromise to me.
[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:33.960]   I'm not going to go longer than I need to.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:35.620]   And I'm trying to shorten them up.
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:39.700]   But again, that's kind of how I show up.
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:42.020]   It's like Tim Armstrong would say about writing songs.
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:43.420]   I asked him, do you write, how often do you write?
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:45.300]   Every day, every day.
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.700]   Was Rick ever stopped creating?
[01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:47.540]   No.
[01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:48.780]   Has Joe ever stopped preparing for comedy?
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:51.940]   Are you ever stopping to think about world issues
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:54.340]   and technology and who you can talk to?
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:58.300]   I mean, it seems to me you've always got a plan inside.
[01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:01.620]   The thing I love about your podcast the most,
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:04.660]   to be honest, these days, is the surprise of like,
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:06.420]   I don't know who the hell's going to be there.
[02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:10.180]   It's almost like I get a little nervously excited
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.060]   about when a new episode comes out,
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:14.780]   'cause I have no idea, no idea.
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:16.560]   And I mean, I have some guesses
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:17.800]   based on what you told me during the break.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:20.420]   I mean, you've got some people where it's just like,
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.740]   whoa, Lex has went there?
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:25.900]   Awesome, can't wait, click.
[02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:28.460]   I think that's really cool.
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:30.300]   Like you're constantly surprising people.
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:33.100]   So you're doing it so well.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:34.780]   Like it's such a high level.
[02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:38.140]   And I think it's also important for people to understand
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:42.260]   that what you're doing, Lex, there's no precedent for it.
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:43.620]   Sure, there've been interviews before,
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:46.120]   there've been podcasts before, there're discussions before,
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.660]   but it's not like, how many of your peers can you look to
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:51.580]   to find out how best to do the content like yours?
[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:52.540]   Zero.
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:54.660]   There's one peer, you.
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:59.100]   And so, that should give you great peace
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:02.700]   and great excitement because you're a pioneer.
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:04.580]   You're literally the tip of the spear.
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:06.680]   I don't want to take an unnecessary tangent,
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.300]   but I think this might thread together
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:09.620]   two of the things that we've been talking about,
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:12.160]   which are, I think, of pretty key importance.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:13.960]   One is romantic relationships,
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:16.380]   and the other is creative process and work.
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:18.560]   And this, again, is something I learned from Rick,
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.420]   but that he and I have gone back and forth on,
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:23.500]   and that I think is worth elaborating on,
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:25.780]   which is, earlier we were saying,
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:27.780]   the best relationship is gonna be one
[02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:29.900]   where it brings you peace.
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:32.700]   I think peace also can be translated to,
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:36.240]   among other things, lack of distraction.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:38.080]   So, when you're with your partner,
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.140]   can you really focus on them and the relationship?
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:47.140]   Can you not be distracted by things that you're upset about
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:51.820]   from their past or from your past with them?
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:54.540]   And, of course, the same is true for them, right?
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:56.580]   They ideally will feel that way towards you, too.
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:58.120]   They can really focus.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:02.540]   Also, when you're not with them, can you focus on your work?
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:05.900]   Can you not be worried about whether or not they're okay
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:07.260]   'cause you trust that they're an adult
[02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:08.140]   and they can handle things
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:11.020]   or they will reach out if they need things?
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:13.720]   They're gonna communicate their needs like an adult,
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:16.220]   not creating messes just to get attention
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:17.620]   and things like that.
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:21.020]   Or disappearing, for that matter.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:26.020]   So, peace and focus are intimately related
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:31.360]   and distraction is the enemy of peace and focus.
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:34.700]   So, there's something there, I believe,
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:38.140]   because with people that have the strong generative drive
[02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:41.700]   and want to be productive in their home life,
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:43.740]   in the sense of have a rich family life
[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:45.420]   or partner life, whatever that is,
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:47.580]   and in their work life,
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:49.220]   the ability to really drop into the work
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:51.660]   and like, okay, you might have that sense,
[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:52.540]   like I hope they're okay
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:54.940]   or need to check my phone or something,
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:56.860]   but just know we're good.
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:59.020]   So, peace and focus, I think,
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:01.580]   and being present are so key.
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.740]   And it's key at every level of romantic relationship
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:07.240]   from certainly presence and focus,
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:12.240]   everything from sex to listening to raising a family,
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:14.320]   to tending to the house.
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:17.820]   And in work, it's absolutely critical.
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:21.300]   So, I think that those things are kind of mirror images
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:22.460]   of the same thing
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:25.180]   and they're both important reflections of the other.
[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:26.300]   And when you start to just,
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:28.680]   you know, when work is not going well,
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:33.680]   then the focus on relationship can suffer and vice versa.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:35.700]   - And it's crazy how important that is.
[02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:41.260]   How incredibly wonderful it could be
[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:42.860]   to have a person in your life
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:47.220]   that kind of enables that creative focus.
[02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:50.640]   - Yeah, and you supply the peace and focus
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:53.180]   for their endeavors, whatever those might be.
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:55.900]   I mean, that symmetry there,
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:57.980]   because clearly people have different needs
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:59.820]   and the need to just really trust,
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:01.540]   you know, like when Lex is working,
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:06.540]   he's in his generative mode and I know he's good.
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:11.020]   And so, then they feel sure they've contributed to that,
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:13.740]   but then also what you're doing is supporting them
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:15.540]   in whatever way it happens to be.
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:17.180]   And I think that sometimes you'll see that,
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:19.140]   people will pair up along creative creative
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:22.380]   or musical musical or computer scientists.
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:25.780]   But I think, again, going back to this Conte episode
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:29.640]   on relationships is that the superficial labels
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:31.020]   are less important, it seems,
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:34.120]   than just the desire to create that kind of home life
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:36.000]   and relationship together.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.460]   And as a consequence, the work mode,
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:43.020]   and for some people, both people aren't working
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:43.900]   and sometimes they are,
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:47.020]   but I think that's the good stuff, you know?
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:49.260]   And I think that's the big learning in all of it
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:52.660]   is that the further along I go with each birthday,
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:54.180]   I guarantee you're gonna be like,
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:56.260]   "What I want is simpler and simpler
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:05:01.260]   "and harder and harder to create, but oh, so worth it."
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:04.460]   - The inner and the outer peace.
[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:08.700]   It's been over two years, I think,
[02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:10.280]   since Costello passed away.
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:12.540]   - Still tears me up.
[02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:15.500]   I cried about him today.
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:16.700]   Cried about him today.
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:21.060]   It's proportional to the love,
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:22.900]   but yeah, I'll cry about it right now if I think about it.
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:23.980]   It wasn't putting him down,
[02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:26.140]   it wasn't the act of him dying, any of that.
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:28.740]   Actually, that was a beautiful experience.
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:30.300]   I didn't expect it to be,
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:32.300]   but it was in my place when I was living in Topanga
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:34.340]   during the pandemic where we launched the podcast
[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:38.380]   and I did it at home and he hated the vets,
[02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:41.420]   I did it at home and he gave out this huge,
[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:43.820]   (sighs)
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:45.140]   right at the end.
[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:47.300]   And I could just tell he had been in just
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:48.620]   not a lot of pain, fortunately,
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:52.300]   but he had just been working so hard just to move it all.
[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:54.100]   And the craziest thing happened,
[02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:55.260]   like it was unbelievable.
[02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:56.980]   I've never had an experience like this.
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:05:59.180]   I expected my heart to break
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:00.740]   and I've felt a broken heart before.
[02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:04.060]   I felt it, frankly, when my parents split.
[02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:07.140]   I felt it when Harry shot himself.
[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.260]   I felt it when Barbara died.
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:11.980]   I felt it when Ben went.
[02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:16.980]   So as well, and so many friends, like way too many friends.
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:20.680]   I mean, end of 2017, my friend Aaron King,
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:24.840]   Johnny Fair, John Eichelberry,
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.740]   stomach cancer, suicide, fentanyl.
[02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:30.340]   It's like, whoa, all in a freaking week.
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:32.840]   And I just remember thinking like, what the,
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:35.980]   but when it just heartbreak and you just carry that
[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:40.060]   and it's like, ah, but, and that's just a short list.
[02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:42.220]   And I don't say that for sob stories,
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:43.660]   just for a guy that wasn't in the military
[02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:44.860]   or didn't grow up in the inner city.
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:47.300]   Like it's an unusual number of like deaths,
[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:48.440]   like close people.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:54.260]   When Costello went, the craziest thing happened.
[02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:56.940]   My heart warmed up, like heated up.
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.220]   And I wasn't on MDMA and I wasn't,
[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:03.420]   I was just, just the moment he went, he just went, whoosh.
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:05.780]   And I was like, what the hell is this?
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:08.460]   And it was just, it was like a supernatural experience
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:09.660]   to me, I just never had that.
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:11.060]   I put my grandfather in the ground.
[02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:12.380]   I was a pallbearer at the funeral.
[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:14.740]   I've like done that more times than I'd like to,
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:17.140]   to have ever done it.
[02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:20.220]   And it just heated up with Costello.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:22.140]   And I thought, what the fuck is this?
[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:24.080]   And it was almost like, and you can make up these,
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:25.720]   we make up these stories about what it is,
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:28.500]   but it was almost like, he was like, all right,
[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:31.100]   I have to be careful 'cause I will cry here.
[02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:32.440]   And I don't want to.
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:37.300]   It was almost like he was like, all that effort,
[02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:39.180]   'cause I put in putting so much effort into him.
[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:41.180]   I was like, all right, you get that back.
[02:07:41.180 --> 02:07:44.300]   It was like the giant frigging thank you.
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:46.340]   And it was incredible, you know,
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:48.260]   and I'm not embarrassed to shed a tear or two about it
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:50.740]   if I have to, like, I was like, holy shit.
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:53.380]   Like, that's how close I was to that animal.
[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:55.940]   - Where do you think, where do you think you can find
[02:07:55.940 --> 02:07:57.060]   that kind of love again?
[02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:58.420]   - Man, I don't know.
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:01.480]   I mean, when, and excuse me for welling up,
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.680]   but it was just, I mean, it's a frigging dog, right?
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:04.620]   I get it.
[02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:09.160]   But for me, it was the first real home I ever had.
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:13.380]   But when Costello went, it was like,
[02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:15.860]   we'd had this home in Topanga, we'd set it up,
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:17.900]   and we're like, and he was just so happy there.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:21.460]   And I think it just, I don't know,
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:25.900]   it was like this weird, like victory slash massive loss.
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:28.260]   Like, we did it, 11 years.
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:32.420]   We can did everything, everything to make him
[02:08:32.420 --> 02:08:33.380]   as comfortable as possible.
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:35.140]   And he was super loyal, beautiful animal,
[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:37.860]   but also just funny and fun.
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:39.980]   And I was like, I did it.
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:43.540]   Like, I gave as much of myself to this being
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:47.380]   as a human, I felt I could without making it,
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:51.180]   like detracting from the rest of my life.
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:52.840]   And he loved, and so I don't know.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:55.760]   When I think about Barbara, especially,
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:59.900]   I well up and it's hard for me, but I mean,
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:01.260]   I talked to her before she died
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:02.760]   and that was a brutal conversation,
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:06.160]   saying goodbye to someone, especially with kids.
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:08.980]   And that was hard.
[02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:15.600]   I think that really flipped a switch in me
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.540]   where I'm like, I always knew I wanted kids.
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:19.140]   I say, I want kids, I want a lot of kids.
[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:20.500]   That flipped a switch in me.
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:22.820]   I was like, I want kids, I want my own kids.
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:24.460]   - You might be able to find that kind of love.
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:26.740]   - Yeah, I think, 'cause it was the caretaking.
[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:29.600]   It wasn't about what he gave me all that time.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:31.020]   And the more I could take care of him
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:33.060]   and see him happy, the better I felt.
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:34.220]   It was crazy.
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:36.260]   And I don't know.
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:40.540]   So I miss him every day, every day.
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.140]   I miss him every day.
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:45.940]   - You got a heart that's so full of love.
[02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:48.180]   I can't wait for you to have kids.
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:49.020]   - Thanks, man.
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:50.140]   - For you to be a father.
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:50.980]   - Yeah, well-- - I can't wait to--
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:55.980]   - When I'm ready for it, when God decides I'm ready,
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:57.340]   I'll have 'em.
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:01.340]   And then I will still beat you to it,
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:03.140]   as I told you many times before.
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:07.900]   - I think you should absolutely have kids.
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:10.020]   I mean, look at the people in our life.
[02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:11.820]   'Cause we're kind of the,
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:13.100]   in case you haven't realized it already,
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:17.040]   like we're the younger of the podcasters.
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:22.040]   But you know, like Joe and Peter and Sagura
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:26.100]   and the rest, right?
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:29.140]   They're like the tribal elders, right?
[02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:32.660]   And we're not the youngest in the crew,
[02:10:32.660 --> 02:10:36.660]   but if you look at all those guys,
[02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:38.500]   they all have kids.
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:41.140]   They all adore their kids.
[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:43.860]   And their kids bring tremendous meaning to their life.
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:48.860]   Like we'd be morons if you didn't go off and start a family.
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:52.080]   I didn't start a family.
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:55.540]   And yeah, I think that's the goal.
[02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:58.620]   I mean, I think of the goals, that's one of them.
[02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:01.900]   - Kids not only make their life more joyful
[02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:03.220]   and brings love to their life,
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:04.520]   it also makes them more productive,
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:05.900]   makes them better people, all that.
[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:09.220]   It's kind of obvious.
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:11.340]   - Yeah, I think that's what Costello wanted.
[02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:12.740]   I think I have this story in my head
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:15.060]   that he was just like, "Okay, take this."
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:15.900]   - Yeah.
[02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:16.720]   - Yeah.
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:19.120]   - And don't fuck this up. - It was a good test.
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:21.580]   - Lord knows, don't fuck this up.
[02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:23.020]   - Andrew, I love you, brother.
[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:23.860]   This was an incredible conversation.
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:24.700]   - Love you too.
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:26.860]   - I appreciate you.
[02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:29.220]   - We will talk often on each other's podcast
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:30.380]   for many years to come.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:31.220]   - Yes.
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:32.060]   - Many, many years to come.
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:32.880]   - Thank you.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:34.140]   Thanks for having me on here.
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:37.460]   And there are no words for how much I appreciate
[02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:38.860]   your example and your friendship.
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:40.140]   So love you, brother.
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:40.980]   - Love you too.
[02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:43.740]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:44.980]   with Andrew Huberman.
[02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:46.060]   To support this podcast,
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:48.620]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:52.700]   And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:54.260]   In the midst of winter,
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:58.140]   I found there was within me an invincible summer.
[02:11:58.140 --> 02:11:59.580]   And that makes me happy,
[02:11:59.580 --> 02:12:01.540]   for it says that no matter how hard
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:03.340]   the world pushes against me,
[02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:06.060]   within me, there's something stronger,
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:10.220]   something better, pushing right back.
[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:13.180]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:15.760]   (upbeat music)
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:18.340]   (upbeat music)
