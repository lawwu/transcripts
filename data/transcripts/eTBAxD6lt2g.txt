[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.680]   this is a
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:56.120]   Rohan. The following is a conversation with my dear friend, Andrew Huberman. His fourth time on this podcast. It's my birthday. So this is a special birthday episode of sorts. Andrew flew down to Austin just to wish me a happy birthday. And we decided to do a podcast last second. We literally talked for hours beforehand. And a long time after, late into the night. He's one of my favorite human beings, brilliant scientists, incredible teacher, and a loyal friend.

[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.640]   I'm trying to run a little bit more. Are you losing weight? I'm not trying to lose weight, but I always do the same fitness routine for like 30 years, basically lift three days a week, run three days a week. But one of the runs is a long run, one of them is medium, one of them is a sprint type thing. So what I've decided to do this year was just extend the duration of the long run.

[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:51.020]   a little bit higher, which is not to say that people who lift heavy are done, but I think it's interesting to see how training differently changes your cognition. I think it also is interesting to see how training differently changes your cognition. That's probably hormone related, you know, hormones downstream of training heavy versus hormones downstream of training a little bit lighter. I think my cognition is better when I'm doing more cardio and when the repetition ranges are a little bit higher, which is not to say that people who lift heavy are done.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.900]   esta difficult

[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.680]   So yeah, I've been playing with the variables in a pretty systematic way.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.880]   Well, I like long and slow
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.720]   for, like you said, the impact it has on my cognition.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.620]   Yeah, it's the wordlessness of it.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.460]   The way it puts you in in the way it seems to clean out the clutter.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.500]   Yeah, you know, it can take away
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:59.320]   go
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.740]   depend. I never,,,,
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:06:11.800]  oko Kostello: Yeah. And I'd bring my bulldog Kostello. Bulldog master at the time and he was a slow walker. So these were slow walks, but I can think much more clearly that way. There's a Nobel Prize winning professor at Columbia University School of Medicine, Richard Axel, who won the Nobel Prize, co-won Nobel Prize with Linda Buck for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction and he walks and voice dictates his papers.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   Mm hmm.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:39.460]   And now with Rev or these other, maybe there are better ones than Rev where you can convert audio files into text very quickly and then edit from there. So I will often voice dictate first drafts and things like that. And I totally agree on the long runs, the walks, integrating that with cognitive work. Harder to do with sprints and then the gym. You know, are you weight trained? You seem naturally strong and like thicker jointed.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:49.340]   permit
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:07:06.540]   hard . anyhow,,,,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.220]   It's like a little bit of a long list of all the comments that I missed. Oh yeah, those are great. That's what I miss about Rogan being on YouTube with the full length of the comments. So this is technically a birthday podcast. What do you love most about getting older? It's like the confirmation that comes from getting more and more data, which basically says, yeah, the first time you thought that thing, it was actually right because the second, third and fourth and fifth time.

[00:12:32.860 --> 00:13:01.620]   People say about the brain, which is most people say, oh, the supercomputer of the brain is the forebrain. It's like a monkey brain with a extra real estate put on there. And the forebrain is what makes us human. And gives us our superpowers. Paul has said, and he's done a whole series on mental health that's coming out.

If you work with somebody really good, they're forcing you to ask questions about who you really are, what you really want. It's not just about support, but there should be support, there should be rapport, but then it's also there should be insight. Most people who get therapy, they're getting support, there's rapport, but insight is not easy to arrive at, and a really good psychologist or psychiatrist can help you arrive at deep insight.

[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.700]   That it works through us.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:06.080]   And so I do a prayer, I'll just describe it, where I ask, I make an ask to help remove
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.560]   my defects, my character defects.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:15.480]   I pray to God to help remove my character defects so that I can show up better in
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:19.140]   all the roles of my life and do good work.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:19.560]   Which for me is a great thing.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:19.560]   00:15:15.720,00:15:18.720 I think it's a great thing.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:19.560]   00:15:18.720,00:15:21.720 I think it's a great thing.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   And so you might say, well, how is that different than a meditation?
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   Well, I'm acknowledging that there is something that's bigger than me, bigger than nature, as I understand it, that I cannot understand or control, nor do I want to.

[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:38.680]   Um, but I, so that was part of it. I was still developing, but you know, how to get your body stronger, how to build endurance, but no one told me the information wasn't there. So a lot of what I put out there is the information that
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:38.680]   I wish I had had the information.
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:57:07.620]  , I wish I had had because once I had it, I was like, wow, like a, this stuff really works. B it's grounded in something real, you know, some place, sometimes certain protocols are a combination of, you know, animal, human and animal and human studies, sometimes clinical trials. Sometimes there's some mechanistic conjecture for some, not all I always make clear, which but in the end, like, figuring out how things work so that we can be happier, healthier, more productive, suffer less.

[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:10.200]   So what does he do?
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.240]   So what does he do? He takes the whole troop on a raid to another troop and sees who will fight for him and who won't.

[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:38.480]   So it's very interesting and it gets to something I hope we'll have an opportunity to talk about because it's something that I'm obsessed with lately is this notion of overt versus covert contracts right there are overt contracts where you change work for money or you exchange any number of things in an overt way.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.580]   so it's very interesting and it gets to something I hope we'll have an opportunity to talk about because it's something that I'm obsessed with lately is this notion of overt versus covert contracts right there are overt contracts where you change work for money or you exchange any number of things in an overt way.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:39.640]   so it's very interesting and it gets to something that I hope will have an opportunity to talk about because it's something that I'm obsessed with lately is this notion of overt contracting of this notion of overt contracting of behavior for species that normally we don't think of course of this is this one of behavior of behavior.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:03:09.640]  , but then there are covert contracts and those take on a very different form and always lead to in my belief bad things well how much of human and chimp relationships are over versus covert well here's one thing that we know is true dogs and humans the dog to human relationship is 100% overt they don't manipulate you now you could say they do in the sense that they learn that if they look a certain way or roll on their back they get food.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:19.760]  ,

[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.720]   I'm going to get a percentage of money.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.520]   Could look just like the overt contract, but secretly, I'm resentful that I got
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.620]   the percentage I got.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:59.620]   So what I start doing is covertly taking something else.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:00.620]   What do I take?
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.620]   Maybe I take the opportunity to jab you verbally every once in a while.

[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:22.820]   there's something about
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:27.440]   uh romantic and sexual interactions where it's almost like
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.200]   it's like assets and liabilities
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:33.820]   right where people are trying to figure out how much to

[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:28.420]   And so I think it also includes there's just general way of being, you know, and when you really adore somebody, you like the way they answer the phone. And when they don't answer the phone that way, you know something's off and you want to know. And so I think that the more you can tune up your powers of observation, not looking for things that you like, and the more that stuff just kind of washes over you, the more likely you are to quote unquote fall in love.

[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:08.840]   Then you can't measure for instance sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF and they can actually measure how many milliliters how many forward motile sperm

[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:40.020]   So at, with each passing year, this person increases the probability they're gonna have a daughter, not a son. So that's interesting. But the probability differences are probably tiny. I mean, it's, it's not, you know, it's a significant, it's not trivial, a trivial difference. But if they want to ensure having a daughter, then they should do IVF and select an XXM embryo. And when you go through IVF, they genetically screen them for karyotype.

[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:05.300]   underway and you know there's going to be a lot of really good scientists listening to those with a very skeptical and careful eye.
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:09.360]   Like how hard, you struggle meeting that deadline sometimes?
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:13.100]   Yeah so we've pushed out episodes because I want more time with them.
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:26.900]   I also, I haven't advertised this but I have another fully tenured professor that's started checking my podcasts and helping me find papers.
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:27.720]   He's a close friend of mine.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:47.220]  , he's an incredible expert in neuroplasticity and that's been helpful. But I research all my, I do all the primary research for the episodes myself. Although my niece has been doing a summer internship with me and finding amazing papers. She did last summer as well. She's really good at it. Just stick that kid on the internet and she gets great stuff.
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:56.000]   Can I ask you, just going on tangents here, what's the hardest, finding the papers or understanding what a paper is saying?
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:56.720]   Finding the papers.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:57.220]   Finding the papers.

[01:49:59.300 --> 01:49:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:06.560]   Because you have to, you know, read a bunch of reviews, figure out who's getting cited, call people in the field, make sure that this is the stuff.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.060]   I mean, you know, I did this episode recently on ketamine, about ketamine, I wasn't on ketamine.
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:15.960]   And, you know, there's this whole debate about S versus R ketamine, SR ketamine.
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.140]   And I called two clinical experts at Stanford.
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:20.380]   I had a researcher at UCLA help me.
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:23.180]   Even then, you know, a few people had gripes about it.
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:27.000]   I don't think they understood a section that I was, perhaps could have been clearer about.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:27.720]   Okay.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:27.720]   I don't think they understood a section that I was perhaps could have been clearer about.

[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:27.720]   I think that, going back to the productivity thing, I do, I get up, I look at the sun, I don't stare at the sun, but I get my sunshine, it all starts with a really good night's sleep. I think that's really important to understand. I think that's really important to understand. So much so that if I wake up and I don't feel rested enough, I'll often do it non-sleep deep breath, yoga nidra or go back to sleep for a little bit, get up, really prioritize one, the big block of work for the thing that I'm researching. I think a little bit of anxiety and a little bit of concern about deadline helps.
