[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.760]   - Pastor John, we have an increasing amount of questions
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.000]   coming in from missionaries out in the field,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.440]   and this is one from Brent, who's in China.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.940]   He asks, quote, "Can a missionary lie
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.360]   "in order to do ministry in a closed or persecuted country?
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.420]   "For example, can he sign a statement saying
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.440]   "he agrees to obey the laws of that country
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.740]   "when he actually plans to break some of them,
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.360]   "particularly religious-based ones," end quote.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.260]   What would you say to him, Pastor John?
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.600]   - I would say no.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.080]   I don't think you should lie
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.400]   in order to get into a country,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   especially something as blatant as signing a statement
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.020]   that you intend to do what you don't intend to do.
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.840]   Now, having said that, the reason I say that
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   is because I think that kind of distortion of reality
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.440]   and manipulation of the facts
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.760]   will undermine your witness,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.480]   it will undermine your courage,
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.120]   it will undermine the Lord of truth that you serve,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.760]   and will probably backfire pretty profoundly.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.100]   However, here's the less clear part.
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.000]   There are other issues in how a person describes
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.660]   what they're doing in a country,
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.520]   because unbelievers cannot grasp entirely
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.620]   the real meaning of gospel grace,
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.680]   the real meaning of what you're there for,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.960]   so that there are things that you're gonna say
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.680]   they're not gonna be able to grasp,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.280]   and in a sense, then, you're not telling them
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.800]   all that's true because they can't grasp all that's true.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.920]   If you say, "I am here to bless your people,
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.200]   "to love your people, to do good to your people,"
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.960]   you mean both the physical things
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.000]   and the spiritual realities,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.040]   and they may not be able to grasp that whole package,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.920]   and I don't think it would be wrong
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.720]   to say something like that.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   So I don't want to be naive
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.360]   about the kinds of things that need to be said
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.760]   by missionaries that are true,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.520]   and yet not able to communicate the whole truth
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.720]   to an unbeliever who, even if he used different words
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.680]   about salvation, wouldn't even know
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.940]   what you were talking about.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.120]   They wouldn't be able to grasp that.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.960]   - Thank you, Pastor John,
