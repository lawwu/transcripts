[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.640]   We got one here from Andrew, writing all the way from Australia.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.360]   He says, "Morning, Cal. I started my PhD late last year,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.800]   and stumbling on your books and podcasts has helped me focus and work deeper.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.360]   I love trail running and doing Ironmans,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.400]   but I'm struggling to permit myself to continue training and competing in these
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.280]   while undertaking the biggest deep work of my life so far, my PhD.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.560]   Can I do both or should I just focus on the PhD?"
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.840]   Andrew, I think you should do both.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.520]   Do not inflate the PhD in your
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.640]   mind to be this incredibly difficult hell week at Navy
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.840]   Seal training, you know,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.600]   taking the beach at Normandy type of massive trial that
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.800]   some people do and say, this is, you know, a relatively easy job.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400]   I have some classes and the classes are done,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.480]   and then I'm mainly focused on research and research is hard,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.440]   but it only takes up so much of your time each day.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.000]   So I say do the hardcore athletic training,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.880]   if anything is going to help balance you out so that when you get worn out
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.960]   intellectually, your confidence gets shaken. Oh man,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800]   I'm not getting this. My paper got rejected. You have something else to do.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.000]   And so do those two things. For most programs, again,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.280]   a PhD program is not this huge life consuming type of position.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.480]   I know this in part because when I was writing about student stuff,
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.560]   PhD student myself, and I was writing about a lot of student stuff,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.880]   I had noticed there was this disturbing subculture of people at this point,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.120]   largely blogging, sort of pre-social media,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.040]   blogging about life as a grad student.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.840]   And they would inflate it into this like terrible thing that was the hardest
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   burden that anyone would ever do.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.240]   And these things had titles like dissertation hell,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.960]   and you would read these things and you would think,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.400]   you would think that these students had been deployed to war torn countries in
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.920]   which they had to run life threatening commando raids through terrible
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.080]   conditions or something like this.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.000]   And what I finally figured out was happening is that being a doctoral student,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.840]   A, is a really weird job. It's not like a normal job.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.560]   There's big periods where you don't have much to do or the things you do is
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.080]   non-standard. It's not people giving you tasks to accomplish.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   You don't have a nine to five schedule that makes a lot of people uncomfortable.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.720]   Like, is this really a job I have?
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.400]   So by inflating it to be this big hard thing,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.520]   I think it somehow helps people counter that feeling of like,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.840]   I don't really have a real job. So I thought that was part of it.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.640]   Another part of it is there is an anxiety or intellectual insecurity that a lot
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.040]   of people rightly would suffer from. When I say rightly,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   I mean it's justified because it's a weird world.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.800]   It's a job that's all about your brain and people posturing who's smarter and
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.760]   it helps you feel better.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.640]   I can justify this anxiety I'm feeling about intellectual issues,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.120]   like can I keep up or whatever,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.920]   by just describing what I'm going through as this big,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.080]   terrible thing in general. And then your anxiety makes sense.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   But I'm going to say resist that. It's a pretty easy job.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.440]   Pretty easy job. And again, I wrote
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.160]   two, I wrote two books during my PhD,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.760]   two books during my PhD that had nothing to do with my PhD,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.800]   just as something to do on the side.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.080]   And I ran study hacks where we were doing three posts a week back then.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.600]   And I was still bored because it's kind of a fake job.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.000]   So Andrew, keep training for Ironman at the same time.
