[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.640]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.360]   with John Piper.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.840]   Yesterday we talked here about Satan's very first impulse
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.520]   for sin and where it originated.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.060]   Today Josh in Australia writes in with a short and simple
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.200]   but pretty profound question.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.800]   And it's this, Pastor John, should I hate Satan?
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.720]   And does God himself hate Satan?
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.120]   How should we feel about Satan?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.920]   Is hatred too strong?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.340]   Let's begin as so often with a definition.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.040]   I can't get anywhere without a definition.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.600]   What exactly is hate or hatred?
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.500]   When we're considering love, it's the flip side, and hate,
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.860]   we need to remember that both of them are used
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.100]   in two fairly distinct ways.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480]   For example, love may mean being pleased
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.440]   with the loveliness and the beauty of something.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.220]   So I might say, "I love that painting,"
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.240]   or "I love it when you treat your little brother that way."
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.880]   But there's the other kind of love,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.120]   which regardless of whether the object is lovely
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.120]   or pleasing, chooses, desires to seek the benefit
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.840]   of the person or the thing that is loved.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.280]   So Jesus requires that we love our enemies,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.880]   and these enemies may be very unlovely and morally corrupt
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.100]   and extremely displeasing to us.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.820]   So the second kind of love still holds.
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.900]   We treat them better than they deserve.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.200]   We seek their good.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's the same way, flip it around,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.520]   it's the same way with hatred.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.760]   It can mean intense disapproval or dislike
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.400]   for what is evil or ugly or distasteful,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.040]   as when I say, "I hate mushrooms," or "I hate abortion."
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.600]   But on the other hand, as with love,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.760]   hatred can refer to an intense desire or choice
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   that someone would suffer, would be judged,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.640]   or that they'd be ruined or destroyed.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.520]   So when we talk about hating Satan,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   I think it's right to say that we should hate Satan
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.320]   in both of these senses,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.280]   and that God himself hates Satan in both of these senses.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.320]   And there are at least two reasons why I say this.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.040]   Number one is that the scriptures teach
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   that God hates the wicked and the impenitent people
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.800]   in both senses.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   And the Bible also shows that there comes a point
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.780]   where we should properly join him
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.560]   in at least some sense of hating the wicked,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.840]   as God is hating them in that way,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.640]   not only being strongly displeased,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.640]   but also in rare cases, willing their judgment.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.960]   So that's the first reason.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   And the second reason I think he hates Satan
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.440]   in both those senses, and we should,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.360]   is that Satan is beyond repentance.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.000]   And so the desire for his conversion
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   is never considered virtuous or even present in the Bible.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.120]   So let me illustrate the point
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120]   that's really controversial, I'm sure,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.400]   that I'm arguing from God's hatred of people
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.080]   to his hatred of Satan,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.400]   'cause the Bible never says God hates Satan,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.280]   but it clearly implies it, I think.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.060]   So Hebrews 1:8 says that the Son of God,
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.320]   it says about him, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.200]   "The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   "You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness."
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.560]   So we know that God and his Son hate wickedness.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.960]   Similarly, we, those who fear God,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.920]   join him in the hatred of what is evil.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.240]   The fear of the Lord, this is Proverbs 8:13,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.700]   "The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil,
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.800]   "pride and arrogance and the way of evil
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   "and perverted speech I hate."
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.240]   And Romans 12:9 says, "Abhor what is evil."
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.060]   And so it is with wicked and impenitent people,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.220]   not just action.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.280]   So we've just seen that we're supposed to hate action,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.380]   'cause nobody would disagree with that, probably.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.380]   "The Lord may choose to set his face against evildoers
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.860]   "temporarily or eternally and do them no injustice.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.800]   "He owes us nothing.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.680]   "We deserve only punishment
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.160]   "because of the universal sinfulness of the human race."
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160]   So we read, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated," Romans 9:13,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.960]   or Psalm 5:4, "You are not a God who delights in wickedness.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.680]   "You hate all evil doers."
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   Or Psalm 11:5, "The Lord tests the righteous,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.880]   "but his soul hates the wicked."
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.820]   Or Psalm 2:4, "He sits in heavens and laughs.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.400]   "The Lord holds them in derision."
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.880]   So the Bible gives examples
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.240]   of not only God hating the wicked,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.280]   but the psalmist themselves, the human writers,
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.960]   under God's inspiration,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.640]   expressing the same hate of evil doers.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.920]   These are sometimes called imprecatory psalms.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.780]   And contrary to what I think,
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.240]   some Bible teachers say
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.840]   they're really not part of God's inspired word,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.840]   and they were used and loved
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.440]   by people who didn't understand.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.080]   But I say, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.720]   "They were used and loved by Jesus and by Paul,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.340]   "especially Psalm 69,
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.420]   "one of the most severe imprecatory psalms,
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.120]   "and both Jesus and Paul cited it as exemplary
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   "and embraced it as part of what they thought."
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.420]   So we have, for example, Psalm 31,6,
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.700]   "I hate those who pay regard to worthless idols,
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.360]   "but I trust in the Lord."
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.780]   Or Psalm 119,113, "I hate the double-minded,
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.320]   "but I love your law."
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.240]   Or Psalm 139,21, "Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord?
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.080]   "And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.560]   "I hate them with utmost hatred."
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.280]   Now, some of these psalms
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.300]   may be expressions of God himself,
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.440]   or the Messiah, speaking through the psalmist.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.160]   So these are like messianic psalms
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.520]   with the psalmist assuming the role of God
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.020]   or of the Messiah as he speaks.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.600]   So we have to be very careful how to apply
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.200]   the right to pronounce judgment ourselves,
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.980]   that that aspect may be fitting for them
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.000]   and not always fitting for ourselves.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.600]   So in the light of all these texts and others, I say,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.600]   since Satan is the source and embodiment of all wickedness,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.660]   God and the godly should indeed hate him,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.700]   meaning both in the sense of intense disapproval
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.700]   and in the sense of intense desire for his judgment
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.420]   and dispatching out of history and out of influence
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.980]   into the lake of fire.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.100]   And I think this is confirmed
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.900]   by the fact that Satan is beyond repentance.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.900]   And never in the Bible is any thought
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.160]   of praying for Satan or wishing for Satan's conversion
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.800]   mentioned or considered virtuous.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.140]   One of the reasons I think we're commanded in Romans 12, 9
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.240]   to abhor what is evil and hold fast to what is good
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.460]   is that you really can't love the good without hating evil.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.240]   In order to hold fast to what is good
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.840]   and cherish the good and want the good to prevail
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.740]   and want people to experience good,
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.180]   you must hate what is evil
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:43.180]   and you must hate the one whose heart is impenitent
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.780]   and the fountain of all evil.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.780]   Not to hate an impenitent, evil fountain of evil
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.420]   is not to love the good.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.720]   So yes, I think God hates Satan in both of those senses
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   and I think we should too.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.840]   - Wow, thank you Pastor John
