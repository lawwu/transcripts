[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   The reason that the PayPal story, at least my version of it, has so much failure in it
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.360]   is because, like, if we pretend that they're not superheroes for a minute, if we bring
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.880]   them back down to earth, if we tell the stories of, like, accidentally hot-swapping hard drives
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.520]   and almost losing the company's entire source code, right, it makes it okay for many other
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.560]   people to do the kinds of work that they do.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.000]   Okay.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.080]   I'm super excited about this one.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.040]   Today I'm interviewing Jimmy Soni.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.160]   He's the author of Rome's Last Citizen, a biography of Cato, A Minded Play, a biography
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.720]   of Cloud Shannon, and most recently, he's the author of The Founders, The Story of PayPal,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.880]   and The Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.440]   So Jimmy, let's just jump into it.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.080]   So your previous book was about Cloud Shannon, and he comes up with information theory while
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.080]   he's working at Balab's.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.520]   This is a place that's famously comfortable, they have a monopoly from the government,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.440]   and then so the scientists, they have time, they have freedom, they're not pressured by
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.440]   competition.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.760]   And on the other hand, you have, obviously, as you talk about, six Nobel Prizes, transistor,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.760]   laser, Unix-y.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.500]   On the other hand, you have PayPal.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.520]   They're constantly on the verge of going under incredible pressure, long hours, and this
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.320]   is also a place that produces tremendous amounts of innovation.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.960]   How do these different places promote innovation?
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:46.040]   Yeah, it's a great question, and it is interesting to think about just how different they are.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.040]   It's a great question, and actually, it's a very big question, because in some ways,
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.860]   the right person to answer the Balab's question is probably John Gertner, who did the quintessential
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.860]   book on Balab's.
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.980]   It's called The Idea Factory.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.300]   I was looking at one person in that stew in that era, and that was Shannon.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.220]   Here's what I would say about Shannon's innovations.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.140]   So Shannon worked on information theory, not because he was working at Balab's.
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.500]   He actually was working at Balab's and was tooling with information theory as a side
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   hustle.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.560]   He didn't call it a side hustle, because we didn't have that lingo, but we have it now.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.740]   So it's a side hustle for him, so he started doing it on the side, which is to say it's
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.560]   quite possible that no matter where he worked, he would have been working on information
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.320]   theory in the off hours.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.800]   The advantage of working at Balab's is, one, he's around communication networks all the
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   time.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.320]   Two, he's doing cryptography and cryptographic analysis, so he's thinking a lot about that.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.680]   And then three, he sort of is around smart and intelligent people, and maybe the fourth
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.000]   thing is he has the Bell Systems Technical Journal, where he can publish his findings
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.280]   originally, and they're a private sector organization that has a technical journal
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.640]   that gets distributed pretty widely throughout academia.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.160]   But I suspect that if he were working, I don't know, wherever, he would have actually been
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.960]   working on information theory on the side anyway, because this was stuff he was just
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.640]   interested in broadly.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.320]   That level of self ... So think about what that means.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.080]   He's a self-starter who's willing to do academic research just on the side and write papers
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.680]   about it just for kind of the sheer thrill of discovery.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.200]   The number of people that that's true of, I think, in society is very, very small, meaning
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.080]   he didn't think he was going to ... You can't IPO an academic paper, right?
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.360]   He's not going to get rich, right?
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.440]   He's kind of not seeking fame, because even when he becomes famous, he actually decides
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.720]   he's not going to go on the lecture circuit or go on late night TV or anything like that,
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   right?
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.320]   So the population of people who are like that is very, very small, right, for a variety
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   of reasons.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.840]   We don't have to get into it, but it's just sort of self-evident that the number of people
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.240]   who would want to do that is small.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.400]   PayPal's a different story.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.800]   Profit motive is a big part of what makes places like that successful.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.680]   The internet boom is going on.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.160]   There's an entire generation of people who have built web companies, right, starting
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.080]   with like Netscape, who are IPOing, and all of a sudden, they're on the covers of magazines,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.720]   and they have huge amounts of wealth.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.960]   So it would be dishonest to say that that's not part of the motivation there.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:24.360]   There's that combined with this pressure of PayPal closes a very big round of fundraising
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.880]   in March of 2000, just as the dot-com bubble starts to burst.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.120]   And so there's a kind of panic about surviving and about having to innovate your way to survival.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.580]   And so I think that, you know, I'm not saying that like there aren't other Claude Shannons
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.580]   out there.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.540]   I just think that they're smaller in number than maybe a constellation of people who are
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.200]   brought together by forces and are forced to survive and are forced to build a startup
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.160]   and then like can learn innovation that way.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.900]   And the other thing I would say is I think the innovations are very different, right?
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.900]   So PayPal's innovations are, I would argue, are a sequence of kind of micro developments
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.140]   and creations strung kind of end-to-end over the period of four years.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.200]   It helps to build the company and there's a lot of like, we can get into that obviously.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.920]   And Shannon is writing, you know, a technical paper in 1948 and it sets certain principles
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   and establishes the field of information theory.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.640]   So I'm not sure it's like an apples to apples comparison, but I do like the idea of like
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.680]   thinking characterologically and saying, okay, there are probably some Shannons in the world,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.020]   but they are probably far outnumbered by the number of people who would want to create
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.040]   a startup and have, by the way, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.780]   Like more self-interested reasons, right, as opposed to public spirited reasons or academic
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.780]   reasons.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.780]   Interesting.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.720]   So, you know, my interpretation of all your books is in all of them, you're really writing
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.420]   about, you know, seniors, just a group of people who can get together and boost each
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.420]   other's productivity.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.540]   Now, you know, that's obvious with Bell Labs, when Klaus Shannon, obvious with the founders
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.540]   and the PayPal Mafia.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.020]   And, you know, I think it's even true of, you know, your book on Cato, right?
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.760]   So it's like 2000 years later, can you imagine another era where we know all the prominent
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.120]   politicians are like household names, you know, Pompey, Crassus, Cato, Cicero, you know,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   Caesar.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.680]   So, you know, like this book is about political seniors, you know, just like, I can't imagine
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.200]   like 2000 years, we'll know who Nancy Pelosi or, you know, Mitch McConnell or Donald Trump
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.320]   were, or maybe we might know who Donald Trump is, 2000 years.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320]   But yeah.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.440]   Well, you know what, another era would be the late 1700s in the United States, right,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   Jefferson?
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.000]   I mean, they make their award winning musicals being made about people who wore powdered
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.960]   wigs and tricornered hats, right?
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:50.920]   And so if Lin-Manuel Miranda can make Hamilton a thing in 2022, and frankly, like that era
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.840]   is just one of the most studied and discussed, it does strike me that that's another senior.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.520]   There's a great book on that actually called Founding Brothers.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.560]   That was one of my like, kind of texts that made me think a lot about the founders.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.040]   Because it does describe like the relationships, like, for example, like the relationships
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.160]   between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams is super interesting, right?
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.080]   They're like competitive, and then they're friendly, and then they're not, and there's
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.720]   all kinds of drama there.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.120]   The relationships just across the founding generation, I would think is another senior.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.960]   But it's interesting, I never picked, I never, I didn't pick up on that common thread until
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.200]   you just pointed it out, which is like, always fun.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.720]   It's always, this is why I like doing these, because I'm always like learning new things.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.960]   I didn't, I realized, okay, there's a senior in all three of my books.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.560]   Cool, cool.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.360]   Now, you know, I'm curious how Peter Thiel's ideas about Girard were influenced by his
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   time at PayPal.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.080]   So, you know, there's the obvious, you know, mimetic competition between X.com and Confinity,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.480]   which was, you know, what PayPal was originally.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.120]   And then X.com was, you know, Musk's company before they merged.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.320]   So I mean, other than, like, what were the other Girardian elements to this story?
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.200]   Yeah, you know, it's a great question.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.120]   It's a part, it's sort of threaded throughout the book, like in subtle ways.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.840]   And what's really interesting is that in rereading it myself, or in like revising and editing
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.160]   it, there were a number of, like, Girardian moments that came up, right, or like little
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.040]   moments of mimesis and anti-mimesis.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:28.600]   I have had long conversations with a friend, Luke Burgess, who wrote a book called Wanting.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.860]   And we've sort of talked about this a lot, right, and like, where are these moments true
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.860]   and not true?
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.520]   And one of the things that I always tell Luke is I'm like, I think that the actual experience
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.780]   of doing PayPal was not an experience of someone like Peter, as well-versed as he is, stepping
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.400]   back and being able to, like, sort of ask, like, what would Girard do?
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   Like WWGD, right?
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.040]   Like, I don't think that it works that way.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.440]   And the reason is, I mean, A, he never told me that it worked that way, and I interviewed
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.820]   him at great length about the PayPal story.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.020]   But the other thing is, like, companies, particularly PayPal, when they're built in this crucible,
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.400]   it's really hard for theory to match up with reality, or like, or for your ideas about
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   principles to match up with, like, the exigencies of the moment, or like the thing you need
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.500]   to do.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.620]   And so here's one example I would offer as a case study in what I just said, but also
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.620]   in Girard.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.360]   Post 9/11, the company is in a really difficult position.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.160]   They had been preparing to go public and had kind of run into some hiccups with the bankers
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   that were going to help underwrite their public offering.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:42.440]   Then 9/11 happens, and the financial district, you know, is in ruins, and the economy's in
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.760]   shock, the stock market's shut down for, you know, however many days.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.280]   And the company leadership needs to think about, like, what do we do now?
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.600]   Like, how do you go public in a post 9/11 world?
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.520]   What does it even mean to file to go public?
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.560]   And Peter, there's a great line that he played back to me.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.920]   Again, this was 20 years of hindsight, he says, "Maybe because no one else is going
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.720]   public, paradoxically, that's actually exactly the time that you should go public, right?
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.040]   Because you're kind of, like, running against the herd, right?"
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.280]   So like, is there some faint echo, or even maybe not a faint echo of Girard in there?
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.660]   Absolutely, there it is, right?
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.360]   So one has to believe that at some point, part of his mind, one of the things about
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.160]   studying mimetic desire is the recognition that, like, mimetic desire, if you oppose
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.920]   it, can actually lead to very valuable decisions, right?
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.560]   Everyone zigs, you decide to zag, and like, wow, that's a really smart thing.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.840]   But here's what he added to his explanation of why they decided to go public after September
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.480]   11th, and what it meant.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.480]   Number two reason is going public is a long process.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.180]   You have to file so many different rounds of paperwork to the SEC, you have to get so
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.100]   much buttoned up, you have to do a roadshow, you have to make sure that all these things
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.800]   that in a startup, you can kind of, like, create a patchwork quilt of answers.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.280]   That's not allowed once you are, like, a regulated public company taking, like, public investor
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.540]   dollars, right?
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.340]   So he said that it takes, because it takes a long time.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.940]   One of my theses was like, if we apply, even if it's after September 11th, and even if
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.880]   we take some flack for doing that, it's going to be six months to a year before we actually
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880]   get to go public.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.500]   So given that it's a long road, we should prepare now.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.460]   So that's sort of reason two.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.540]   Reason three, and this is where it runs counter to the Girardian, you know, one of Girard's
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:31.340]   big thing is, is like, like, how emotion can kind of, and emotion can kind of screw up
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.340]   our decisions, right?
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.700]   Like, it sort of, like, obscures, like, clarity of thought.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.060]   And one of the things that he says is, he's like, you know, he had said to me, he's like,
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.460]   I'm being honest, like, another reason that I insisted that we try to go public after
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.500]   9/11, is I wanted to beat Wall Street, like, Wall Street had written off the company, it
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.140]   had been so dismissive of the company, and like, didn't understand the model, because
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.420]   FinTech wasn't an established space.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.980]   And so he said, he even said to me, he's like, if I'm being honest, the competitive thing
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.460]   was a part of it, right?
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.660]   But competition is sort of not in keeping with Girard, meaning he recognizes that it
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.660]   can happen.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.320]   But the whole point of studying this is to avoid it.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.860]   It's a welter of motives.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.660]   And I don't think that there's anyone that could look at the story and say, well, every
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.780]   decision was like, sort of perfectly conformed to Girardian expectation and insight.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.060]   But I think of that, I don't think of that as a deficit, by the way, I think of that
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.060]   as a good thing.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.940]   And the way that I fact checked each of those, those things, as well as I spoke to other
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.080]   people, particularly on the competition with the investment banks thing, like, the number
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.100]   of times I heard like a negative word about like, big banks, but it was, it was, you know,
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.900]   a dozen times if it was one.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.380]   And I had people say to me, you know, the biggest issue that we had there was, because
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.780]   FinTech was not an established, like, sector of the economy, we didn't have a way to get
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.540]   these banks to understand what we were, who we were, what the business would be, what
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.100]   its potential was, right?
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.180]   And so, like, language like network effects is kind of common for us, and in 2022, but
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.400]   it was not common back then for business models.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.920]   And so you just have this whole industry that needs to be educated, and PayPal ran into
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.400]   some real difficulty educating them, which is why they were competitive, like the way
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.440]   Peter described in the book, as he said, it's like a Silicon Valley versus Wall Street thing,
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.000]   the dynamic that was at play there.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.560]   That's a very long answer to your question.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.800]   I found moments of that Girardian intuition, and I'll, if you permit me, I can share the
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.840]   second big bucket where I found it.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.420]   9/11 is a discreet example, it's really specific.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.620]   The other big bucket, and again, I'm like way over simplifying Girard, right?
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.560]   Like, he's actually like a huge thinker, and I could've, I mean, Luke did write an entire
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.380]   book about him, right, and like his thought process.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.940]   But one of the things that it always leads me to think about is if the entire world says
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.220]   X and you can even think Y, right, like, or you can think about the opposite of X, right?
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.980]   What if the opposite is true?
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.820]   You can find real power in those moments, right, by being a contrarian, right?
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.800]   And that's, like, not a great word because it's so overused, but one of the things that
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.580]   I found most powerfully about Peter in the PayPal story is that he did that with people.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.680]   So the board would say, "Roll off, but that can't be your CFO."
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.480]   I mean, he's like 26 years old, he's like fresh out of business school, he's going to
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.360]   get eaten, and one person said, literally, the quote is, "He's going to get eaten alive
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360]   by Wall Street."
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.720]   Like, how could you do that?
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.600]   It's going to make us, he's not going to survive.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.260]   Peter listens to his board and says, "No," and says, "Roll off is brilliant.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.980]   He knows the business cold.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.220]   He's built the model that's determining a bunch of the actions that we're taking as
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.660]   a business, and I believe that he will make an exceptional CFO," and he is ultimately
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.660]   right.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:43.300]   Reid Hoffman, a friend of Peter's from their Stanford days, Peter says to the board, "I'm
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.260]   going to appoint him as COO in January of 2000, very early in the business's lifecycle."
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.480]   The board, the two board members are like, "Wait, your COO is supposed to be a taskmaster
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.260]   and really keep people on point, be really aggressive," and Reid's like, "Friendly,"
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.360]   and he's, as one board member, he's a friendly, he's a community guy, that kind of thing,
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.720]   and Peter says, "No, one of the things that we lack as a business right now is the ability
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.400]   to have somebody who's going to be a diplomat, but a flexible diplomat who can interface
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.960]   with all these external bodies," and he said, "We need that," and sort of like titles being
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.240]   what they are, like, "He's going to be the person for that job," and he's proven right.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.220]   But I heard from the employees who are in those situations about Peter's willingness
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:30.660]   to run into the teeth of what might be regarded as best hiring practices or standard opinions,
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.760]   and I do think that there is more than a faint echo of Gerard in some of those moments.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.800]   I also think it's hugely instructive.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.920]   It really does make you think about hiring and who we count in and who we count out.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.880]   I think he had an ability to see potential in people and put them into places where they
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.000]   otherwise, like other people, may have missed that.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.840]   That's so interesting because there's definitely, as you said, so many medical elements to the
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.360]   timing that Peter Thiel was able to execute, right?
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.880]   Like you talk about in the book how he saw the dot-com bust coming, and so he was able
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.600]   to use the inflated valuations to raise the CRC.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.760]   I think you said a week before the bust happened, they closed their CRC.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.900]   And then conversely, once the bust happened, they were able to hire all this great talent
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.600]   because people weren't hiring as much in Silicon Valley.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.400]   I think my favorite anecdote or one of my favorite anecdotes from the book is how Thiel,
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.480]   after they raised $100 million, he's like, "All right, guys, the market is going to bust.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.400]   So why don't we transfer this $100 million into my hedge fund, and I'll short the market?"
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.720]   And then the guy from Sequoia on the board is like, "What the fuck are you talking about?"
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.640]   It's a funny moment.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.120]   And I mean, you can't tell it without laughing.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.760]   And I sort of laugh even when I think about it.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.920]   When it was explained to me...
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.120]   So there's sort of like two renditions of that story, right?
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.600]   One rendition is like the sinister or like whatever.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.320]   No, it wasn't that.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:04.680]   It was an enthusiastic and farsighted board member who saw a market collapse coming and
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.120]   saw a financial opportunity.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.560]   And the financial opportunity is you take the funding we just raised, use it to short
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:17.040]   the market, and we'll all get filthy rich, and then it's a sure thing.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.760]   And understandably, the board pushes back and says, "Well, you can't.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.000]   You do that because the funding we raised has contracts and has amendments that say
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.040]   that it's for these specific purposes."
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.560]   So they pour cold water on the idea.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.800]   Now, the interesting thing is that the board members I spoke to about it, one had this
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   to say.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.280]   He said, "You know, it's actually like..."
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.680]   He's like, "I often tell this story because I want people to appreciate that part of doing
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.200]   a startup in the way that this team did is like being somewhat disconnected from reality.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.360]   You almost have to be disconnected from reality and offer ideas that are maybe a little outlandish
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.880]   in order to push the limit of what is possible, right?"
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880]   So that was like one.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.560]   And then the other recollection was from John Malloy, who was a board member, who said,
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.440]   "Like, Peter was right."
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.040]   Like, the actual logic may have been what it was.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.800]   The mechanics may have been what they were, but actually the NASDAQ lost like 78% of its
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.400]   value over the next, like, whatever, 12 months.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.240]   And we would have made a lot of money if we had done that, and it was actually correct.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.240]   And so there's this...
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.640]   Now, they tell it, obviously, like with the benefit of 20 years of hindsight, and they
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.440]   tell it in a humorous way.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.560]   I think other writers have done characterizations that are more sinister.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.240]   I didn't find that element in it.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.360]   And when I asked Peter about it, he basically, you know, it was like the last question in
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.500]   one of my interviews with him.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.160]   And I asked him, I said, "What did you think about this?"
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.840]   And he said, he's like, "Yeah, you suggest things when you're young."
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   Like, basically, it was sort of like, you suggest things, like, you know, it was like
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.200]   an idea and it didn't go anywhere and, you know, whatever.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.520]   I find it to be a really interesting moment.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.920]   And it's characteristic of that group of people in a particular way, which is like the willingness
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.680]   to engage with even the idea that you would take $100 million and short the market.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:07.000]   I mean, like, I think a certain tolerance for that is like required to do something
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   like PayPal.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.280]   If I was on the board, I'd be like, "No, no, the markets are efficient.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.280]   You totally can't do that."
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.640]   But yeah, he was, I think he said they would have made more money by shorting the market
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.600]   than they did from the EV acquisition, but yeah.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.420]   I think the math is imprecise.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.520]   I mean, I think the math is imprecise because that was a quote from John Malloy.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.480]   I don't think he was being, I think he was being kind of directionally accurate, but
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.920]   not hadn't like run an Excel spreadsheet on it or anything.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:43.440]   One suspects that, you know, given what PayPal's burn rate was from 1999 to 2002, if someone
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.680]   were to do the math, like that might be true because they spent, I mean, they spent I think
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.440]   in excess of $200 million in the first four years of the business, right, despite raising
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.560]   a lot of money.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.600]   So it could be true, but I didn't get into the level of the math.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:04.080]   For me, it was much more about this idea that as a board member, you know, who is very thoughtful,
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:10.360]   you would still bring to the table an idea that can seem crazy is actually like a hallmark
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:17.400]   of what kind of Silicon Valley and of this sort of startup environment.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.400]   It's encouraging.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.800]   I think it's encouraging to those of us who have those sorts of thoughts.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.560]   Okay, so I re-read my zero to one after reading your book.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:33.040]   And I think at least, you know, I could be being superficial about this, but I think
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.000]   it seems like there's at least three ways in which, you know, the lessons from zero
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.200]   to one contradict the history of PayPal, right?
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.680]   So first there's like, he's like, okay, don't compete, like, you know, just do something
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   totally original.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.440]   And it's like, well, you know, payments, e-payments, that's like you're competing against x.com,
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:54.720]   Bill Point, Visa, MasterCard, he says, oh yeah, one of the most important things he
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.880]   says in the book is that you should always have a plan, you should always have a vision.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.720]   This whole thing about startups iterating and, you know, slowly pivoting to find their
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.000]   niche, that's totally overrated.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.240]   It's like your original business idea of encrypting pilots didn't go anywhere.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.360]   Your original business model of making money off the float didn't go anywhere.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.160]   Like you were totally pivoting and to your credit, right?
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.880]   And then the third thing is, you know, he talks about how these startups are emphasizing
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.280]   growth statistics that they're basically getting by burning VC money over the durability of
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.280]   the company.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   So they'll, you know, they'll just like look at a number.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.160]   And it's like, well, didn't you guys have the world domination index that you were constantly
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   looking at?
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.920]   So I could be totally missing like the deeper layer in which these lessons actually did
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   apply to PayPal.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.960]   And you could also say that, well, actually, because he learned this from PayPal, he changed
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   his mind.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.040]   But what is your reaction to these?
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.880]   Yeah, it's interesting, you know, people have said that the books are pretty good companion
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.600]   books because a bunch of the stories for mine, obviously, like sort of illustrate some of
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.320]   the principles from zero to one, and I would push back on a couple of the observations.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.520]   So with the competition one in particular, so like, let's go in order.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.080]   The competition one in particular is important because I actually think of the competitive
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.680]   dynamic as an illustration of what Peter was saying, and as the kind of lesson that led
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   him to write that.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.760]   Now, there's a gap between the PayPal story and zero to one.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.080]   So zero to one isn't just based on PayPal, zero to one is based on his experience as
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.360]   an investor broadly defined and teaching courses about startups at Stanford.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.720]   So but let's take a step back on the competition one.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.680]   PayPal starts as the union of two companies, it's X.com, which is Elon Musk's company,
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.960]   and Confinity, which is Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, Luke Nosek, Upan, and Russ Simmons,
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.600]   their company.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   What's interesting is that the two companies find themselves in competition.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:45.040]   One of, and this is in late 1999, and early 2000, and they are burning through money using
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.600]   bonuses as a way of referring users to try to goose user growth, and they're in an arms
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.080]   race with each other to give away money.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.040]   There's like, there's a great line in the book, it's like, Elon basically says, "We're
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.600]   going mental trying to kill each other," right?
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.240]   And his other great line is like, "It was sort of a race to see who could run out of
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.880]   money the fastest," right?
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.560]   Here's the interesting thing, Peter is one of the loudest voices and earliest voices
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:15.120]   in identifying that that is a, that's a competition to the death.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.920]   And that actually, that's really bad.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.560]   Like, it's not good for us to be spending, trying to outspend each other into oblivion.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:26.400]   He encourages and indeed pushes his board member, John Malloy, to consider the possibility
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   of a merger.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:33.240]   John Malloy is actually not all that hot on the idea of a merger between X.com and Confinity.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.360]   But Peter says, "No, you don't, like, this competition is ruinous.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.120]   It's like terrible to be competing at this level.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.560]   We should try to merge."
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.320]   And Peter is one of the most vocal people against the competition between X.com and
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.320]   Confinity.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.240]   And so that's like one place where like, I actually think of, of the PayPal story as
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.000]   a very clear illustration of his view of competition.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.520]   Now, he's not the only one developing PayPal, right?
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.720]   There's a bunch of voices in the room, bunch of people who think they could win, maybe
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   we could win.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.680]   They have their reasons for being for or against the merger.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.040]   But on the competition piece, it's a, it's a clear kind of example of this.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.440]   Your, what, what was your second, your second little divergence?
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:18.200]   Um, let's see, uh, it, oh, it was, um, you know, iteration, like iteration versus having
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.840]   a strong initial vision.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:29.240]   So I, I would say that, um, on this one, once PayPal establishes itself as a payment system,
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:35.240]   as a master merchant between eBay buyers and eBay sellers, and meaning, right, and just
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.320]   people who want to transact where they're able to underwrite these small dollar transactions.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.320]   Once that fundamental business model is established, you know, it, it, Peter's actually pretty
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.040]   committed to that vision going forward.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   Right?
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.800]   So you sort of, you have, and I think it'd be fair to say you have a period where they
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.600]   are figuring themselves out, right?
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.640]   Like figuring out what they're going to be when they grow up.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:04.760]   That period of, of we'll call it like very late 1998 through to 1999, once that cement
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.000]   dries to some degree, and they're like, well, and particularly Confinity, particularly Confinity
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.800]   is like, we're going to be an email payment system that is a credit card, master merchant,
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.200]   and then use that and get them to get the economics of the business.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   Right.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.080]   Once that happens, like they actually have a pretty clear roadmap for how things are
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   going to go.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.840]   And the way I know that is that I was seeing decks, so it was really neat to go back and
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.560]   look at the pitch decks as they evolved.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   Right.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.800]   The pitch deck as of late 1999 and 2000 is, is pretty well like locked.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.400]   Like it's not like they're using a payment system to pivot to something else.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.240]   Like there's actually consistency for call it three quarters of the early years of the
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.240]   business.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.360]   And I, I mean like, look, I wish I could get, get things that right and be that prescient
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.800]   all the time.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   Right.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:54.880]   The last piece on, on burn rate and like startups using call it like exaggerated or inflated
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.040]   growth metrics to, to like kind of burn VC cash.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.880]   Um, there's a little bit of truth to that.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.920]   I think that like actually the criticism in zero to one runs counter to the PayPal experience
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:13.040]   because PayPal did have to burn through a lot of money that the, the difference in PayPal's
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   case.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:20.120]   And the reason I don't think it's inconsistent is there's burn rate that you could forecast
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.520]   based on bonus payments.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   Right.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.920]   Like you sign up for PayPal, you get 10 bucks.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.840]   Like I can reasonably guess like at growth rates, like in terms of what I'm going to
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:34.400]   spend on that, what PayPal didn't anticipate and couldn't have anticipated knowing is the
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.600]   degree to which fraud would be the biggest like cost center for them.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.600]   And so the, the reason I mentioned that is because had they known that, you know, and
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.480]   they, a, they probably wouldn't have gone into the business.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.760]   I had multiple people who are at the founding say like if we had known how bad fraud was,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.400]   it's quite possible we wouldn't have done this to begin with.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   And, and, but it makes me think that like, actually like the plan, the plan in some ways
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.640]   was never to just like get a bunch of easy money and light it on fire and then use those
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.640]   numbers to sell a bigger, a bigger vision.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:09.000]   Very quickly, like they encounter something that's lighting their funds on fire that they
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.520]   didn't anticipate and they have to solve that problem, which becomes one of the company's
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.960]   signature achievements.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.120]   So I'm not sure I would quite argue that it was just like, let's do the VC cash grab,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.720]   get it all on fire, and then go out and sell.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:29.320]   The other reason that it's not quite that way is because in 2000, in late 2000 and in
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:34.920]   2001, when the company institutes fees and builds a business around this viral product,
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.520]   they are actually very thoughtfully like kind of creating a real enterprise, meaning like
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.520]   originally the idea was like, we're going to make money on the float.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.600]   So we're just gonna have a bunch of money and we'll, we'll get a few basis points on
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.960]   that because of interest.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   Right.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.560]   So in the year 2000, they start to build a fee structure for their users in a very careful
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:58.840]   way that would run against the criticism of like, well, you're just like getting a bunch
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.920]   of user growth and then that's it.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.920]   Right.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.400]   No, the, the, the second half of that for PayPal was we're going to build a, an incremental
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:12.520]   plan to essentially take a free to build a freemium model for our users so that we can
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.520]   bring revenue in.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.360]   And then at some point when they had run these elaborate spreadsheets, there was a point
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.920]   at which they had profitability.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.160]   So it was not quite as helter skelter.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.640]   I had to describe the part of it that was, which was like 1999 where they're figuring
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.120]   all of this stuff out.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.640]   The fraud piece is so interesting.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:36.000]   I mean, there's my favorite anecdote from the book and this is like so good that I almost
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.400]   don't believe it or I mean, I do believe it, but it's like if I saw it in a TV show or
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.600]   that that was like about a startup, like it was in like a Silicon Valley, the TV show,
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   I would be like, Oh, come on.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   That's that's you're pushing it.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.740]   It was, um, the, the Russian hackers who were committing fraud against, uh, against PayPal.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.400]   One of them emails, uh, Max Lemchin, the CTO and this guy had like an email exchange and
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.840]   yeah, I can't do a Russian accent, but the guy is like, you know, I'm from, uh, I'm from
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.640]   a poor Russian family, but we can't feed my family and you know, I need to do this in
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   order to feed my family.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.200]   You got to affect America and who doesn't understand.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.680]   And so he, and, and then, you know, they, uh, they implement CAPTCHA and the guy like
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.960]   in response, fuck you, like it was an epic cat and mouse game.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.080]   And it was one of the things that I found most like interesting about it is you never
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.880]   picture a CTO of a company communicating with the people who are trying to defraud his company,
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   right?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.800]   It's, it's almost, it's almost, it's not, it's a stretch, but not much of one to be
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.960]   like your fraudsters are like sort of a part of your product team, like weirdly like unpaid
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   members of your product team.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   Um, okay.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.280]   So why was Peter Thiel so good at spotting talent and how he has consistently been that
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.960]   way with, uh, with his VC, uh, VC investments?
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.320]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:57.060]   And if, if there's one thing I, it's in the book that emerges, but I don't have like a
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:02.560]   general theory of, right, like a grand unifying theory of it's this talent spotting.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:08.280]   Um, I think it's, if I had to, if, uh, let me, let me take a step back and sort of like
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.240]   talk through some of the stories from the book.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:20.960]   Um, what one thing that I think he's very good at is not holding like kinda a lack of
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.280]   social graces against people.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.480]   Uh, so I will, I'll sort of share a story, right?
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.800]   I, there's this moment that I interviewed Reid Hoffman about.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.560]   Reid is on, uh, Reid is, is considering joining the board of Confinity, the company co-founded
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.720]   by Peter and Max.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.680]   And Peter says, you know, my co-founder is Max, but you've never met him.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.280]   You guys should probably go have breakfast.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.360]   You can't join the board without Max agreeing to it.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.080]   And they meet at Hobie's and Reid and Max are sitting down.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   And the way that Reid Hoffman described this to me, endearingly, cause he likes Max a lot.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.880]   He said for 45 minutes, all I could think was like, look the fuck up because he was
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:04.520]   looking down at the ground while explaining what Confinity's products were and what the
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.360]   company was going to be.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.920]   There was a time he, today, Max Levchin is as comfortable on a tech crunch stage as he
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.080]   is like, you know, with his, with Everett, with his companies.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   Um, but there was a time when that wasn't true.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.900]   And when the best thing that he wanted, the thing he wanted most to do in the world was
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.320]   to write code and to build engineering products and to build, sorry, to build technological
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.680]   products and to be an engineer.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:33.400]   It takes a certain level of the ability to kind of sort of, let's say suspend disbelief
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   about somebody or to like, like take a chance on somebody to say, you know, like this CTO
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.560]   may not be able to look me in the eye when he talks to me, but he's brilliant and I want
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.040]   to support him with my money and then become CEO of his company.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:51.360]   And so that willingness to like, look the other way on certain social graces is actually
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.720]   like a skill, right?
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.760]   So think about how many, like how many McKinsey interview, how many McKinsey interviewees
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.420]   would be turned down if they weren't able to look their interviewers in the eye.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.400]   But they might actually be the smartest people who are interviewing right now.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.200]   They might not be the best person for that particular job, but how many times do we write
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.600]   people off because of the way they look, the way they talk, the way they sound, the color
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.800]   of their hair, the color of their clothes, some random quirk of personality or, or something
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.880]   in their brain, like we write people off.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:25.520]   He, more than anyone in the story, I think was, was actually like, like sort of was drawn
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.960]   to that, right?
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.800]   Was drawn to this kind of person that might be a misfit or at the margins and was like,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   now you have real talent.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.200]   You're going to be brought into this, into this fold.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.520]   There were a great example of this.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.720]   There are high school dropouts on the roster at Confinity and this is before dropping out
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.720]   became cool, right?
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.040]   Like, let's, let's also establish like this is before the Thiel Fellowship.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.960]   It is before Mark Zuckerberg, the legend, all that stuff.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.800]   Like it's before all of these cultural cues that like high school and college may not
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   be the best fit for everyone.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.560]   There were two people I interviewed who are high school dropouts and one of them is literally
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.880]   is, is literal reason was like, I just thought high school was stupid and I was going to
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   like make more money writing code and doing computer stuff and he leaves and he goes and
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.960]   does his thing.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.340]   So I think there's a roster of people like that that might not find effectiveness in
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.600]   other parts of American life or American economic life, but where he sees real potential.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.000]   That's one thing.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.400]   The second thing is, you know, he is ridiculously smart himself.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.280]   Like he is a kind of grandmaster chess player, very widely read, like very well educated.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.760]   He has a high bar for people who he wants to hang out with.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   Right.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.240]   So if you sort of like are going to even be in the group that's around him, you have to
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.720]   have a certain level of intelligence.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.560]   Like it's just sort of, that's like table stakes.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.260]   It's sort of obvious to say it, but it's actually really important.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.640]   But talent and intelligence, there's like, there's a degree of overlap there, right?
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.840]   Like there's that spot on the Venn diagram, there's certainly some overlap.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:55.000]   The last thing I would say is, you know, he, he had this ability that was played back to
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.240]   me by other people to forecast what someone could be.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.240]   Right.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.120]   So to sort of like, like to actually like, kind of like what you might call a crystal
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   ball, their lives.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   Right.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.120]   Sort of like looking into a crystal ball and seeing what they could be.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.220]   And the kind of like outlining that for someone.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.780]   There's a really good podcast that Max Levchin does where he describes this, this, it came
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.780]   way after PayPal.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.220]   And he said that one of Peter's talents is this ability to like, see what your future
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.740]   could be and then play it back to you and then help you get there.
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.740]   Right.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.300]   And he said, he's done this over and back says he's done this over and over and over
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.300]   again.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.820]   I saw that play out very powerfully because I would interview with people who felt like
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.500]   they weren't good enough to be at PayPal, or maybe they weren't, didn't have the chops
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.820]   or whatever.
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.420]   And they would say, you know, Peter would sort of like outline the vision of what I
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.420]   could do.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.420]   And I totally bought it.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.260]   I was like, I'm in, I can do that.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.260]   Right.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.020]   And he gave people a lot of rope.
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.200]   All of that, I think is like, I think you're going to have a hard time.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.420]   And maybe Tyler Cowen's book on talent does this, because there's a whole section in there
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.740]   about Peter.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.380]   But I think of those features that I just described, like as actually very powerful
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.660]   things that are not specific to Peter Thiel, like all of us could do more of that.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.660]   Right.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.660]   We could become more intelligent.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.780]   We could embrace misfits more.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:12.260]   And we could help the people who are around us, like outline the biggest and best versions
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.260]   of their lives.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.260]   Right.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.980]   So I don't think it's just like this specific Peter Thiel thing.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.420]   I think these are actually things that like all of us could probably do more of.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.580]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:28.580]   And speaking of talent, did PayPal discover talent or did it make it?
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:36.300]   So I mean, obviously the PayPal mafia, they found LinkedIn, YouTube, Yelp, Tesla, SpaceX,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.220]   maybe now Twitter.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:48.260]   And so is it just that Max and Peter were able to identify these people who are going
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.780]   to end up doing great things?
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:55.500]   Or did the experience at PayPal make these the kind of people who could actually basically
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.980]   form half of Silicon Valley?
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.820]   It's the great sort of nature nurture question, right?
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:09.340]   Like was it, were they going to be the dream team or did they become the dream team, right?
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.980]   Like was it Michael Jordan or Phil Jackson, right?
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.460]   Like was it the triangle offense or not?
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.540]   And I think the only honest answer is both.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:25.260]   It is the case that the talent that was drawn to work at PayPal.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.340]   Many of them were cut above in whatever thing they were cut above at, right?
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:34.260]   Whether it was the ability to see the product vision in the way that David Sachs could,
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:38.060]   or the ability to fight fraud, right, or the ability to like just write really great code
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.660]   and release products quickly.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.380]   There's a certain kind of person that got through the door, right?
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:51.140]   That said, the experience of building a startup under duress and in the middle of a dot-com
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:57.900]   bust and kind of facing like these kind of clash of the titans at the executive level
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:04.700]   and merging two companies and having to deal with broad and all the rest, it was like 25
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.180]   years of experience compressed into four years.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:14.700]   And it was like a graduate education times three for some of these people that you could
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.940]   not separate from the things they have done later.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:23.740]   Sometimes that's in very direct ways, meaning, here's an example, YouTube's strategy of making
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:30.580]   itself ridiculously good at being embeddable in various sites has a direct tie to PayPal's
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:35.100]   strategy of making itself ridiculously good at being embeddable on various sites.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:42.300]   Full stop, I heard story after story about how like YouTube as an early company would
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:47.380]   get users who were being frustrated by other platforms to complain if a YouTube player
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.740]   was shut down.
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.180]   PayPal did exactly the same thing, right?
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:56.660]   So there's no way to divorce the later successes from PayPal.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:03.100]   There's another really obvious reason, which is they had a financial exit at the end.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:10.040]   In early and late 2002, you have a group of people who don't have world historic sums
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:15.860]   of money, but they have enough money to provide seed capital to other startups, including
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.820]   Yelp and YouTube and Facebook and all the rest, on down the line, right?
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.420]   They have the ability to write a check without the discomfort that might come from if they'd
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.860]   written that check in 1998, right?
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.660]   So that's kind of reason two.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:35.060]   Reason three is that they had seen what somebody played this back on a podcast I was on, I
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.060]   think it was Max Levchin.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.580]   Like they had actually like delivered returns for investors, right?
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:44.460]   So it wasn't just the PayPal kind of group of people, but that actually that Sequoia
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:50.700]   and Blue Run are what was known as Nokia Ventures and John Malloy and all these other groups
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.020]   that invested in them had actually gotten a healthy return and that built a track record
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.580]   and a credibility so that they could go out and get venture backing, not just backing
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:04.600]   from Peter Thiel or backing from Max Levchin, but backing from big venture capital firms
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.380]   that were going to look at these people and say, "You've been down this road before.
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.660]   You sort of have a template," right?
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.480]   And then the last thing I would say, and this is crucially, crucially important, but it's
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.980]   often missed in the retelling of this story because here's what people, here's how people
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.980]   think the narrative goes.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.660]   They're like the PayPal people made some money, then they went off and took that money and
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.340]   turned it into more money and then turned more money into even more money, right?
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.420]   And it is not that tidy, number one, because you're talking about several hundred people
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.400]   and not everybody had that experience.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:38.020]   But number two, part of what happened is that you have a focus on product distribution at
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.760]   PayPal that is very serious and very rigorous.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:46.560]   So one of the big lessons learned is it's not good enough to just make something.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.640]   You have to actually figure out how people are going to find it, use it, and then part
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.260]   ways with their money to pay you for it, right?
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.680]   Which is a very different challenge.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.720]   And there's a team member, David Sacks, who this is the lesson that his kind of team takes
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   away.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.920]   And these people have gone on to very senior product roles in other companies, but it take
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.800]   that experience away and what are you left with, right?
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.840]   Meaning how would someone understand that in a fine grain way in any other context?
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.000]   You can't read about it in a book necessarily, I mean you could, but it's harder, right?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.600]   Thinking rigorously about product distribution becomes a very big part and parcel, particularly
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.360]   of the people on the product team.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.120]   So I think the answer has to be both as unsatisfying as it is.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.800]   It's not just that you can go out, pluck talent, bring them into your company, and later you
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:39.020]   will all go on to host Saturday Night Live and potentially own whatever, all of Twitter.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:44.440]   It's actually, you have this group of talented people and they go through a shared experience
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.440]   together that's really intense.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.080]   And just also, cards on the table, it's the reason I wrote the book.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:54.480]   The book would actually be uninteresting if it were just a random group of people who
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.280]   went through this experience and it would be uninteresting if it was just like, "Oh,
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.840]   we just hired a team of five Michael Jordans and won 20 NBA championships in a row."
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.720]   Of course you did.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.400]   Of course that happened, right?
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.760]   It would be uninteresting if it were either or.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.560]   Yeah, yeah, that's so true.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.660]   There's a really great talk that Max Lufshin gave at a startup school, I think a few years
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.920]   after PayPal.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:24.020]   And one of the things he mentions is that they apparently got a multimillion dollar
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.880]   check from the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.640]   And I don't think that was in the book, but what was that about?
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.640]   What happened there?
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:41.040]   Yeah, it was, there was an entity that was attached to the Japanese mafia, the Yakuza.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.240]   And there was, these stories have become conflated in the retelling.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:52.880]   And there's a little nod to it in the book, but basically what happens is there's a private
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.660]   company that's attached to the Japanese mafia.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.600]   And the reason that Max and Peter have both told this story over and over again, it's
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.160]   not actually to illustrate their connections to the mob because they don't have them.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:11.760]   The reason is because the money was, this is sort of funny, there was so much hype about
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:19.920]   Silicon Valley and so much interest in investing in late 1999 and early 2000 that one of the
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.920]   companies, and it might've been that one, basically wanted to send them the money without
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.880]   any kind of like contracts or anything, just ask for the wire instructions and we're like,
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.280]   we just want to give you the cash.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:36.280]   And it struck them and it struck Peter in particular as like basically an example of
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.600]   like the worst kind of memetic problem, right?
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.120]   Which is like, if everyone thinks every company in Silicon Valley is going to be successful,
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.120]   there is something wrong.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.080]   Like something's gone cuckoo if someone's saying to you, let me just, just give me the,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.760]   give me your bank account number and your routing number, I just gotta wire the money
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.560]   right now, we'll work the paperwork out later, right?
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.760]   Which is what was happening and that money ended up being a little bit more ethically
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.720]   complicated because of its connections.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.040]   But that, they use the story, if I recall it correctly, as an illustration of that.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:10.040]   Just how aggressive the environment was to get money to an American company that basically
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.720]   its principal accomplishment at the time was like building an email payments infrastructure
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.280]   and giving away bonus funding, right?
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.960]   Where it's like burn rate was ridiculous, but you have this company halfway across the
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.960]   world that's so excited that it's just going to, and then they find out later, like it's
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.560]   got these unsavory ties.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.640]   You know, there were story after story like that.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.440]   And it's actually a big part of Elon's experience as well.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.760]   Like he, I described him, I said, how difficult was it to fundraise in early 2000?
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:38.260]   He goes, it's really not that difficult when, his line about it is like, when everyone's
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.240]   pounding on your door and trying to fire, fire hose you with cash, right?
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.240]   It's not exactly what I would call it.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.920]   He's like, it's not exactly what I would call like fundraising, right?
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.160]   If everyone's like basically trying to give you cash, which was their experience in spite
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.160]   of that.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.680]   And this is interesting, gets back to the first question you asked.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.000]   In spite of that, Peter is pretty insistent during March of 2000 that they close their
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   fundraising quickly.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.320]   Because his view is like, this might be true now.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.440]   Like some random company might be trying to basically wire transfer us money without any
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.200]   strings attached and no contracts.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.280]   But that will change as soon as the market starts to slide.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.200]   And so it is actually like one of the things where people want to talk about the genius
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.260]   of this group.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.040]   And I think there is some truth to that.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.520]   There's also, you have to recognize that like the closing of the fundraising in March of
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.240]   2000 is a fortuitous event.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.160]   It's a timing event, right?
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.400]   And even when I interviewed, particularly I would say like mid and junior level employees,
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.660]   they would talk about it as like a quasi religious, like almost like a watershed, right?
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.980]   That they're like, okay, we managed to secure this round.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.620]   And then just a little bit after, like things completely take a dive.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:49.700]   I, again, I tried to, I went for substance over like exploring Yakuza connections.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:53.300]   I also like did not want to like be calling up random phone numbers to ask who's affiliated
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.300]   with the Japanese mafia.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.740]   Like, you know, I don't think that's a good look for somebody like me.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:03.380]   **Matt Stauffer:** Yeah, it's, I hear that apparently there
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:08.140]   will be a TV show made of this book and this would be a great, I don't know, a great, like
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.460]   at least like five minute, five minute edition.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.460]   **Justin Jackson:** I think so.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.460]   I think it'd be fun.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.460]   **Matt Stauffer:** Yeah.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.500]   By the way, is that happening, the TV show or?
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.500]   **Justin Jackson:** Yeah.
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.500]   It's in the works.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.620]   There's a producer named Mark Goffman who got his start on one of my favorite shows,
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.980]   which is West Wing and recently did Umbrella Academy.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.420]   And he was on, I think it's called Limitless.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.260]   It was on CBS.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.260]   And Mark is really great.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.700]   And he and I have been in touch for actually a long while about the project.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:39.100]   I think what he recognizes in it is what I saw, which is if you have a room of very,
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:44.340]   very smart people and they face some very, very big challenges and they don't entirely
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.940]   agree on how they're going to fix everything, that makes for a really interesting narrative.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:54.500]   It makes for really interesting and thought provoking back and forth and like contests
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:00.820]   of ideas and contests of ambition and ego and just what comes out of that is very energetic.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.180]   He sensed that energy a few years back and had reached out to me.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:09.980]   And he, along with a few others, have been championing this project.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:10.980]   So I hope it goes somewhere.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.980]   But you never know.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.340]   Hollywood's always a little unpredictable in that way.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.100]   **Matt Stauffer:** I really hope so because one of the things
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:20.820]   that makes this story so incredible is it's kind of like watching an Avengers movie or
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.380]   a superhero movie where you know that Spider-Man's going to win, right?
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.380]   They're not going to kill off Spider-Man.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.380]   It's like Elon Musk is...
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.380]   Come on, it's Elon Musk.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.820]   They're not going to go bust.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.960]   But then you're like, "Oh, you're supposed to believe that this first fight where Spider-Man
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.260]   almost dies, that's the end.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.940]   The second fight where Spider-Man almost dies, that's the end."
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.180]   You read this book and it's like, "Oh, people almost went bust here.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.660]   They lost their backups here and they almost went bust.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.280]   They were at the edge of their funding here."
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.940]   But it's like, "Oh, come on.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:46.940]   It's Peter Thiel.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.940]   It's Elon Musk.
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   How could that happen?"
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:49.940]   **Justin Jackson:** How could that happen?
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.460]   And it's actually a really important point and no one has really brought that up.
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:47:02.900]   And I'm glad you did because it strikes me that the problem with seeing them as invincible
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:07.500]   is that it actually makes other people think that they can't do these things even when
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.820]   they fail.
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:14.420]   And the reason that the PayPal story, at least my version of it, has so much failure in it
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:19.400]   is because if we pretend that they're not superheroes for a minute, if we bring them
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:25.840]   back down to earth, if we tell the stories of accidentally hot swapping hard drives and
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:34.760]   almost losing the company's entire source code, it makes it okay for many other people
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:39.920]   to do the kinds of work that they do and be okay with a little bit of some odds and ends
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.420]   and some wrong terms here and there.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:47.760]   I had a friend who was a startup founder who basically said a version of, "It's really
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:53.800]   comforting to know that Elon and Peter and David experienced anxiety."
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   To know that they were nervous actually makes me feel good.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:04.280]   And he told me, "Your book is like therapy because if they lived through this and lived
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.200]   to tell about it and were successful, maybe there's hope for me."
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.080]   And I didn't intend to do that, the purpose of my book was just to tell the story, but
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.600]   I do think of it as actually really, really important.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.080]   **Matt Stauffer:** Yeah.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.280]   And there's a strong memetic element to the fact that you publish the book in a very positive
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   way.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.280]   You have this really moving epilogue.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:31.560]   I won't spoil it for the people who might want to read the book, but I'm 21 and I'm
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:36.640]   a programmer and I'm reading this book like, "Fuck yeah, I want to do this shit," which
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.480]   is a totally memetic desire, right?
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.520]   But yeah, that's definitely one you want to spread.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   **Ezra Klein:** Right.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   **Matt Stauffer:** Yeah.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   Okay.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.160]   So one question I've always had when I'm reading this kind of stuff is, what does somebody
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:53.960]   like Elon Musk or Peter Thiel, what do they do in a pre-capitalist society?
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.920]   Imagine the era of Cato, are they going to conquer Gaul like Caesar?
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:04.160]   What if somebody is super competent and ambitious, but also really clever and intelligent and
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.160]   doing those eras?
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.260]   And conversely, you can ask the question, what does somebody like Napoleon and Churchill
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.040]   do when there's not a war, there's not a total war going on?
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.120]   Or are they starter founders?
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.000]   Or do they just open up a restaurant or something?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.800]   **Ezra Klein:** Well, here, let's go back to what we were
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:25.000]   talking about at the beginning, where if you were to look at the late 1700s era generation
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.480]   in the United States with the American Revolution, right?
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.520]   So you have Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, and those I think are two really interesting
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.480]   figures to have in this context.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:42.560]   I have a sneaking suspicion that, no, you know, Ben Franklin was an entrepreneur, right?
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.840]   So his start was in printing, and he was a printer and did printing presses and made
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:53.560]   books and things, but was an entrepreneur and a kind of broadly scientifically interested.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:58.000]   Jefferson too had all these random interests and random writings.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:06.440]   He built and designed Monticello, the layout for the University of Virginia bears his signature,
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.880]   in addition to writing the Declaration of Independence and all these other things.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.280]   So you have people who are polymaths, right?
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.520]   And I suspect that if they were alive today, do I think they would be involved in business
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.480]   and in government?
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   Probably in some capacity.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.520]   Do I think they would be entrepreneurs?
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.560]   Almost certainly, right?
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:29.080]   And I think that some of the hallmarks of their ability to read widely, the ability
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:36.440]   to just actually commit themselves to self-education, meaning like, "I wonder what Ben Franklin
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.600]   would have been like if he had YouTube."
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.480]   You got to believe that like the guy would have just wanted to learn everything because
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:47.680]   he displays that quality in his books and in other writings and things he did and just
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.760]   in the way he lived his life.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   You know, I don't want to get too pathetic.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.600]   He might spend some time on other video streaming, he might spend some time on other video streaming
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   websites.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   That's right.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.600]   Like you'd watch Ben Franklin's, right?
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   And Vimeo.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   He'd be a Vimeo guy, not a YouTube guy.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.320]   I don't know.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:08.840]   But it seems to me that there are certain hallmarks of places that are very potent in
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:13.220]   society where there's a lot of change happening or a lot of possibility of affecting big numbers
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.680]   of people attract smart and ambitious and energetic people.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.880]   I think in the late 1700s, if you were smart and energetic and ambitious, you had some
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   options available.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.480]   But probably if you're in the United States in like the colonial era, the hottest party
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.120]   in town is the American Revolution, right?
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.880]   And so you're going to find your way to that.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:38.540]   I think it's why the group that helped to create and build and nurture PayPal has gone
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:42.500]   on not just to accomplishments in business, but they've done things in politics and in
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.080]   art.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.080]   They've done things in film.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.040]   They've done things in books and literature.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.680]   They've done things in nonprofits, right?
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:57.960]   Even today, one of the companies that has a bunch of PayPal alumni associated with it
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:02.320]   is trying to reforest three billion acres of forest ecosystems.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.000]   And so I think that some of these characteristics, it's the reason that there's real power
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.720]   in reading about history, right?
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.040]   Because it actually makes you realize some of these things are outright at the level
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.680]   of character and that's malleable.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   We can improve.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.120]   We can get better.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:23.280]   And so then what's cool is you can play the game of like, "I wonder what so-and-so would
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.680]   be doing."
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:33.120]   I suspect that Ben Franklin today would probably make his way to Austin, Texas or Miami, right?
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.520]   I bet he'd be all in crypto.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.920]   This is a person who thought about everything from firefighting to daylight savings time.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:42.040]   You don't think he'd be totally down to have a long discussion about cryptocurrency?
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.720]   Of course he would.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.720]   Okay.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:52.360]   So one question I had is, once he got kicked out of PayPal, because he had this super ambitious
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:56.960]   vision of redoing the banking industry and the brokerage services industry and then making
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.720]   them cheaper and faster.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.120]   Why didn't he just be like, "All right, if PayPal doesn't want to do it, I guess I'll
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   just make a new company to do it."
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:08.200]   Why did he decide, "Finance is over, I'm going to make a pivot to Mars and electric vehicles."
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.320]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:16.840]   And I think there's a part of him that, in my discussions with him, he speaks openly
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.880]   about feeling like PayPal was a vision unfulfilled and that this is the sort of thing he would
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.400]   want to do at some point.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.920]   I think the honest answer is that he became oversubscribed, right?
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:33.280]   Not oversubscribed, but he became, call it, the passions that he had in college around
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:40.000]   electrical energy, sustainable energy, and around space travel re-engaged him post-PayPal.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.080]   And he went on to found SpaceX very quickly after his ousting at PayPal.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:52.000]   And those are the businesses that obviously occupy his time today, among others.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.200]   And so I think of it as a factor of...
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:00.360]   I don't think that the passion has ever left, meaning in my discussions with him, he could
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:04.920]   still become very impassioned about the necessary improvements to financial services that he
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.760]   believes are overdue.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:12.400]   But I think he has understandably made advancements in other fields.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.040]   And I feel like that's like...
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:23.160]   I think he still thinks finance is stuck in the 1980s and the 1990s, in terms of its infrastructures
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.600]   and its ecosystems.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.160]   But I think the other things he's doing are places where he could uniquely make a mark.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.840]   I'm not saying that he can't and the others, and maybe he can.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:37.240]   But I think that it was a matter of timing and circumstance, meaning leaving what he
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:45.160]   called X.com became PayPal, leaving X.com, he was able to shift into his Tesla and SpaceX
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.160]   years.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.880]   And so there was just a timing element there.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:54.180]   And I did have a couple lines in there from other people, Reid Hoffman, who mentioned
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.760]   that at one point, Elon was like, "We should get the band back together and there's still
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:01.320]   so much to do in financial services, and there's so much needs upgrading, and all these fees
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.320]   are so stupid."
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:08.560]   And Reid Hoffman sort of gently says, "Oh, man, just let it go.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:16.160]   You have so much other stuff going on."
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:22.840]   The more interesting thing to emphasize is in each case, what he is doing is what is
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.280]   kind of commonly known as first principles thinking.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:31.600]   And so the idea of like, if you were to go back to a first principles approach on finance,
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.960]   and you have to pay a wire transfer fee to me, if we're just passing ones and zeros through
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:41.040]   a database, if all we're doing is taking sort of one line on a spreadsheet and moving it
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.000]   to another line on a spreadsheet, and we can do that digitally now at almost no cost, why
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.900]   am I paying $25 for an inbound wire?
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:54.480]   Those sorts of questions animate SpaceX just as well as they animated PayPal and X.com,
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:59.560]   meaning let's break things down to what does it actually cost to launch a rocket into space?
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.840]   Now I think thinking about those questions is easier than doing something about them.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:09.680]   And so in the original conception of X.com, the idea was to unite financial services.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.340]   And the reason you want to unite financial services is it's better for consumers.
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.600]   It makes things faster, and it makes things cheaper.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.360]   If my mortgage and my savings account and my brokerage account are all managed by the
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.400]   same place, I won't be paying hefty fees when I need to move money around, and there won't
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.960]   be a three-day delay before a deposit comes in.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.200]   That's as true today as it ever was.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.420]   And so I think in each case, what he is really thinking about is let's begin from a place
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.360]   of first principles and work backwards to what the best solution is for customers.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.080]   It doesn't always work out perfectly, but I would argue that some of his criticisms
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   are still true.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:48.960]   I mean, I've paid a fee in my life that I would want back from my bank, and damn it,
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.080]   someone should fix that.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.400]   And so I think that's the reason.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:59.680]   The short answer to your question is time and his attention shifted to other things.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.840]   But then I think the longer answer is those problems still exist.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:09.160]   I'm glad you brought up the thing about the bank getting back together because that is
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.120]   actually one question I had, which was there's such an effective team.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:17.200]   And as far as I can tell, the only people who actually teamed up, not as just investor
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.400]   and founder, but as founder and founder, the only people who teamed up were the YouTube
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.400]   founders.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:25.600]   And so I'm curious, why didn't these people say, "Oh my gosh, PayPal, look at that huge
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   success.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.440]   Why don't we put this entire team together and do one thing together?"
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.460]   Why didn't they go up and do their different things?
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:36.160]   Was it just that these people all needed to be the big guy, given how talented they were?
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:41.400]   No, I don't think it's that.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.720]   Remember also, we're talking about a whole bunch of people, right?
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:52.440]   So PayPal pre-IPO in Palo Alto is around 200 people, give or take, and Omaha is several
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.440]   hundred people.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.800]   So it's not like a dozen people, right?
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.320]   Meaning there's actually a whole range of folks, and many of them have worked together
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.920]   on other things.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:07.400]   So Jeremy Stoppman and Russ Simmons, early PayPal, co-founded Yelp, right?
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:12.960]   Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, there's YouTube, there's all of these other entities.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.520]   There are employees that are early at PayPal that go on to work at LinkedIn, there are
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:21.120]   PayPal employees that go on to work at SpaceX, Tesla, so they do end up working together.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:27.920]   Meaning that the band isn't like a five, it's not the Beatles, it's like a hundred Beatles,
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   you know?
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.560]   It's like 500 people, right, or whatever.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:37.520]   And so it's hard to argue that they could bring it back together for one reason.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:44.240]   It's also the case that there were people there who went on to build things that maybe
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.600]   other people wouldn't want to participate in, right?
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:52.320]   So a good example is, or build things that couldn't scale.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.200]   My favorite example is the person who left PayPal after a very short tenure and became
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.880]   a very prominent professional magician.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:04.320]   And Daniel Chan was one of my favorite interviews because he did magic on Zoom while I was interviewing
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.940]   him, right, and did tricks with me.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:12.040]   But he's not building a venture-backed business to go make magic sound like a big thing, right?
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:17.000]   His business is fundamentally about perfecting his craft and doing it very, very well.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:23.080]   It was just ways in which like, would that blend with some of the things that Peter Kiel
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   is doing?
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.360]   Maybe, but I doubt it.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.880]   And so I don't think of it, by the way, as like a bad thing that the team went off into
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.120]   all these other directions because they're going off into all these other directions
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.920]   is the reason that we have YouTube and Yelp and LinkedIn and SpaceX and all of the rest.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.880]   And so I'm kind of, in some ways, I'm like comforted that they didn't all like stay together
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.080]   and do the next venture and do the next venture.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:51.120]   The other thing is the venture they did together, financial services, is very specific and it's
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.280]   very difficult.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.920]   And while some of them have done that again in the future, it's not the field that everybody
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.200]   wanted to participate in, right?
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.880]   So that's also really important is like intellectually, we have to remember that a lot of what you're
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.120]   doing if you're building financial services, like you're interacting with regulatory bodies
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.800]   all the time, you're interacting with and battling big banks and Visa and MasterCard.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.640]   And like, there's just a lot of people who, that was just, that's a lot of noise.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.920]   Like that's a lot of drama, it's a lot of diplomacy, it's a lot of very sensitive interactions
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.360]   about people's money.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.520]   And I think there was a bit of just burnout, right?
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.120]   Somebody could be called a PayPal PTSD.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.120]   You know what?
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.120]   People live their lives.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:32.240]   So I think it would be hard for some of these people who have been CEOs to be subordinate
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.240]   to others.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.440]   But I don't think that's the primary reason.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.680]   I think it's just they went off and pursued their own kind of interests and passions.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.680]   Okay.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.760]   I want to be respectful of your time.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.920]   So I'll ask you, I have one last question for you, which is, you know, you were the
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.880]   managing director at Huffington Post.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:56.720]   And I'm sure that involved being up to date, minute to minute on getting the featured articles
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.760]   out and managing social media.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760]   It is a very...
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.440]   Things are happening constantly.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:11.320]   And then now you're writing these books that take five years to compose and publish.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:17.200]   And you have this Robert Caro-like research and writing process where you're reading everything
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.040]   and you're watching all the interviews.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.640]   What was that transition like for you?
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.560]   And can you talk a little bit more about your writing process?
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.200]   It's like calling my process Robert Caro-like is like the nicest thing anybody's ever said
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200]   to me.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.680]   Because he's a beast and he's like the OG of my field, you know, and like is the best
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:40.320]   and everybody's kind of in his shadow because of the level of diligence that he brings.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:48.120]   You know, I like books because books take a long time.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.440]   They allow you to...
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.880]   I spent five and a half, six years on this PayPal project.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.120]   That's a long time to devote to one project.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.840]   I didn't do it full time, but it's still a long time to devote to a project.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.840]   And I like that.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:10.120]   And the reason I like it is because every new discovery yielded some other discovery.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.480]   And every new interview prompted some new insight.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.960]   And I found details that were left kind of underexplored or unexplored for so long.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:26.560]   And I got a lot of like joy out of the endurance of it, out of the like, let's like slog through
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.840]   this and really go for broke and really try to interview as many people as I could.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.040]   I admit like, I think, you know, I left digital media a long, long, long time ago and I'm
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.240]   sort of glad I did in a variety of reasons.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.440]   But the foremost of which is with books, you have the ability to patiently work your way
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.160]   through a topic for a very, very, very long time.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.680]   And like in my dream, like I get to do what Robert Caro does, right?
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.000]   My dream is 10 years on a book, right?
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.240]   Where it's like that, if the economics of that could work out, that's exactly what I
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240]   would do.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.680]   I would work all day and do homework for 10 years until I had a book because it's so exciting
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.680]   and thrilling to me.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.500]   I think it was wired that way.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:13.320]   My, you know, you asked about process, like I have specific things I do, but broadly the
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:22.080]   process is I treat this, I treat like all of these books as sort of with like a level
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.960]   of sort of, I think about Caro and I often ask myself like, what would he do, right?
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.720]   Or what would like Stacey Schiff do, right?
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:35.480]   Or what would like, you know, Barbara Tuchman have done, like, it's like, I think about
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:39.280]   the people who I admire and I think about how they would have approached a project like
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.280]   this.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:45.840]   And that leads me to like seven days a week, watch every interview, contact everybody,
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.520]   try to do as much historical spade work as I can, right?
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.360]   I don't know why it works.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.360]   It works for me.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.760]   I think it's a personality thing too.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.880]   Like it, it's sort of, you have to be willing to be bored a lot.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.600]   Like you actually have to be willing to wake up and be bored a lot of the time because
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.160]   the, you know, it's only on like the 17th press release for x.com that you discover
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.040]   this little nugget about something, right.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.200]   Or a little name that is different, right.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:17.840]   I remember when I was looking at Elon's early company, Zip2, I printed out like all the
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.520]   Zip2 press releases that I could find and like, I would read them end to end, like kind
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.160]   of like just like trying to understand how Zip2 evolved as a company and then divine
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.920]   like how might that have affected Elon's development.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.880]   And there's this really great moment in one of the press releases that I ended up putting
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.880]   in the book.
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.880]   JavaScript debuts.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.480]   This is like a big event in computer science, like JavaScript is real now, right?
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.160]   And Dr. Lou Tucker, who is like the director of development or research or something at
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.640]   JavaScript, like has a line in this press release.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.240]   And I noticed that from the time the company launched to when, or the time Java launched
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:57.160]   to the time that Zip2 incorporated Java was very, very, like it was a short window, right?
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.040]   And it confirmed something that Elon had said, which is like one of the things that he was
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.840]   proudest of with Zip2 was that it was always technologically trying to move very fast and
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.680]   stay ahead of the curve.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.440]   And it, to me, it was like, he made that point and I was like, okay, everyone says that.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.480]   But then I saw the Java thing and I went and did the timeline on like when Java launched
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.840]   and when Zip2 included it.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.960]   And I was like, oh, like there's real meat to that, to that statement.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.440]   There's real substance there.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.200]   I can imagine that for a lot of people listening, like reading 17 Zip2 press releases is like
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.600]   their idea of like torture, right?
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.560]   But for me, like having these big stacks of paper around my house that I'm like making
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.460]   my way through is actually like, it's so thrilling.
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:41.240]   You feel like you are like on an exciting adventure if you're me, right?
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:46.440]   I say that a lot, I'm like, it sounds ridiculous, but you really do feel that way.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.600]   And so that's the cool part.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:51.680]   The cool part is actually not interviewing, like, you know, the interview, interviewing
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:52.680]   them was fun.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.920]   And I learned a lot from my interviews with these people, but the more, the bigger thing
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.320]   was discovering these tiny discoveries about like how these things were, how these things
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   fit together.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:06.120]   An email from a user where they're really angry and I'm like, oh, this is, this is gold.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.920]   Or like some customer service spreadsheet, right?
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.240]   Where you can see the number of customer service calls and I'm like, oh my God, I have the
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.720]   number of customer service calls.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.320]   That's insane.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.360]   I get a thrill out of that.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.640]   Doing that is, I can't do it on Twitter.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.480]   I can do it over years on a specific kind of project.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.480]   And I just love it.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.800]   I mean, I love the heck out of it.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.000]   And I, you know, I loved it too.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.120]   I mean, like you said, with the Java thing, you know, one of the things I really, really
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.080]   liked the book was, you know, as a, as a computer nerd, it was just so fun to read.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.520]   Like, how are people thinking in the nineties about like a trade-off between using Unix
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   and Windows?
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.360]   And, you know, you did a great job of like covering like, cause you know, these kinds
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.000]   of trade-offs exist even today, right?
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.760]   People have to make decisions about like, do we use this new technology or do we use
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.800]   one that has all these APIs built into it?
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.320]   And you go into like great detail on this and it was like such an interesting part of
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   the book.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:06.040]   So, but anyways, so the book is the founders, the story of PayPal and the entrepreneurs
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.280]   who shaped Silicon Valley.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.520]   I highly, highly recommend it.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.440]   It was, it's definitely been one of the best books I've read, at least in a long while.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:18.720]   So Jimmy, any, anything else you want to say, anywhere else people can find you or, and
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.720]   last notes.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   Well, no, I just, thank you.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.760]   Thank you for taking the time to do these interviews and to, to work, you know, to like
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.840]   share some of these things that I think the challenge of the kind of work that I do is
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:38.720]   that sometimes you, you have to neglect by definition, like some of the engagement with
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.880]   an audience, right?
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.360]   Because I kind of like need to keep myself walled off in order to do historical work.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.840]   And then you sort of emerge and like the world's totally changed or whatever.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:52.240]   And so I appreciate when enthusiastic people read the book and reach out and like can engage
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.240]   on it.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.600]   And like, what's also nice is you've read the other books in this space.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:01.200]   And so you're a super informed reader, which makes these conversations and dialogues really
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   fun.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.040]   So I just appreciate all the time and energy that you take to do this because it's not
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.040]   easy.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.040]   I know.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.880]   And as an author, I'm like, I, I really, I appreciate the, the Robert Carroll like approach
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.400]   to your interviews.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.360]   Well it's extremely nice of you to say given, given the rigor and your own preparation process.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.080]   So that compliment means a lot to me.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:20.920]   Thank you very much.
