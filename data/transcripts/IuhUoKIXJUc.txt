[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.800]   Well, on Monday on the podcast,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.120]   we open the week talking about gossip
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.640]   and why it's so tempting to speak badly
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.280]   about other people behind their backs
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.040]   in order to harm their own reputation.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.640]   And I'm still thinking about all the hard issues
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.400]   that we talked about in a very important
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.240]   and helpful episode.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.720]   If you didn't listen to it,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.360]   I would encourage you to do so.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.720]   Today, we talk about the grace
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.040]   of receiving personal criticism from others
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.480]   and learning from those criticisms
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.600]   for our own personal growth.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.840]   There are some incredibly vivid Proverbs on this theme,
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.120]   like Proverbs 17, 10.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.560]   "A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.720]   "than a hundred blows into a fool."
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.920]   Wow, so how do we receive rebuke
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.160]   as a wise man seeking greater wisdom?
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520]   And specifically, Pastor John, how do you do it?
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.280]   It's the question from an anonymous listener
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.280]   in Australia who asks this.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.120]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.520]   I was wondering how you deal
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.340]   with personal criticisms from others.
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.780]   How do you process them, learn from them,
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.840]   and determine which ones are accurate
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.960]   and which ones are not?
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.880]   - That question, of course, is all the more relevant
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.020]   in a day of social media
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.080]   when you not only have a few dozen people
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.720]   in your family and church or neighborhood
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.640]   or network at work who might criticize you
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.980]   and you can deal with face to face,
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.780]   but you have a few million people
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.200]   who might get wind of your opinion on Twitter
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.360]   or Facebook or blog or wherever you happen to be talking.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.840]   They might get wind of your opinion
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.680]   and call you the most vile names in the world.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.800]   In one sense, this world of social media is unrealistic
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.160]   because we simply can't deal seriously
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.320]   with thousands of opinions about ourselves.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.060]   And yet, on the other hand,
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.060]   this world of social media is a glimpse into reality
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.640]   because it does give a clearer sense
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.500]   of how divided the world really is
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.880]   and how deeply we would be hated
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.420]   if more people knew what we believe about Jesus.
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.280]   And I call it a glimpse into reality
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   because Jesus himself said in Matthew 24, 9
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.360]   that we would be hated by all nations.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.680]   And if you just operate among five or 10 people,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.840]   you don't have any sense of that.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.480]   But if you go online, you do.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.020]   You do get a sense of being hated by all nations.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.020]   So here's my strategy of dealing with criticism.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.200]   And for whatever it's worth,
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   I hope it helps this listener from Australia.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.280]   Number one, realize that according to Scripture,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   it is wise to be eager to grow through rebuke
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.500]   rather than eager to defend yourself.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.320]   Proverbs 19, 20, listen to advice,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.720]   accept instruction that you may gain wisdom in the future.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.040]   Proverbs 17, 10, a rebuke goes deeper
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.920]   into a man of understanding than 100 blows into a fool.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.840]   Proverbs 9, 8, reprove a wise man and he'll love you.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.760]   Proverbs 19, 25, reprove a man of understanding.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.960]   He will gain knowledge.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.080]   Psalm 141, 5, let a righteous man strike me.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.560]   It is kindness.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.640]   Let him rebuke me.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.080]   It is oil from my head.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.000]   Let my head not refuse it.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So it's wise to want and receive correction,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.340]   rebuke, criticism.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.340]   Number two, I try to make it my aim to be humble and open
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.080]   rather than being controlled by anger at words of criticism.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.880]   I say, I try.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.360]   James 3, 17, but the wisdom from above is first,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.320]   pure, peaceable, gentle, open to reason.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.440]   I love that little phrase
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.140]   because the Greek word open to reason there is persuadable.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.900]   In other words, you've just said something,
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.640]   somebody disagrees, they say something back to you
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.020]   and you are persuadable.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.200]   That is, you're gonna listen.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.000]   You are willing to be changed if you're wrong.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.140]   Or James 1, 19, my beloved brothers,
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.640]   let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.880]   slow to anger.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.820]   The anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.820]   So humility listens, anger pushes back real quickly.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.880]   Let's strive to be humble and not quick
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.120]   and self-defensive in anger.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.120]   Number three, when I feel knocked off balance by criticism
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.280]   or deeply destabilized, which can really happen,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.560]   it can go really deep sometimes and shake you deeply,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.560]   I pray for God to hold onto me and guide me
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.300]   and I try to trust his promises.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.260]   So Psalm 139, nine, I take,
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.820]   if I take the wings of the morning
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.700]   and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea,
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.620]   even there, your hand shall lead me
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.220]   and your right hand shall hold me.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.620]   I really need to feel that God is holding me
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.620]   if I'm being pummeled by somebody or hundreds
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.500]   and feel like I'm being knocked off balance in my life.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.380]   Or Psalm 25, 15, my eyes are ever toward the Lord.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.660]   He will pluck my feet out of the net.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.980]   If I feel like I'm getting all netted
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980]   and obstructed and confused, I turn to God's promise,
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.900]   he will pluck your feet out of the net.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.780]   Or Psalm 25, eight and nine, good and upright is the Lord,
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.340]   therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.100]   He'll instruct me, he'll help me know what criticism
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.020]   is to be embraced and which ones I have to let go.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.380]   He leads the humble in what is right,
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.020]   he teaches the humble his way.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.140]   Or Psalm 25, 14, the friendship,
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.120]   and the literal translation there is the inner counsels,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.800]   the friendship, the counsel of the Lord
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.660]   is for those who fear him,
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.420]   and he makes known to them his covenant.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.300]   So I wanna draw near to God in reverential fear
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.540]   and believe he's going to give me stability,
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.100]   he's gonna pluck my feet out, he's gonna hold onto me,
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.020]   he's going to instruct me and get me through
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.380]   this emotional mess of criticism.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.380]   Number four, I try to test everything by the word of God,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.000]   not just by my preferences or tradition.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.980]   And that includes testing not just ideas,
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.900]   but also attitudes and behaviors.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.060]   Test everything, hold fast to what is good,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.760]   1 Thessalonians 5, 21, or Psalm 119, 24,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   your testimonies are my delight, they are my counselors.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.940]   So what if you're criticized for being unloving?
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.520]   1 John 5, 2 is a real stabilizing help.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   It says, "By this we know that we love the children of God,
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.360]   "when we love God and obey his commandments."
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.360]   In other words, the measure is not just my feeling wobbly
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.680]   right now that I just got criticized
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.120]   for being loving or unloving,
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   the question is, was I in obedience to his commandments,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.100]   his word, was I following his word
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.860]   when I said what he said or did what I did?
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.020]   So measure the criticisms by the word of God.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.200]   Number five, this is so practically important,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.240]   for me anyway, give yourself time
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.500]   to consider the criticism before you speak,
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.180]   because the flesh, my flesh,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.460]   is quick to strike out in defense.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.360]   And I'm thinking, first, Tony, of marriage.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.380]   (laughing)
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.980]   The person who corrects me most often
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.340]   in the universe is my wife, all right?
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.260]   And my guess is most spouses would say this,
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.640]   because you drive together
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.440]   and she didn't think you should make that turn
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.920]   or the way you, whatever, you know.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.700]   Well, here's Ecclesiastes 7, 8, and 9.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.080]   Better is the end of a thing than the beginning.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.900]   And the patient in spirit
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.360]   is better than the proud in spirit.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.360]   Be not quick in your spirit to become angry,
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.840]   for anger lodges in the heart of fools.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.520]   Ecclesiastes 7, 8, and 9.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.520]   Oh, how many times I have struck out quickly
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.580]   in self-defense toward Noel, my wife,
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:37.500]   and had to eat my words within 10 minutes
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.680]   because she was right.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:47.280]   A quick tongue is notoriously unreliable.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.640]   Give yourself time.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   Don't have knee-jerk, self-defensive reactions.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.900]   Try to kill that impulse.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.400]   The flesh does not like to be criticized
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.880]   and lashes out quickly, but the spirit is gentle
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.020]   and you give the spirit time,
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.560]   he will reveal your sin or her sin,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.300]   and it will be dealt with in a godly way.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.000]   Six, surround yourselves with enough people
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.460]   who can give balanced assessment
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.880]   of what you're being criticized for.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.320]   Proverbs 11, 14, where there is no guidance
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.360]   of people falls, but in an abundance of counselors,
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.440]   there is safety.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.160]   And I would say safety, not just from outside,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.000]   but safety from your own despair
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.480]   over how many people have criticized you.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.720]   And there are 10 people who know you,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.000]   and if eight of them say, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.960]   you have not done what they say you have done,
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.040]   that's a huge stabilizing force.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.320]   This is especially true
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.160]   when assessing really serious criticism.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   We need to ask wise counselors whether they see in us
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.360]   the things we're being criticized for.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.520]   One last thing, number seven.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.520]   In the end, we do what Jesus did when he was abused.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.240]   This is whether it's true or not.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.840]   I mean, right or wrong, when we're criticized,
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.680]   he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.400]   First Peter 2, 23.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   For us, us sinners, that means we do not pass
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.880]   final judgment on ourselves,
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.140]   and others do not pass final judgment on us.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.140]   God has the final word in Christ,
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.640]   and it's our only hope that he would treat us graciously
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.360]   because of Christ.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.000]   None of us is without sin,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.640]   and therefore probably there's a grain of truth
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.520]   in every criticism,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.520]   but the gospel will keep us from sinking in despair.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.400]   - Yeah, this is so important.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.480]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.340]   This is good balance here to listening to criticism
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.820]   and then drawing in others to help parse out
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.300]   what criticisms are most accurate.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.220]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.300]   a part of your week.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.560]   Three times a week we publish,
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.460]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.020]   and search our past episodes in our archive,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.020]   and even reach us by email with a question of your own,
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.020]   questions as they relate to friendship
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.340]   and the grace of giving and receiving rebuke.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.940]   You can do all that through our online home
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.300]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.480]   Well, I know a lot of you are listening
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.440]   on your drive to work or from work,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.740]   and we spend so much of our lives invested in working.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.060]   So how do we not waste our jobs?
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.240]   And how do we pursue excellence and pleasing God
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.080]   nine to five or eight to five,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   or whenever your shift starts and ends?
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.800]   That's the question on Friday when we return.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.000]   and thanks for joining us once again
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.280]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.160]   with longtime pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.360]   We'll see you next time.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
