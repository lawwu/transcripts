[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.940]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.820]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.980]   Today, we are discussing breathing.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.060]   Now, breathing is something that we are all familiar with
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.860]   because frankly, we are all doing it right now,
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.220]   and we do it during our waking states
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.140]   and while we are asleep.
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.460]   And most of us have probably heard
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.700]   that breathing is essential to life.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.420]   We hear that we can survive without food
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.460]   for some period of time, maybe even up to a month or more.
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.340]   That we can't survive that long without water,
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.000]   but we could survive a few days without water,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500]   depending on how well hydrated we are
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.580]   when we go into that water deprivation
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.580]   and the heat of the environment we happen to be in.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.200]   But that we cannot survive without breathing
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.620]   for more than a few minutes.
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.460]   That if we cease to breathe,
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.140]   that our brain and our bodily tissues will die.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.480]   And in fact, that is true.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.280]   However, despite everybody's knowledge
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.420]   that breathing is essential to life,
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.760]   I don't think that most people realize
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.420]   just how important how we breathe is
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.820]   to our quality of life.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.860]   And that includes our mental health,
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.060]   our physical health, and what we call performance.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.220]   That is our ability to tap into skills,
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.140]   either physical or cognitive,
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.900]   in ways that we would not be able to otherwise
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.540]   if we are not breathing correctly.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.900]   So today we are going to talk about
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020]   what it is to breathe correctly,
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.060]   both at rest, during sleep,
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.900]   in order to reduce our levels of stress,
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.140]   in order to wake up or to become more alert deliberately,
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.380]   and many, many other things,
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.780]   including how to stop hiccupping.
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.500]   This is one of the most searched for topics on the internet.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.180]   Today, I will teach you the one method
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.660]   that is actually linked to science.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.700]   No, it does not involve drinking a glass of water backwards
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.300]   from the opposite side of the cup
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.860]   or holding your breath in any kind of esoteric way.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.460]   It actually relates to the neural mechanisms,
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.820]   that is the brain to body connections that cause the hiccup.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.380]   Hiccup is a spasm of that neural circuit,
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.660]   and I'll teach you how to turn off
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.300]   that neural circuit in one try.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.180]   And that's not a technique I developed.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420]   It's a technique that's actually been known about
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.300]   for several centuries,
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.580]   and we now know the underlying mechanism.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.860]   So today's discussion will give to you many tools
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.540]   that you can apply.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.460]   All of these tools are, of course, behavioral tools.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.780]   They're completely zero cost.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.460]   And in telling you how those tools work,
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.820]   you'll learn a lot about how the breathing,
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.600]   AKA the respiratory system works,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.260]   and how it interfaces with the other organs and tissues
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.700]   of the body, in particular, the brain.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.580]   In fact, one of the most important things to understand
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.940]   about breathing right here at the outset
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.600]   is that breathing is unique among brain and bodily functions
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.460]   in that it lies at the interface
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.740]   between our conscious and our subconscious behavior,
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.660]   and it represents a bridge, literally, in the brain
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.380]   between the conscious and the subconscious.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.940]   What do I mean by that?
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.800]   Well, breathing does not require that we pay attention
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.440]   to our breathing or that we are even aware
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280]   that we are breathing.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.300]   It will just carry on in the background,
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.860]   either normally or abnormally,
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.100]   and I'll teach you what normal and abnormal breathing is
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.420]   in a little bit.
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.600]   However, breathing is unique among brain
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.620]   and bodily functions in that at any moment,
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.860]   we can consciously take control of how we breathe.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.780]   This is an absolutely spectacular
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.420]   and highly unusual feature of brain function.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.900]   For instance, your digestion is carrying on
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.920]   in the background right now,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.660]   whether or not you've had food recently or not,
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.940]   but you can't simply control your digestion
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.520]   by thinking about it in a particular way.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.580]   In fact, most people can't even control their thinking
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.780]   by trying to control their thinking.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.960]   That actually takes some practice.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.420]   It can be done, a topic for a future episode.
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.420]   However, breathing is unique.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.360]   Breathing will carry on involuntarily, subconsciously
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.040]   in the background, as I said before,
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.400]   but if at any moment you want to hold your breath
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.940]   or inhale more deeply or vigorously
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.760]   or exhale longer than you inhale, you can do that.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.620]   Very few, if any other neural circuits in your brain
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.100]   and body allow that level of control.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.740]   And it turns out that level of control is not an accident.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.940]   It has been hypothesized that by controlling breathing,
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.860]   the brain is actually attempting
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.180]   to control its own state of mind.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.620]   Now, the way this was originally stated
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.780]   in a scientific research paper
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.620]   was a little bit different.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.000]   It was a little bit more physiological.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.180]   The statement was the brain by regulating breathing
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.400]   controls its own excitability.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.900]   Excitability in the context of neurobiology
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.720]   is how able the brain is to take in new information or not,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.420]   how able the brain is or not to turn itself off
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.920]   to go to sleep and to regulate its own levels
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.620]   of anxiety, focus, et cetera.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.800]   If that seems a little bit abstract,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.120]   I'll make it simple for you.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.500]   By changing your pattern of breathing,
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.160]   you can very quickly change
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.680]   what your brain is capable of doing.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.860]   In fact, a little bit later,
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.320]   I'll tell you that while you inhale,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.560]   you are far better at learning and remembering information
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.580]   than during an exhale.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.060]   And it is a very significant difference.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.920]   Does that mean you should only inhale and not exhale?
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.100]   No, of course not.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.280]   I'll teach you how to breathe
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.140]   for the sake of learning and memory,
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.360]   as well as for physical performance
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.720]   and a number of other things.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.480]   So hopefully I've been able to highlight for you
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.060]   the importance of breathing, not just for life,
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.780]   because yes, breathing is essential for life,
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.360]   but that the subtleties of how we breathe,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.900]   the duration and intensity of our inhales and our exhales,
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.560]   how long we hold our breath between inhales and exhales,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.320]   very critically defines our state of mind
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.480]   and our state of body,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.960]   what we are able to do and what we are not able to do.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   And the great news is we can control our breathing
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.360]   and in doing so control our mental health,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.200]   physical health and performance.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.720]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.420]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.140]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.660]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.780]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.660]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.600]   Our first sponsor is HVMN.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.080]   HVMN, which is a supplement that increases ketones,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.860]   can be used in the context of a ketogenic diet.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.220]   However, many people, including myself,
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.100]   find that increasing blood ketones
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.700]   by using a supplement such as HVMN
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.380]   can greatly improve cognitive ability and physical output
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.640]   for mental work and for exercise,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.720]   even when not on a ketogenic diet.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.400]   There's a lot of research supporting the fact
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.340]   that even if you are consuming carbohydrates
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.200]   and you are not in ketosis,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.960]   that is you are not following a ketogenic diet,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.160]   consuming supplements that can increase blood ketones
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.280]   can allow you to think more clearly for cognitive work
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.920]   and physical work for that matter,
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.360]   perform at greater output for things like
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.620]   resistance training and endurance exercise.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.260]   And indeed, that's what I've found.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.120]   So I use it largely for preparing for podcasts
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.300]   or other aspects of my scientific work
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.720]   and sometimes prior to workouts,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.340]   especially if I'm working out
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.420]   having not consumed any food prior,
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.360]   I find that I have a lot more energy.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.340]   It also has the property of suppressing hunger.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.780]   If you'd like to try ketone IQ,
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.740]   you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20%.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.500]   Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.520]   to save 20% off your order of ketone IQ.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thiesis.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.060]   Thiesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.440]   And as many of you have probably heard me say before,
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.340]   I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.900]   because nootropics means smart drugs.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.660]   And frankly, the brain doesn't work that way.
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.020]   The brain has neural circuits for focus.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.400]   It also has neural circuits for creativity
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.360]   and neural circuits for task switching
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.840]   and for imagination and for memory.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.860]   There is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.660]   And therefore the word nootropics
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.740]   doesn't really apply to anything specific
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.500]   neurobiologically speaking.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.140]   Thiesis understands this
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.340]   and therefore has designed custom nootropics
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.600]   that are tailored to your unique needs.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.500]   I've been using Thiesis for over a year now
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.400]   and their nootropic formulas have been a game changer for me
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.300]   in particular in the realm of cognitive work.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.980]   My go-to formula for when I'm doing any kind of cognitive
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.660]   work is their clarity formula.
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.260]   That's the one I've been using most often lately.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.980]   If you'd like to try Thiesis customized nootropics,
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.300]   you can go online to takethiesis.com/huberman.

[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.380]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Whoop.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.980]   Whoop is a fitness wearable device
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.340]   that tracks your daily activity and your sleep,
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.940]   but goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.960]   on how to adjust your training and sleep schedule
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.420]   to perform better.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.300]   I've been working with Whoop
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.120]   on their scientific advisory council
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.140]   to help Whoop evolve their mission
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.260]   to improve the way that people are sleeping
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.940]   and thereby to improve their levels of focus,
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.620]   mood and alertness and performance
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.540]   in all endeavors during the day.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.860]   As a Whoop user, I've experienced the health benefits,
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.420]   the focus benefits, essentially all of the major benefits
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.520]   that come with getting an excellent night's sleep
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.640]   on a consistent basis.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.420]   I've also learned from using my Whoop
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.140]   how certain daily activities like the timing of exercise,
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.360]   caffeine and a number of other things
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.760]   impact the depth, quality and duration of my sleep.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.920]   Whoop is one of those tools that can really help guide you
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.000]   and provide you with personalized data,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.540]   recommendations and coaching around your body
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.740]   and your overall health.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.140]   So it's not just about tracking sleep,
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.240]   it's about tracking all aspects of your activity and health,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.820]   and of course, including sleep.
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.060]   If you're interested in trying Whoop,
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.020]   you can go to join.whoop.com/huberman today

[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.500]   Let's talk about breathing.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.740]   And of course we breathe
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.420]   in order to bring oxygen into the body,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.220]   but we also breathe to remove certain things from our body,
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.020]   in particular carbon dioxide.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.060]   So the main players in today's discussion
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.740]   are going to be oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.880]   Now a common misconception is that oxygen is good
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.780]   and carbon dioxide is bad.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.620]   That's simply not the case.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.100]   Let's just take a step back from that statement
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.560]   and let's think about this.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.080]   When we breathe in, we are largely breathing in air
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.820]   in order to bring oxygen into our body.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.320]   And we can just stop right there and say,
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.780]   why do we breathe at all?
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.160]   Why can't we just get oxygen from the world around us?
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.020]   Well, it's because oxygen can't diffuse through our skin
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.840]   into the deeper cells of our body.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.460]   Other single cell and very simple organisms
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.360]   can actually bring oxygen into their system
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.000]   without the need to breathe.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.800]   But we have to breathe in order to bring oxygen
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.680]   to the cells that reside deep in our body.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.320]   In particular, our brain cells,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.400]   which are the most metabolically active cells in our body
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   require a lot of oxygen.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.600]   And those brain cells are sitting of course in the brain,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   which is encased in the cranial vault, the skull.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.960]   And so oxygen can't simply pass to those cells.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.880]   So we need to have a system
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.320]   that will deliver oxygen to those cells.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.000]   We also need a system,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.640]   which turns out to be the breathing or respiratory system
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.980]   that can offload or remove the gas
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.260]   that we call carbon dioxide.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.360]   Not because carbon dioxide is bad,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.740]   but because too much of it in our system is not good.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.220]   In fact, much of today's discussion
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.680]   will also center around the common misconception
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.600]   that carbon dioxide is something that we want to get rid of.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   You don't want to get rid of too much carbon dioxide
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.240]   or else you can't actually get oxygen
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   to the cells and tissues of your body in an efficient way.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.220]   So you need oxygen and you need carbon dioxide in your body.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.480]   You also need to be able to offload or remove carbon dioxide
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.360]   and bring in oxygen in the correct ratios
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.660]   so that you can perform the kind of mental functions
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.080]   and physical functions that you want to.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.800]   So if we just dial out even further,
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.360]   we say, what are the key components of breathing?
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.300]   What are the elements within the body
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.920]   that allow us to bring oxygen to the tissues and cells
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.120]   as is required and remove carbon dioxide from the body
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.040]   as is required and yet keep enough carbon dioxide around
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.840]   in order to allow oxygen to do its thing?
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.880]   Well, that breathing or respiratory apparatus
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.300]   has two major components
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.120]   and I'm going to just briefly describe those.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.800]   And as I do this, I really want to highlight the fact
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.320]   that anytime you're thinking about biology
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.800]   and physiology in particular,
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.600]   whether or not it's about the brain or the liver
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.640]   or the gut microbiome, it's useful to categorize things
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   either as mechanical mechanisms or chemical mechanisms.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.480]   Well, let's just take the analogy of hunger.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.660]   There are mechanical mechanisms
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.560]   that tell us when we should eat.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.100]   For instance, you have neurons, nerve cells in your gut
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.600]   that signal how stretched or non-stretched
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.040]   the walls of your stomach are, right?
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.820]   How full or how empty your gut is
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.440]   and send that information to the brain
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.220]   to make you feel to some extent hungry or not hungry.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.780]   In general, when our stomach is very full,
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.960]   especially if it's very distended, even with liquid,
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.120]   it suppresses our hunger.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.640]   Whereas when our stomach is devoid
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.200]   of that mechanical pressure,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.780]   especially for a number of hours,
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.000]   it tends to trigger hunger
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.120]   by signaling via neurons to the brain.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.440]   In addition, there are chemical signals
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.080]   that go from the gut to the brain.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.120]   For instance, we have neurons in our gut
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.660]   that can detect the presence of amino acids from proteins
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.740]   that we eat, fatty acids from the foods that we eat,
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.400]   the lipids, and sugars, different forms of carbohydrate.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.060]   The neurons in our gut are paying attention to
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.500]   or respond to how much amino acid, fatty acid,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.980]   and carbohydrate is in our gut
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.540]   and send signals to the brain
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.800]   to either stimulate or suppress hunger.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.680]   So those are chemical signals
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.140]   that are being passed from gut to brain
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.640]   and they work in parallel with the mechanical signals.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.360]   And this idea of in parallel with,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.280]   again, is a very common theme in biology,
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.660]   especially neuroscience.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.760]   The term parallel pathways refers to the fact
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.980]   that anytime there's a critical bodily function,
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.800]   it's very unlikely that just one type of information,
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.900]   like just mechanical information is going to be used.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.280]   Almost always, it's going to be mechanical
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.160]   and chemical information.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.180]   I could pick a number of other examples.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.180]   For instance, if you want to avoid damaging your skin
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.000]   or other tissues of your body, which is essential to life,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.240]   well then you have mechanical information about,
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.540]   for instance, whether or not something is pinching
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.800]   or ready to pierce your skin, that's mechanical information.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.020]   It's sent via specific neurons up to the brain
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.020]   to signal a retraction reflex.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.260]   If you move your limb away
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.420]   from wherever that intense pressure is coming.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.620]   You also have chemical sensing in your skin,
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.500]   the presence of things that elicit a burn
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.220]   or that elicit itch or that elicit extreme cold.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.860]   All of that chemical information is being signaled
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.340]   up to the brain as well in parallel.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.240]   So parallel pathways is a common theme.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.980]   So when we're thinking about the respiration,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.320]   AKA the breathing system,
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.160]   we also need to look at the mechanical system.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.460]   What are the different components of the nose, the mouth,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.620]   the lungs, et cetera, that allow oxygen to be brought in
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.080]   and carbon dioxide to be removed from the body,
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.380]   but not too much carbon dioxide removed
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.060]   to allow breathing to work as efficiently
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.460]   and as optimally as possible.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.880]   And then we also need to look at the chemical systems
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.940]   of the lungs, the bloodstream,
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.100]   and how different cells use oxygen and carbon dioxide
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.660]   in order to understand that as well.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.460]   If you can understand the mechanical
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.620]   and chemical aspects of breathing,
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.800]   even just at a top contour,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.840]   well then the various tools that I discussed
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.300]   during today's episode,
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.220]   such as the ability to calm yourself down most quickly
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.560]   by doing what's called a physiological sigh.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.180]   I'll go into this in more detail in a little bit,
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.660]   but this is two very deep inhales through the nose.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.620]   So the first one is a long inhale.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.500]   And then the second one after that is a quick,
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.100]   sharp inhale to maximally inflate your lungs,
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.220]   followed by a full exhale through the mouth
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.180]   to lungs completely empty.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.440]   So it's big inhale through the nose,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.980]   then short inhale through the nose immediately after that
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.140]   in order to maximally inflate the lungs.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.940]   And then a long exhale through the mouth
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.100]   until your lungs are empty.
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.600]   You will understand why that particular pattern
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.420]   of breathing and not simply one inhale,
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.260]   or not simply an inhale through the nose
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.880]   and an exhale through the nose as well,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.220]   is optimal for reducing your stress quickly.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.740]   That double inhale through the nose
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.260]   followed by a long exhale through the mouth
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.740]   works to reduce your levels of stress
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.700]   and lower your levels of so-called autonomic arousal
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.340]   very fast in real time.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.580]   And it works better than any other known approach.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.620]   It's not a hack.
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.080]   This is actually something that your body
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.100]   has specific neural circuits to do.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.020]   And it actually performs during sleep on a regular basis
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.220]   and even throughout the day.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.500]   And that you can perform voluntarily.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.460]   And it works so well to reduce stress very quickly,
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.740]   not because it brings in the maximum amount of oxygen
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.740]   and removes the maximum amount of carbon dioxide,
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.580]   but rather because it optimally balances
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.340]   oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.720]   If you understand the mechanical
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.700]   and chemical aspects of breathing,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.300]   then you will understand exactly why
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.920]   that particular pattern of breathing,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.880]   the so-called physiological psi,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.940]   is the most efficient way to rapidly reduce stress
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.980]   in real time.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.300]   If you can understand the mechanical
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.000]   and chemical aspects of breathing,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   you will also understand why most people are over-breathing,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.900]   that is they're breathing too often,
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.380]   even if they're breathing in a shallow manner,
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.460]   they're breathing too often,
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.340]   and they are blowing off or removing too much carbon dioxide.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.780]   And if you understand that carbon dioxide is critical
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.420]   for the way that oxygen is delivered from the bloodstream
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.280]   to the tissues of the body, including the brain,
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.140]   well, then it will make very good sense
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.000]   as to why people who are breathing too much
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.820]   don't actually experience all the effects of elevated oxygen
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.780]   but rather they're putting their body
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.480]   into what's called a hypoxic state.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.420]   They're not getting enough oxygen
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.860]   to the tissues of their body, in particular, their brain.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.140]   And this is true not just for people
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.780]   who are obese or who suffer from sleep apnea,
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.880]   or although that's certainly the case,
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.120]   but for people that have, believe it or not,
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.720]   certain personality types.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.540]   We'll talk about breathing and personality type
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.340]   and actually how breathing has been shown
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.500]   to alter personality, that's right.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.380]   Breathing can alter personality in positive ways
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.020]   that allow anyone to show up to the various social
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.540]   and non-social endeavors of their life with more calm,
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.700]   more focus, alertness, and improve their overall health.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.920]   Okay, so let's talk about the mechanical components
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.760]   of breathing.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.380]   It's really quite simple.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.920]   You've got your nose, obviously, and you've got your mouth.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.280]   And a little bit later, we'll talk about
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.980]   the incredible advantages of being a nasal breather
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.780]   most of the time, but also the incredible advantages
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.380]   of using your mouth to breathe both for inhales and exhales
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.400]   during particular types of endeavors.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.620]   And we'll get back to that a little later.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.080]   But for the meantime, the only two ways to bring air
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.700]   into your system are through your nose
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.740]   and through your mouth.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.000]   We also have the larynx, which is a rigid tissue or pipe
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.360]   that brings the air from the nose and mouth
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.240]   down to the lungs.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.060]   Now, that word rigid is really important here
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.340]   because what we will soon learn is that your lungs
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.620]   basically act like a pump.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.700]   You sort of know this already,
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.860]   but these are two big bags basically that can fill with air
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.660]   or that can squeeze air out.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.060]   Now, what most people don't realize is that the lungs
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.300]   are not just two big bags of air.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.660]   Your lungs are actually two big bags of air
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.740]   that inside of them have hundreds of millions
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.960]   of little sacs that are called the avioli of the lungs.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.560]   And by having those hundreds of millions of little sacs,
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.820]   you increase the surface area of the lungs.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.660]   And by increasing the surface area,
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.620]   you allow more oxygen to pass from the air in your lungs
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.820]   into the bloodstream than if you didn't have those sacs.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.740]   And you allow more carbon dioxide to move
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.380]   from the bloodstream into those sacs of the lungs.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.300]   And then when you exhale,
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.160]   the carbon dioxide can be removed, okay?
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.580]   So those little sacs we call avioli of the lungs
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.860]   are an important part of the mechanical aspect of breathing.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.740]   We'll get to a little bit later.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.020]   Okay, so at a first pass,
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.440]   the mechanical aspects of breathing
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.580]   are really straightforward, right?
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.500]   You can breathe through your nose.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   You can breathe through your mouth.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.600]   It goes down through the larynx.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.800]   I told you the larynx is a rigid pipe.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.960]   The lungs are not rigid.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.400]   They can expand and they can contract like a pump
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.300]   to bring in air or to expel air.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.220]   Now, keep in mind that the lungs
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.460]   do not have any muscles themselves.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.880]   So we need muscles that can either squeeze the lungs
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.380]   or that will allow the lungs to expand.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.940]   And there are two general groups of muscles that do that.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.620]   And they are the diaphragm
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.020]   and the so-called intercostal muscles.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.980]   The diaphragm is a thin muscle that sits below the lungs
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.660]   and above the liver.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.900]   And when we inhale,
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.180]   provided that we are using
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.540]   what's called diaphragmatic breathing,
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.020]   that diaphragm contracts.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.020]   And when it contracts, it moves down,
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.760]   which allows more space for the lungs to inflate with air.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.460]   Now, the intercostal muscles
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.460]   are the muscles between our ribs.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.120]   A number of people probably don't realize this,
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.900]   but your ribs, of course, are bone,
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.780]   but in between those bones, you have muscles.
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.660]   And the intercostal muscles, when you inhale, contract,
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.160]   and that allows your rib cage to move up
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.820]   and to expand a bit.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.700]   And I think, again,
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.620]   people probably don't realize
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.220]   that your ribs are not fixed in place.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.100]   They can actually get further
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.060]   and closer apart from one another.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.140]   So when you inhale, your rib cage actually moves up.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.620]   Sometimes the shoulders will move up as well.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.740]   And that's because those intercostal muscles
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.020]   are contracting.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.940]   Now, muscles can't move on their own.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.660]   They are controlled by nerves.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.300]   So we've got the nose, the mouth, the larynx, and the lungs.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.980]   The lungs have all those little avioli in them.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.820]   And as I told you,
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.820]   we've got the diaphragm as a muscle to move the lungs,
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.860]   and we have the intercostal muscles to move the ribs,
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.740]   which can allow the lungs to expand.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.020]   Again, we're just on the mechanical components of breathing,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.120]   but because muscles can't move themselves,
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.220]   you should be asking what moves the muscles.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.460]   And it's really nerves that control muscles.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.020]   So whether or not you're contracting your biceps
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.580]   or you're walking and you're contracting your quadriceps
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.720]   and your hamstrings and your calf muscles,
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.500]   it's neurons, nerve cells that control that.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.180]   There's a specialized nerve called the phrenic nerve,
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.160]   P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.700]   that comes out of the neck.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.220]   And when I say it comes out of the neck,
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.780]   what I mean is that they're little neurons
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.260]   that reside in the brainstem, in the back of your brain,
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.060]   and they send little wires that we call axons
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.860]   down and out of the neck.
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.220]   They go through close to the heart
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.460]   and a little bit behind it,
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.960]   and they go down and they form synapses.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.180]   That is, they form connections with the diaphragm.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.980]   And when those neurons release neurotransmitter,
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.820]   which are little chemicals,
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.340]   the diaphragm contracts and it moves down.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.820]   So we say that the phrenic nerve is a motor nerve.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.960]   It's designed to move muscle.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.780]   However, the phrenic nerve,
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.640]   like a few other nerves in the body,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.180]   is interesting in that it has not just motor nerves
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.260]   in there, neurons that control the contraction of muscles,
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.900]   it also can sense things.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.180]   There has sensory neurons.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.340]   So it also sends connections down to the diaphragm
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.620]   and actually down deep into the diaphragm
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.160]   and close to the liver.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.700]   And note that I said liver twice now already,
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.760]   and we're going to get back to this later
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.180]   when we talk about physical movement and cramps of the body.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.260]   Those sensory neurons dive deep into the diaphragm,
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.220]   and then they go back up to the brain
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.340]   and they allow you to sense where the diaphragm is.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.740]   So they're giving information
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.740]   about where the diaphragm is in your body.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.760]   Now, most of the time, you're not paying attention to this,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.220]   but right now you can actually try this,
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.820]   and I would encourage you to do this.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.860]   Diaphragmatic breathing is in many ways
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.380]   the ideal way to breathe
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.380]   and that it's the most efficient way to breathe.
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.100]   We'll talk about what we mean exactly
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.720]   when we say breathing efficiency later,
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.460]   but the diaphragm is designed to allow the lungs to expand
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.260]   or to contract the lungs to bring air into the body
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.000]   or to remove carbon dioxide from the body.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.200]   And if you want to know whether or not
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.100]   you're using diaphragmatic breathing, it's very simple.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.900]   If you inhale, probably best to do this through the nose,
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.300]   but you could do it through the mouth.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.340]   If you inhale and your belly moves outward on the inhale,
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.580]   well, then that phrenic nerve
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.900]   is controlling your diaphragm properly.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.260]   And then when you exhale,
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.300]   your belly should go in just a little bit.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.740]   That's diaphragmatic breathing.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.380]   Now, diaphragmatic breathing is talked about
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.740]   in the context of yoga.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.940]   It's often talked about as a way to calm down and so on.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.720]   But diaphragmatic breathing is just one mode
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.980]   by which your brain and the phrenic nerve
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.620]   can control muscle, the diaphragm,
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.660]   to control the mechanical aspects of the lungs
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.160]   to bring in air and expel air.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.000]   As I mentioned before,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.880]   you also have these muscles between your ribs
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.540]   or the intercostal muscles.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.820]   And there's a separate set of nerves
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.460]   that allow those muscles to contract
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.300]   and for your rib cage to expand
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.760]   in order to create more room for your lungs
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.660]   to get larger and fill with air
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.380]   or for your rib cage to contract a bit
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.040]   when those muscles relax in order to expel air.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.480]   I'd like to go on record by saying
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.120]   that there is no rule that diaphragmatic breathing
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.420]   is better than breathing where your rib cage moves.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.740]   This is a common misconception.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.900]   People say, "Oh, if your shoulders are going up and down
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.900]   and your rib cage is moving while you're breathing,
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.140]   well, then you're not breathing right.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.740]   And if your belly goes out
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.360]   and the rest of your body is still while you breathe,
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.820]   well, then you're breathing correctly."
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.220]   I know of zero, in fact, zero minus one data
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.300]   to support that statement.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.800]   You have multiple parallel mechanisms
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.860]   to control the mechanics of your lungs and for breathing.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.500]   And when you're exerting yourself very hard,
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.740]   you tend to use both the intercostal muscles
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.500]   and your rib cage moving as well as your diaphragm
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.540]   in order to bring in a lot of oxygen
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.980]   and to offload a lot of carbon dioxide.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.220]   And when you're calmer,
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.200]   frankly, you could use diaphragmatic breathing
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.120]   or you could use rib cage type breathing
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.660]   in order to bring enough oxygen into your system.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.780]   There's no real data showing that diaphragmatic breathing
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.460]   is somehow better or worse.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.480]   However, being able to mechanically control
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.280]   those independently or to combine them
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.760]   and use them together is of tremendous power
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.160]   toward regulating your mental and physical states.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.760]   And we'll talk about how to do that a little bit later.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.680]   For right now, please understand
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.500]   that you have these different mechanical components
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.780]   that allow you to bring oxygen into your system
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.020]   and to expel air
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.360]   and to thereby offload carbon dioxide from your system.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.380]   Again, we haven't talked about the gas exchange
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.860]   of carbon dioxide and oxygen
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.020]   and how that's happening in the bloodstream.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.140]   We'll talk about that next.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.740]   But the basic mechanical components are pretty simple.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:25.700]   Once again, just to review,
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.100]   it's nose, mouth, larynx, lungs,
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.540]   avioli within the lungs, and then those two muscles,
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.220]   the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles of the ribs.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.320]   And one thing I failed to mention
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.100]   is why it's so important that that larynx be rigid,
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.740]   that it's a tube that is very rigid.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.380]   And the reason for that is that unlike the lungs,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.300]   which you want to act as sort of a bellow pump
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.180]   where you can deflate it and inflate it
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.760]   in order to move air in and out,
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.340]   the larynx needs to be rigid so that it doesn't collapse
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.860]   while you're bringing air in and out.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.380]   You can imagine that if it was a very flimsy tube
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.400]   or the walls of the larynx were very flimsy and thin,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.060]   well, then you can imagine breathing in very vigorously
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.580]   and it would shut like a tube
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.580]   that suddenly flattens on itself, which would not be good.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.660]   So the fact that the larynx is rigid
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.540]   is actually a very crucial part of this whole system.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.020]   The other important aspect of this system
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.300]   as it relates to the mechanics of breathing
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.740]   is the fact that your nose and your mouth
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.020]   have different resistances to air.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.260]   You can probably notice this right now
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.260]   if you were to, for instance,
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.940]   breathe in through your mouth and only through your mouth
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.700]   versus breathe in through your nose.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.540]   Some of you perhaps have a harder time
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.540]   breathing in through your nose.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.920]   By the way, it's perfectly normal
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.000]   that one or the other nostril
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.820]   would be harder to breathe through
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.660]   or easier to breathe through
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.160]   and that that switches across the day.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.120]   It has to do with the flow of mucus and cerebral spinal fluid
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.900]   and intracranial pressure, totally normal.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.200]   Many people out there think they have a deviated septum
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.000]   who don't actually have a deviated septum.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.960]   A little bit later, we'll talk about
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.480]   how to repair a deviated septum without surgery
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.240]   'cause that actually is possible in many, not all cases
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.860]   and is immensely beneficial to do.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.360]   But what we know is that breathing in through the nose
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.600]   is a little bit harder
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.280]   and it's supposed to be a little bit harder.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.200]   However, because it's a little bit harder
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.460]   because there's more resistance as we say,
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.220]   you're actually able to draw more force
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.960]   into these mechanical aspects of the breathing apparatus
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.600]   and actually bring more air into your lungs.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.200]   You can try this right now.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.680]   Try breathing in through your mouth
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.600]   to maximally inflate your lungs
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.840]   and try and do it through mostly diaphragmatic breathing
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.200]   just for sake of example.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.200]   In other words, try and breathe in through your mouth
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.040]   and as you do that, have your belly expand
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.440]   and maximally inflate your lungs.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.320]   I'll do it right now with you
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.160]   so that we can do it together
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.760]   and I can prove to everyone
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.680]   that I'm just as deficient in this as you are.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.240]   [gasps]
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.760]   Okay, so I can inflate my stomach doing that
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.640]   but now try doing it with your nose
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.920]   and please do exhale before you try doing it with your nose.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.680]   With your nose, you're going to feel more resistance
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.520]   but you'll notice that you can inflate it
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.540]   quite a bit further.
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.600]   And you'll feel your entire cavity, your belly
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.160]   and maybe even in your lower back
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.820]   sort of fill with some pressure.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.360]   So the increased resistance actually allows you
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.180]   to draw more air into the system.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.680]   This turns out to be very important
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.920]   and it also wipes away a common misconception
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.300]   which is if you're somebody who has challenges
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.520]   breathing in through your nose
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.460]   that somehow you should avoid breathing in
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.300]   through your nose.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.420]   Actually quite the opposite is true
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.000]   and we can go a step further and say
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.640]   that if you have challenges breathing in through your nose,
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.080]   chances are that's because the increased resistance
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.260]   of breathing in through your nose
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.000]   provided it's not completely occluded
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.360]   is going to allow you to bring more oxygen into your system.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.060]   This will turn out to be useful later
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.480]   when we explore different techniques for instance
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.800]   not just to calm down quickly
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.140]   but to elevate your energy quickly,
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.880]   to remove a cramp during exercise
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.580]   and a number of other things that breathing can be used for
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.080]   that can be immensely useful
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.620]   for mental and physical challenges.
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.140]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.060]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.520]   Athletic Greens now called AG1
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.880]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.780]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.460]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.680]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.280]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.360]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.340]   once or usually twice a day
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.940]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.040]   Our gut is very important.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.600]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.360]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.760]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.400]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.420]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.080]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.660]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.060]   vitamins and minerals that make sure
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.000]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.900]   and it tastes great.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.340]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.740]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.700]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.020]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.620]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.020]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.700]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.080]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.880]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.300]   So now let's talk about the chemical aspects of breathing.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.020]   And the two major players in this discussion are oxygen,
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.420]   which all the cells and tissues of your body need
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.240]   and carbon dioxide,
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.020]   which all the cells and tissues of your body need.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.820]   In fact, carbon dioxide plays critical roles
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.660]   in delivering oxygen to your cells.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.180]   And without carbon dioxide,
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.780]   you're not going to get enough oxygen
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.060]   to the cells and tissues of your body.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.000]   That said, if carbon dioxide levels are too high,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.140]   that is very problematic.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.720]   In fact, one of the ways
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.260]   that one can reliably induce panic in anybody
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.300]   is to have them breathe air
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.760]   that contains too much carbon dioxide.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.000]   So much so that for people that lack a so-called amygdala,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.460]   many of you have probably heard of the amygdala,
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.920]   this is a brain area that's associated with fear
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.000]   and threat detection,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.800]   even in people who completely lack amygdalas
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.060]   on both sides of the brain,
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.060]   because they were removed,
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.040]   because they had epileptic seizures there.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.500]   And therefore those people are completely unafraid
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.080]   of things that they ought to be afraid of,
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.560]   like heights, poisonous snakes,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.020]   any number of different things, dangerous to humans.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.420]   Well, if those people breathe
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.060]   an excess amount of carbon dioxide,
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.180]   they immediately have a panic attack.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.700]   What that tells us is that,
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.500]   again, there are parallel mechanisms,
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.580]   there's redundancy in the system to protect ourselves
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.340]   from having too much carbon dioxide in our system.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.240]   So we need enough carbon dioxide
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.160]   and enough oxygen in our system, but not too much.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.260]   The way that's accomplished is that, of course,
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.300]   we breathe in air, our lungs inflate.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.900]   And if you recall those little avioli of the lungs,
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.040]   those little sacs, oxygen can actually move from the air
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.660]   into those little sacs,
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.840]   and then from those little sacs into the vasculature.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.020]   The vasculature are the capillaries,
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.140]   the veins and the arteries of the body,
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.580]   because the walls of those little avioli
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.140]   are exceedingly thin,
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.500]   and they have tons of little capillaries
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.820]   that go into them and are all around them.
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:10.780]   So this is amazing, right?
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.180]   There's oxygen literally passing
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.740]   from inside of these little sacs in our lungs,
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.400]   'cause we inhaled the oxygen, from the air,
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.620]   into the bloodstream,
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.540]   and then that oxygen gets bound up by proteins in the blood,
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.140]   in particular hemoglobin,
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.660]   and hemoglobin then delivers oxygen
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.300]   to the very cells and tissues of the body.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.420]   However, oxygen can't just hop on hemoglobin
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.240]   and cruise along with hemoglobin
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.840]   until it gets to, say, your brain, and then hop off.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.040]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.100]   You require carbon dioxide
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.800]   in order to liberate oxygen from hemoglobin.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.380]   Carbon dioxide has this incredible property
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.300]   of actually being able to change the shape of hemoglobin.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.980]   Hemoglobin is shaped as a sort of a cage
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.900]   around oxygen molecules,
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.540]   and when it's in that cage shape,
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.580]   the oxygen can't be liberated.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.820]   So you've got oxygen and hemoglobin bound to one another
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.360]   moving through your bloodstream,
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.780]   but if a tissue needs oxygen,
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.840]   there needs to be carbon dioxide present
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.380]   to open up that cage,
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.860]   and that's what carbon dioxide does.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.360]   It allows that cage to change shape,
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.520]   and then the oxygen can be liberated
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.320]   and then can be delivered to the tissues,
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.760]   whether or not that's brain tissue or muscle tissue,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.460]   so on and so forth.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.380]   And so those are the major chemical components of breathing.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.280]   There are a few other aspects
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.920]   related to the chemical components of breathing,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.860]   such as the fact that carbon dioxide
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.860]   is strongly related to how acidic
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.800]   or how basic your body is in general.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.400]   So for instance, if carbon dioxide levels go way down,
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.300]   your blood pH goes way up.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.280]   That is, you become more alkaline.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.980]   Now, for many people, the word pH
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.180]   and the whole concept of pH
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.440]   immediately starts to evoke anxiety in and of itself.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.380]   pH is actually very simple.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.900]   You want the body basically to be at a pH of about 7.4.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.260]   There are some regions of your body,
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.660]   in particular along the gut,
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.100]   for which that number is importantly different
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.340]   in order for digestion to work properly.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.840]   You've all heard of the gut microbiome,
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.900]   the little microbes that provided you have enough of them
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.020]   and they're diverse enough allow your brain and body
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.020]   to function optimally at the level of immune system,
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.400]   hormone system, brain, et cetera.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.960]   Well, in the gut,
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.640]   you want the pH sometimes to be slightly more acidic
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.420]   because when it's more acidic,
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.180]   the little microbiota flourish
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.260]   far more than if it were more basic,
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.940]   but basically you want the rest of the body
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.460]   to be at about pH 7.4.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.080]   If carbon dioxide levels go too low,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.140]   the pH increases in a way that you might say,
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.180]   oh, well, that's bad,
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.540]   but that actually allows more oxygen to be available
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.380]   to the tissues of your body at least temporarily.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.620]   We'll talk about this a bit more later.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.260]   If I'm losing any of you, just hang in there
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.960]   because we're almost done with this whole business
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.100]   of the mechanics and the chemistry of breathing
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.500]   and then we can get into the tools
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.040]   and revisit some of this later
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.860]   to clean up any misunderstandings that may have arisen.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.040]   But as we're talking about carbon dioxide
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.900]   over and over again and how key it is to have carbon dioxide
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.620]   and the problems with it going too high or too low,
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.100]   you should probably be asking yourself
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.000]   what actually makes carbon dioxide go too low, right?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.220]   We know that we breathe in oxygen
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.860]   and then it can pass from the lungs
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.620]   and the avioli into the bloodstream
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.980]   and then we need carbon dioxide to liberate oxygen
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.800]   from the hemoglobin into the cells and tissues of the body.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.340]   And we know that when we exhale,
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.180]   or actually I haven't told you this yet,
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.260]   but you should know that when you exhale,
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.980]   carbon dioxide is actually taken from the bloodstream
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.620]   back into those avioli of the lungs.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.520]   And then when you exhale, it's expelled through your mouth
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.260]   or through your nose out into the world.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.920]   So the way I just described all that,
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.020]   inhale, bring in oxygen, exhale, expel carbon dioxide,
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.280]   pretty straightforward, right?
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.420]   Indeed it is.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.920]   And it also tells you that were you to exhale a lot more
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.500]   or a lot more vigorously,
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.580]   you would expel more carbon dioxide.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.520]   And in fact, that's exactly the way it works.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.660]   When you hyperventilate,
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.420]   of course you are inhaling more than usual,
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.460]   but you are also exhaling more than usual.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.220]   So you're of course bringing in more air
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.700]   and oxygen to your body,
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.360]   but you're also removing more carbon dioxide
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.760]   from your body than normal.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.600]   Carbon dioxide because of the ways
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.280]   that it regulates brain state,
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.180]   in fact, the way in which it regulates the excitability,
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.760]   literally the ability of your neurons
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.720]   to engage electrically or not,
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.160]   it can create states of panic and anxiety,
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.740]   which is why when you hyperventilate,
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.240]   you feel an increase in anxiety,
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.180]   or when you feel an increase in anxiety, you hyperventilate.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.780]   It's a reciprocal relationship.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:53.020]   In fact, I don't want anyone who has anxiety
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.340]   or who has panic attacks to try this now,
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.060]   but for most people, it's probably safe
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.020]   as long as you're not driving
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.840]   or doing something mechanical or operating machinery,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.500]   that is probably safe to do 25 or 30 deep inhales and exhales.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.300]   And you'll notice that by about breath 10,
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.920]   you'll start to feel tingly
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.060]   and you'll probably feel a little bit more alert.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:16.180]   And again, if you have anxiety or panic attack tendencies,
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.400]   please don't do this,
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.940]   but you will feel an increase in so-called autonomic arousal
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.080]   and increase in the activity
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.860]   of your overall sympathetic nervous system,
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.980]   which has nothing to do with sympathy,
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.420]   has everything to do with alertness.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.340]   You'll actually deploy adrenaline from your adrenals.
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.260]   So I'll just do this now.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.400]   You can try this now, again,
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.820]   provided you're in a safe place
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.240]   and you don't have anxiety or panic attack tendencies.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.460]   You will just breathe in through your nose
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.280]   and out through your mouth.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.340]   Remember, we're breathing in more and more vigorously
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.300]   and we're exhaling more and more vigorously
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.140]   than we normally would.
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:42.980]   It goes something like this.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.060]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.400]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.580]   Now, by breath eight or nine or 10,
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.380]   you'll notice that your body starts to heat up.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.560]   That's due to a couple of things,
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.540]   mainly the release of adrenaline from your adrenals.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.840]   I'm already feeling a little bit lightheaded.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.400]   The lightheadedness is actually because your vasculature,
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.620]   the capillaries and veins,
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.000]   and to some extent even the arteries of your body
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.080]   and particularly in your brain
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.560]   are actually starting to constrict.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.080]   So you're cutting off blood flow to the brain.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:12.960]   Why?
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.280]   Well, because carbon dioxide actually is a vasodilator.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.540]   Normally it exists in your body
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.860]   to keep capillaries, veins, and arteries dilated
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.100]   to allow blood to pass through them.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.220]   When you hyperventilate,
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.940]   sure, you're bringing in a lot of oxygen,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.300]   which you think would make you more alert,
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.460]   and indeed it does,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.660]   but you are also expelling a lot more carbon dioxide
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.620]   than you normally would,
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.740]   and that's causing some vasoconstriction,
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.980]   and you're going to start feeling tingly in the periphery
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   in your fingers and toes, perhaps, or your legs.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.780]   You will also notice that you're feeling more alert
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.620]   in the brain,
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.960]   but that you might start to feel a bit of anxiety.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.240]   So hyperventilation, yes, brings in more oxygen,
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.680]   also removes more carbon dioxide.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.020]   The removal of excess carbon dioxide puts you into a state
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.260]   that's called hypokapnic, all right?
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.760]   Hypoxia, hypoxia is reduced levels of oxygen
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.000]   relative to normal.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.340]   Hypokapnia is reduced levels of carbon dioxide
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.580]   relative to normal,
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.240]   and it is those reduced levels of carbon dioxide
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.180]   that are largely responsible for that elevation in energy
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.640]   and at the same time, a feeling of a bit of anxiety,
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.220]   the constriction of the microvasculature
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.460]   in the brain and body,
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.220]   and therefore the feelings of being kind of tingly
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.460]   and having kind of an urgency to move.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.260]   Okay, so by now it should be clear
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.780]   that we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide,
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.140]   and across the course of this episode,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.260]   I will explain how to adjust those ratios
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.200]   of oxygen to carbon dioxide,
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.020]   depending on what your immediate needs are
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.400]   and what you plan to do next,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.500]   whether or not that's sleep or exercise
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.560]   or some mental work, et cetera.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.400]   Before going any further, however,
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.580]   there is something I want to touch on
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.500]   because even though not everyone will experience this,
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.740]   I think enough people experience it
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.320]   that it is of interest and now's the right time
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.220]   to touch into what happens
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.980]   when you go up to a very high altitude,
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.620]   meaning why it's hard to breathe
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.420]   when you get up to high altitudes.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.500]   So if you're close to sea level,
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.460]   you are getting kind of the optimal balance
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.760]   of oxygen in the air you breathe.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.340]   As you ascend in altitude,
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.860]   so let's say you go to 6,000 feet or 10,000,
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.860]   or maybe even 11,000 feet above sea level,
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.820]   or maybe you're one of those rare individuals
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:24.500]   that climbs Denali or you climb Mount Everest
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.900]   and you get up there and you notice that, you know,
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.620]   most people are going to wear an oxygen mask.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.800]   Why is it that you need an oxygen mask
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.000]   at those very high altitudes?
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.900]   Or when people do these very high altitude skydives
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.460]   that they need oxygen way up high?
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.360]   Well, a lot of people will say,
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.100]   oh, there's not much oxygen up there.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.660]   You know, the air is thinner.
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.300]   Okay, well, perhaps a better way to think about it
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.540]   is that remember when we were talking
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.580]   about the mechanical aspects of breathing
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.600]   and the fact that the lungs don't really move themselves,
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.940]   that they have the muscles, the diaphragm
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.780]   and the intercostal muscles to move them?
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.340]   Well, a lot of the reason why your lungs
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.660]   can fill so readily with air
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.700]   is that when you don't have much air in your lungs,
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.840]   there's very low air pressure in your lungs
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.920]   relative to outside you, okay?
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   So what we mean then is if you were to open up your mouth
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.780]   or your nose and breathe in,
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.060]   that is breathe in through your nose or mouth,
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.800]   what's going to happen is air is going to move
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.300]   from high pressure to low pressure.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.780]   So it's very easy to fill your lungs.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.980]   Even though you need those muscles
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.900]   to move the various things around
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.420]   that allow your lungs to fill,
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.020]   the air is going to go from high pressure to low pressure.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.420]   So for those of you listening,
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.160]   I just took a big inhale through my nose.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.780]   And then when you exhale, right,
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.620]   you're basically taking the lungs from a state
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.460]   in which the pressure is really high in the lungs,
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.700]   high pressure, like a balloon that's full,
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.200]   and the pressure in your lungs when your lungs are full
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.680]   is higher than the air outside.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.460]   So it's pretty easy to expel that air
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.000]   through the nose or mouth.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.220]   When you're at high altitudes, the air pressure is lower.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.380]   And so what happens is when the air pressure
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.740]   is lower outside your body
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.600]   and your lungs are not full of air,
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.460]   you don't have that really steep gradient
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.880]   of high pressure outside the body
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.820]   to low pressure inside your lungs.
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.740]   And so you actually have to put a lot more effort
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.160]   into breathing air into your lungs.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.020]   You have to really exert a lot of force.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.380]   You have to get the diaphragm,
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.220]   those intercostal muscles working really hard.
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.580]   You might even find that your shoulders
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.020]   are lifting with each breath
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.660]   'cause you really have to generate a lot of force
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.180]   to get enough air and oxygen into your lungs.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.660]   Now, an important principle to understand
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:34.340]   is that in humans and in some other species,
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.180]   but really what we're talking about now as humans,
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.500]   when you inhale, that's an active process.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.420]   You really need to use those muscles of the intercostals
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.000]   and the diaphragm in order to inflate the lungs.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.380]   But the whole process is made easier
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.160]   when air pressure outside your body is higher
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.120]   than it is in your lungs
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.840]   because then they're going to fill up really readily.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.920]   Exhaling, at least for humans, is a passive thing.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.640]   You just have to relax the diaphragm
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.820]   and relax the intercostals and let the rib cage
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.540]   kind of fall back to its original position.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.380]   So inhaling is active and exhaling is passive.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.140]   And so what happens is if you're at a high altitude
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.020]   and the air pressure is very low,
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.020]   then you have to put a lot of energy
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.020]   into breathing air into your lungs
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.040]   to get an equivalent amount of oxygen into your lungs
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.500]   and then into the bloodstream.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.120]   So that's why when you arrive at a high altitude location,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.900]   for the first few days, you're going to feel lightheaded,
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.200]   maybe a headache.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.180]   You're also going to have more buildup
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.900]   of carbon dioxide in your system.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.060]   And so the whole balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.660]   is going to be disrupted.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.260]   I mention all that because yes, indeed,
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.220]   there are some changes in the atmospheric gases
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.140]   at high altitudes and that can impact
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.820]   how much oxygen you can bring into your system,
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.860]   into your tissues.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.900]   But I've heard many explanations of why it's hard to breathe
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.100]   or why you feel lousy at altitude.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.920]   Well, you just discovered one reason,
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.880]   which is that you don't have that steep high pressure
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.820]   to low pressure gradient from the outside of the body
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.120]   into the inside of the body.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.260]   The converse is also true.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.940]   If you've been at altitude for a few days
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.500]   and you've had the opportunity to adjust,
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.660]   a lot of athletes, for instance, will go train at altitude.
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.580]   It's hard for them in the first days or weeks,
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.900]   and then they get really good at training at altitude.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.660]   There are a number of different adaptations that occur
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.220]   in terms of the amount of oxygen
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.680]   that can be carried in the blood by hemoglobin
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.480]   and the interactions between carbon dioxide
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.080]   and hemoglobin and oxygen that allow more oxygen
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.980]   to be delivered to the tissues such that at altitude,
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.740]   you can function just normally.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.660]   But if you then move very quickly from altitude,
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.020]   say you've been training at 8,000 feet or 10,000 feet,
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.940]   you've been hiking up at the high level and you've adapted,
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.900]   and you come down to sea level,
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.980]   well, for about two to five days,
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.500]   you're going to feel like an absolute beast.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.140]   You're going to be able to essentially deliver
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:45.380]   far more oxygen to your muscles per breath.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.740]   In part, that is because of the way that the hemoglobin
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.200]   and the oxygen that it's carrying has been altered
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.160]   when you were at high altitude.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.560]   But it's also because when you were at that high altitude,
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.740]   those intracostal muscles and those diaphragms
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.760]   got trained up quite a bit and allowed you
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.640]   to generate more air volume for every breath.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.280]   In other words, those muscles got stronger
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.940]   and you got more efficient at driving the phrenic nerve
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.620]   consciously to really breathe in a lot of oxygen
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.840]   so you don't feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.300]   Okay, so that's a little bit of an aside,
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.020]   but it's an important aside, I believe,
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.080]   because A, it answers a question a lot of people ask
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.640]   and a lot of people wonder about,
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.520]   and B, because it incorporates
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.200]   both the mechanical aspects of breathing
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.040]   and the chemical aspects of breathing.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.820]   I realize it's a little bit of a unusual circumstance,
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.940]   but now if anyone asks you
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.200]   why it's hard to breathe at altitude,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.160]   you know it has to do with this lack of a high pressure
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.800]   to low pressure gradient across the body
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.480]   and with the atmosphere outside you.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.080]   It's also an opportunity for me to say
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.640]   that if you do find yourself at altitude
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.720]   and you have a headache
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.920]   or you're feeling like you just can't catch your breath,
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.480]   spending some time really consciously
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.960]   trying to draw in larger breaths of air,
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.680]   as much as that might seem fatiguing
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.800]   and you'll be short of breath,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.560]   it will allow you to adapt more quickly.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.680]   And a little bit later in the episode,
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.860]   we'll touch on a few methods,
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.840]   including deliberate hyperventilation
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.840]   combined with some breath holds
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.160]   that can allow you to deliver more oxygen to the cells
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.200]   immediately upon arriving at altitude
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.480]   so you don't get quite as much headache,
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.300]   disorientation and so on.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.680]   So leaving breathing at altitude aside,
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.820]   let's all come back down to the same conceptual level.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:14.180]   We can ask ourselves for instance,
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.080]   what is healthy breathing and what is unhealthy breathing?
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.200]   And the first place we want to tackle this
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.500]   is within the context of sleep.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.920]   So when we go to sleep at night,
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.200]   we continue to breathe, that's no surprise.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.400]   If we didn't, we would die during sleep.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.620]   However, there is a large fraction of the population
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.620]   that underbreathes during sleep.
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.440]   They're not taking deep enough or frequent enough breaths
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.520]   and therefore they are experiencing
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.840]   what's called sleep apnea.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.160]   They are becoming hypoxic, hypoxic.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.920]   There's less oxygen being brought into their system
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.040]   than is necessary.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.160]   People that are carrying excess weight,
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.000]   either fat weight or muscle weight or both
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.320]   are more prone to nighttime sleep apnea.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.000]   However, there are a lot of people who are not overweight
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.920]   who also experience sleep apnea.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.200]   How do you know if you're experiencing sleep apnea?
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.660]   Well, first of all, excessive daytime sleepiness
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.320]   and excessive daytime anxiety
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.000]   combined with daytime sleepiness
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.040]   is one sign that you might be suffering from sleep apnea.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.440]   The other thing is if you happen to snore,
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.840]   it's very likely that you are experiencing sleep apnea.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.320]   And I should mention that sleep apnea
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.360]   is a very serious health concern.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.560]   It greatly increases the probability
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.280]   of a cardiovascular event, heart attack, stroke.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   It is a precursor or sometimes the direct cause
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.860]   of sexual dysfunction in males and females,
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.080]   cognitive dysfunction during the daytime.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.560]   It can exacerbate the effects of dementia,
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.060]   whether or not it's age-related,
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.960]   dementia of the normal sort or Alzheimer's type dementia,
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   which is an acceleration of age-related cognitive decline.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.760]   If you're somebody who's had a traumatic brain injury,
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.160]   if you're experiencing a lot of stress,
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.400]   sleep apnea is going to greatly disrupt
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.960]   the amount of oxygen brought into your brain
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.240]   and body during sleep and is going to lead
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.280]   to a number of nighttime and daytime issues.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.180]   So it's something that really needs to be addressed.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.020]   And we'll get into this a bit more later,
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.840]   but since I raised it as a problem,
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.200]   I do want to raise the solution.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.040]   One of the major treatments for sleep apnea
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.660]   is that people will get a CPAP device,
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.580]   which is this face mask and a machine
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.420]   that they'll sleep with.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.240]   And while those can be very effective,
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.820]   not everyone needs a CPAP.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.040]   One of the more common methods nowadays
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.720]   that's being used to treat sleep apnea,
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.200]   which is purely behavioral and intervention
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.680]   and is essentially zero cost,
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.340]   is that people are starting to shift deliberately
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.640]   to nasal breathing during sleep
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.600]   because of the additional resistance of nasal breathing
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.140]   and because of the fact that there's far less tendency,
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.140]   if any, excuse me, to snore when nasal breathing.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.760]   Taping the mouth shut using medical tape prior to sleep,
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.200]   excuse me, putting medical tape on the mouth
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.180]   prior to going to sleep and then sleeping all night
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.380]   with medical tape on the mouth
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.620]   is one way that people can learn to nasal breathe
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.240]   during sleep and can greatly offset a lot of sleep apnea,
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.780]   snoring and sleep-related issues.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.320]   A number of people don't want to or don't feel safe
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.560]   putting medical tape on their mouth prior to sleep.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.180]   For some reason, they think they're going to suffocate,
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.180]   but of course you would wake up
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.280]   if you start to run out of air at any moment.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.900]   So that's not so much a concern.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.380]   But what they'll do is they will start to use
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.500]   pure nasal breathing during any type of exercise
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.140]   or even just for some period of time,
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.460]   walking during the day or while working.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:22.260]   And again, later, we'll get into the enormous benefits
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.460]   of shifting to pure nasal breathing
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:27.060]   when not exercising hard,
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.240]   meaning at a rate that you could normally
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.180]   hold a conversation.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.820]   Although if you're pure nasal breathing,
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.620]   you won't be holding that conversation.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.100]   Or when simply doing work or any number of things
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.840]   that are sort of low intensity,
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.460]   you can train your system to become a better nasal breather
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.700]   during the daytime through these deliberate actions
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.280]   of taping the mouth shut or just being conscious
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.360]   of keeping your mouth shut.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.080]   And that in addition to having a number of positive health
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.400]   and aesthetic effects during the daytime
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.840]   is known to also transfer to nighttime breathing patterns
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.380]   and allow people to become nasal breathers
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.580]   as opposed to mouth breathers during sleep
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.980]   and to snore less and to have less sleep apnea.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:04.620]   Again, if you have severe sleep apnea,
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.800]   you probably do need to check out a CPAP.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.280]   You should talk to your physician.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.420]   But for people who have minor sleep apnea or sleep apnea
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.200]   that's starting to take hold,
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.260]   these other methods of shifting to becoming a nasal breather
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.880]   are going to be far more beneficial
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.560]   and far more cost effective
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.020]   than going all the way to the CPAP.
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.320]   Which by the way, doesn't really teach you
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.660]   how to breathe properly as much as it does
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.540]   adjust the airflow going into your system.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.780]   That's an important point.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.740]   Then when you shift from mouth to nasal breathing
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.660]   during sleep, you're actually learning
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.820]   and training your system to breathe properly.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.840]   And when I say learning and training your system
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.660]   to breathe properly, what do I mean?
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.900]   Let's put some scientific and mechanistic meat on that.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.460]   We already talked about the phrenic nerve,
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.080]   this nerve that innervates the diaphragm
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.300]   and that allows for the lungs to fill up
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.960]   because of the movement of the diaphragm.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.820]   What we didn't talk about, however,
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.800]   were the brain centers that actually control
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.020]   the phrenic nerve and control breathing.
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.500]   Knowing about these two brain areas
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.840]   and what they do is extremely important,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.420]   not just for understanding the content of this episode,
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.940]   but for understanding all of the tools that we'll discuss
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.280]   and indeed your general health as it relates to respiration.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.340]   So there are basically two areas of the brain
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.500]   that control breathing.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.680]   The first is called the pre-buttsinger complex.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.040]   You don't have to worry about the name so much,
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.820]   just know that it was named after a bottle of wine
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.200]   and that it was discovered by the great Jack Feldman,
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.300]   who's a professor of neuroscience
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.380]   at the University of California, Los Angeles.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.020]   This is one of the most fundamental discoveries
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.060]   in all of neuroscience in the last 100 years or more
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.300]   because this brain area that Jack and his colleagues
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.140]   discovered controls all aspects of breathing
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.220]   that are rhythmic.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.020]   That is when inhales follow exhales,
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.220]   follow inhales follow exhales.
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.740]   That's all controlled by a small set of neurons
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.320]   in this brainstem area,
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.180]   so around the region of the neck
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.940]   called the pre-buttsinger complex.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:53.860]   And we really owe a debt of gratitude to Jack
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.900]   and his colleagues for discovering that area
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.580]   because it's involved in everything
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.420]   from breathing when we're asleep
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.780]   to breathing when we're not thinking about our breathing.
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.620]   It may have a role,
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.280]   that is when its function is disrupted,
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.300]   it may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.700]   Believe it or not, it can explain in large part
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:15.900]   many of the deaths related to the opioid crisis
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.340]   because exogenous opioids like fentanyl
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.700]   and other sorts of drugs, which are opioids obviously,
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:25.260]   bind to opioid receptors on that structure
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.100]   and shut it down.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.100]   Now, keep in mind,
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.740]   these neurons are designed to be incredibly robust
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.860]   and are designed to fire, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.100]   no matter if we're awake or aware,
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.300]   unaware or asleep to keep us alive.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.320]   Exogenous opioids like fentanyl
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.420]   and drugs that are similar to that
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.040]   can shut down that structure
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.500]   because it's rich with these opioid receptors,
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.380]   so it binds to that
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.300]   and it shuts off the pre-buttsinger complex,
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.620]   which is the major cause of death
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.220]   of people who die from opioid overdoses.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:56.380]   I think a lot of people don't realize that.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.340]   They think, oh, the opioids must shut off the brain
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.420]   or shut down the heart.
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.420]   No, it shuts down breathing.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.260]   So Jack's discovery, no doubt,
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.260]   will lead to some important things
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.840]   as it relates to addiction.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.780]   And hopefully, I think we frankly can expect
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.300]   that it's also going to eventually lead to ways
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.640]   to prevent death in people using opioids
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.580]   or other types of drugs,
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.760]   maybe by blocking opioid receptors
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.100]   in pre-buttsinger complex
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.340]   using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.960]   In any event, pre-buttsinger complex
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.300]   is controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.540]   to patterns of breathing.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.780]   The other brain center controlling breathing,
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.660]   again, through the phrenic nerve, right?
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.500]   It all converges and goes out through the phrenic nerve
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.180]   in these intercostal muscles.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.980]   Is the so-called parafacial nucleus.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.680]   And the parafacial nucleus is involved
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.300]   in patterns of breathing
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:44.660]   where there is not an inhale followed by exhale,
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.640]   inhale followed by exhale.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.140]   That is, it's not rhythmic one than the other,
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.600]   but rather where there is a doubling up of inhales
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.020]   or a doubling up of exhales
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.020]   or a deliberate pause in breathing.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:57.660]   So inhale, pause, exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale,
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:59.080]   pause, this sort of thing.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:54:59.920]   A little bit later,
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.220]   we'll talk about a pattern of breathing
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.120]   called box breathing,
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.720]   which has a very specific and useful applications,
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.320]   in particular for adjusting anxiety.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.680]   And in that case,
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.080]   it involves going from rhythmic breathing of inhale,
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.160]   inhale, inhale, exhale,
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.640]   that is relying on the pre-Buttsinger complex neurons
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.280]   to reliance on the parafacial nucleus neurons
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.140]   and box breathing,
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.960]   just to give away what's probably already obvious
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.360]   is you inhale, hold, exhale, hold, and repeat.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.720]   And that pattern of breathing,
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.400]   even though it's rhythmic in nature
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.700]   because inhales precede exhales, precede inhales, and so on,
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.800]   there's a deliberate breath hold inserted there.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.760]   So anytime we're taking conscious control of our breathing,
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.840]   the parafacial nucleus is getting involved.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.880]   Now you don't have to assume that the parafacial nucleus
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.280]   is the only way in which we take conscious control
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.100]   of our breathing.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.400]   We can also take control of the pre-Buttsinger complex.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   You can do that right now.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.220]   So for instance,
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.980]   you are breathing in some specific pattern now
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.280]   that unless you're speaking or eating,
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.000]   no doubt is going to involve inhales followed by exhales.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.320]   You could, for instance, decide that,
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.840]   yes, inhales are active and exhales are passive,
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.480]   but now you're going to make the exhales active as well.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.480]   So rather than just inhale and then let your lungs deflate,
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:14.740]   you could inhale and then force the air out.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:17.820]   That's going to represent a conscious taking over of control
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.480]   of the pre-Buttsinger complex.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:22.980]   Okay, so the reason I'm giving this mechanistic detail is,
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.700]   A, it's super important if you want to understand
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.040]   all the tools related to breathing.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.060]   B, it's actually a pretty simple system,
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:31.260]   even though the areas have fancy names
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.080]   like pre-Buttsinger or parafacial,
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.200]   it's pretty straightforward, right?
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.880]   You have one area that controls rhythmic breathing,
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:36.820]   inhale follows exhales,
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.940]   and the other area which gets involved in breathing
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.480]   anytime you start doubling up on inhales or exhales.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.120]   In fact, the parafacial nucleus is the one
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.260]   that you're relying on while you speak
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.860]   in order to make sure that you still get enough oxygen.
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.120]   It's also the one that you will use
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.620]   if you incorporate the physiological psi or box breathing.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.400]   And frankly, most of the time,
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.620]   you're using both of these circuits or these brain systems,
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.240]   parafacial and pre-Buttsinger, in parallel.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.980]   Again, biology loves parallel systems,
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.280]   especially for things that are so critical
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.080]   that if we didn't do them, we would die, like breathing.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.020]   And so it makes sense that we have
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:11.260]   two different brain structures that control this.
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.740]   So now you have an understanding
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:15.360]   of the mechanical control of breathing,
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:18.420]   that is the different parts within the parts list
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.420]   that are involved in breathing,
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.880]   everything from nose to mouth to avioli to lungs, et cetera,
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.160]   and the muscles involved in moving the lungs.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.140]   You understand, I like to think a bit
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:30.060]   about bringing oxygen in and removing carbon dioxide,
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.380]   but not so much carbon dioxide
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.340]   that you can't actually use the oxygen that you have.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.060]   And you know about two brain centers,
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.580]   one controlling rhythmic breathing
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.260]   and one that controls non-rhythmic breathing.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.780]   I want to repeat something
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.300]   that I said a little bit earlier as well,
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.420]   which is that breathing is incredible
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.100]   because it represents the interface
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.080]   between conscious and subconscious control
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.880]   over your, not just body, not just your lungs,
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.320]   but that how you breathe influences your brain state.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.360]   So by using your brain consciously
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.060]   to control your breathing,
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.640]   you are using your brain to control your brain.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.340]   The best way I've ever heard this described
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.340]   was from a beautiful, I should say now classic paper
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.560]   in the Journal of Physiology published in 1988
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.460]   from Ballesterino and Somjan,
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:20.240]   where the final line of their summary intro states,
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.400]   "The brain by regulating breathing
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.500]   controls its own excitability."
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.840]   And just to remind those of you
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:27.940]   that don't remember what excitability is,
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:32.400]   excitability is the threshold at which a given neuron,
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.180]   nerve cell can be active or not.
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:37.180]   So when we breathe a certain way,
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.400]   the neurons of our brain are more likely to get engaged.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.740]   They're more likely to be active.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:43.940]   And when we breathe in other ways,
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.140]   our brain becomes harder to activate.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.220]   Its excitability is reduced.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.260]   Now you might think excitability is a great thing.
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.080]   You always want your brain to be excitable,
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.480]   but that's actually not the case.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:57.140]   And in fact, that very statement
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:59.520]   that Ballesterino and Somjan made
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.640]   led to a number of other investigations
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.140]   that were really important in defining how
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.360]   if people over-breathe,
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.800]   that is if they hyperventilate at rest,
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:14.800]   they expel, that is they exhale too much carbon dioxide.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.520]   What that classic paper by Ballesterino and Somjan led to
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.320]   was a number of different investigations in humans
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.360]   looking at how different patterns of breathing
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.480]   impact the overall state of the brain
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.260]   and the ability of the brain to respond to certain
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.460]   what are called sensory stimuli.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.020]   Keep in mind that your brain is always active.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.160]   The neurons are firing at low level, low level, low level.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.080]   But when you see something or hear something,
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.700]   or you want to focus on something,
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:44.120]   or you want to exercise or really listen to something
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:47.080]   or learn, certain circuits in your brain
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.880]   need to be more active than everything else.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.360]   That is there needs to be really high
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.000]   what's called signal to noise.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.960]   There's always a lot of noise and chatter in the background,
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.220]   just like the chatter at a cocktail party
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:58.920]   or at a stadium event.
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.240]   In order to really pay attention, focus, learn,
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.220]   all the incredible things that the brain can do,
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.760]   you need that signal to get above the noise.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:11.200]   There's a beautiful paper that asks,
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.940]   how does the pattern of breathing,
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.200]   in particular, how does over-breathing
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:19.520]   change the patterns of activity in the brain?
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.680]   This is a paper entitled
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.420]   Effects of Voluntary Hyperventilation on Cortical Sensory
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.760]   Responses, and I will provide a link to the study
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.160]   in the show note captions.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.880]   It's a somewhat complicated paper
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.640]   if you look at all the detailed analysis.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.080]   However, the takeaway from this paper is exquisitely simple
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.900]   and I also believe incredibly important.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:41.160]   Basically what it showed is that when people hyperventilate,
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.280]   they expel, that is they exhale more carbon dioxide
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.300]   than they would normally.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:50.080]   So they become what's called hypocapnic, okay?
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.920]   Carbon dioxide levels are low in the blood
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.640]   and over a short period of time,
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.960]   they become low in the tissues of the body.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.360]   When that carbon dioxide level drops low, you would say,
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.960]   okay, well, you're still bringing in a lot of oxygen
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.160]   because these people are hyperventilating,
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.760]   so they should feel really alert.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.160]   And indeed that's what happens, the people feel very alert.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.640]   However, because they're not bringing enough
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.360]   carbon dioxide in, or rather the proper way to say it would
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.560]   be because they're over-breathing, exhaling too much,
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.080]   they are not retaining or keeping in enough carbon dioxide.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.320]   Well, then that lack of carbon dioxide means that the oxygen
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.360]   that they are breathing in can't be liberated
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.880]   from the hemoglobin, can't get to the brain.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.280]   And what they observe is about a 30 to 40% reduction
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.320]   in the amount of oxygen that's being delivered to the brain.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:50.040]   And the reduction in carbon dioxide also prevents
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.600]   some of the normal patterns of vasodilation,
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.220]   the dilating, the opening up of the capillaries.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:00.000]   So again, less blood flow, but most importantly,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.960]   as it's shown in this paper,
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.560]   the brain overall becomes hyperexcitable.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.680]   It's as if it's being starved of oxygen and blood flow
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.980]   and all the neurons in a very nonspecific way
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.660]   start increasing their firing level.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.020]   So the background activity is getting louder and louder.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.980]   It's like the rumbler, the noise of a crowd at a stadium.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:23.980]   And as a consequence, the sensory input from a sound
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.240]   or from a touch or from some other event in the world
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.820]   doesn't get above the noise.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.800]   What this means is that when we hyperventilate,
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.220]   because we aren't retaining enough carbon dioxide,
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.900]   we are not getting enough oxygen
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.520]   to the tissues that need oxygen.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.220]   And as a consequence of that,
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.000]   the brain becomes hyperexcitable.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.040]   We actually know that there's an increase in anxiety
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.960]   and we become less good, less efficient
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.520]   at detecting things in our environment.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.360]   So we're not processing information as well at all.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.980]   The noise goes up and the signal goes down.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.280]   Again, incredibly important set of findings.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.160]   I should also mention that hyperventilation is one way
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.960]   that in the laboratory anyway,
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.660]   or in neurosurgery units for some time physicians
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.060]   would evoke seizure in seizure prone patients.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.380]   The reason that works is exactly the explanation
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.520]   I just gave you.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.620]   Seizure is a hyperexcitability of the brain,
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.420]   not enough inhibition or suppression
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.500]   of the overall circuitry.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.140]   So you get these waves or these storms
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.020]   of electrical activity.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.800]   Low levels of carbon dioxide in the brain
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.620]   because of low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.920]   are one of the major triggers for seizures.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.740]   Now, I realize that most people listening to this
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.580]   are not epileptic, but nonetheless,
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.500]   this brings us all back to this question
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.180]   of what is normal healthy breathing?
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.920]   As I mentioned before, normal healthy breathing
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.080]   is breathing about six liters of air per minute.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.420]   But of course, most of us don't think
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.580]   in terms of liters of air
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.300]   and we're not going to go measure our lung capacity.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.340]   At least most of us aren't going to do that.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.600]   Basically, if you are taking relatively shallow breaths
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.480]   and you're just sitting there working
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.180]   or maybe even walking slowly,
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.780]   again, not talking or engaging in any kind of speech
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   or eating, chances are six liters of air per minute
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.960]   is about 12 shallow-ish breaths.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.240]   And when I say shallow, I don't mean breathing
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.780]   like a little bunny rabbit or something like that.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:22.940]   I just mean casually breathing in, out, in, out.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:26.780]   The studies that have explored the breathing patterns
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.360]   in large populations of individuals
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.040]   who are not suffering necessarily
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.300]   from any one specific ailment
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:39.920]   have shown that most people breathe far too much per minute,
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.020]   that they're engaging in anywhere from 15 to 20
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:45.380]   or even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.200]   So they are vastly over-breathing
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.220]   relative to how they should be breathing.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.380]   Now, of course, if you breathe more deeply,
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.040]   so you take a vigorous inhale,
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:58.140]   and then you expel that air,
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.260]   well, then to get six liters of air
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.060]   into your system per minute,
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.940]   you're probably only going to need
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:08.520]   somewhere between four and six breaths
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.020]   in order to get that six liters per minute.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:14.780]   Now, the total time that it takes to do that inhale and exhale
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.880]   isn't that much longer than a kind of shallow breath,
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.780]   provided you're not deliberately breathing quickly
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.340]   during those shallow breaths.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:22.700]   So then you say, well,
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.020]   how is it that normal healthy breathing
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.920]   that delivers the appropriate amount of carbon dioxide
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.420]   into the system and doesn't expel,
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.700]   doesn't exhale too much carbon dioxide,
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.500]   how are we supposed to do that normal breathing, right?
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.780]   Are you supposed to breathe four times
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.420]   and then hold your breath until the minute passes?
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:41.340]   No, what you find is that the correct pattern of breathing
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.580]   is going to involve two things.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.860]   First of all, nasal breathing,
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.940]   because of the resistance it provides through the nose
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:46.900]   that we talked about earlier,
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.300]   is going to deliver more oxygen into your system.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.420]   You're going to be able to generate more air pressure
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.900]   to fill your lungs.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:57.900]   That greater air pressure is going to take longer to exhale.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.640]   So already we're increasing the amount of time
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.300]   that each breath is going to take.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.100]   And also what you find is that people that are breathing
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.500]   in the proper healthy manner,
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.860]   that is that are balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:09.320]   in the proper ways,
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.540]   are also taking pauses between breaths.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.660]   This is extremely important
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.260]   because even though we have a brain center,
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.340]   the pre-Botzinger complex that can control,
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.360]   or I should say does control inhale, exhale,
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.660]   rhythmic breathing,
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.500]   those pauses between breaths are not always present.
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.460]   In fact, often are not present
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.340]   from people's baseline breathing patterns
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.780]   and as a consequence, they over-breathe.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.160]   And as I told you before, when people over-breathe,
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.940]   their brain becomes hyperexcitable
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.500]   at the level of the background noise,
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.840]   and yet they are less efficient
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.300]   at detecting and learning information.
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.540]   And we'll get into the specific studies
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.080]   that really illustrate the learning aspect a bit later,
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.340]   but they are less efficient
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.140]   at detecting and learning information,
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.000]   at focusing and so on,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.900]   as a consequence of this over-breathing
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.180]   and the hyperexcitability that causes.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.340]   Now, of course, that's also just emphasizing
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.060]   the effects of over-breathing
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.260]   and lack of carbon dioxide on the brain.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:07.500]   There are hundreds, if not thousands of studies
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.700]   showing that when we don't have enough carbon dioxide
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.880]   in the tissues of our body,
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.900]   that's also problematic for all the tissues,
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.620]   the liver, the lungs themselves, the stomach, et cetera,
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.800]   that relate largely to shifts in pH
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.500]   because of the fact that carbon dioxide
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.760]   strongly regulates the acidity, alkalinity of the blood
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.060]   and the tissues that that blood supplies nutrients to,
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.580]   including carbon dioxide.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.020]   So the basic takeaway here is
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.680]   you want to breathe in a healthy manner at rest.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.100]   And the best way to do that is to spend some time,
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:42.200]   and it doesn't take much, maybe a minute or so each day,
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.560]   paying attention to how quickly you are breathing per minute
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.980]   when you are simply at rest,
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.780]   when you're making coffee in the morning,
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.180]   when you're sitting down to read,
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.600]   when you're on social media.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.420]   Chronically holding your breath isn't good,
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.100]   but neither is over-breathing.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.800]   And again, every study that has examined
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.440]   the typical patterns of breathing
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.980]   and patterns of breathing that show up as normal
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.360]   and abnormal has found that more often than not,
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.420]   during the nighttime, people are under-breathing,
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.880]   and in the daytime, they are over-breathing,
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.400]   they're hyperventilating.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.960]   I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.800]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.080]   which is InsideTracker.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.760]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.340]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.900]   to help you better understand your body
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:27.760]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.060]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.040]   for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.380]   that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.500]   lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.240]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.360]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.960]   is that most of the time it does not come back
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.560]   with any information about what to do
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.820]   in order to move the values for hormones,
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.680]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.120]   into the ranges that you want.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.620]   With InsideTracker, changing those values
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.780]   becomes very straightforward
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:58.720]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.740]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:04.480]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.620]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.660]   that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.380]   InsideTracker now includes a measurement
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:15.040]   of apolipoprotein B, so-called apoB in their ultimate plan.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.700]   ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.460]   and therefore there's extreme value
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.460]   to knowing your apoB levels.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.840]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.560]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.880]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.040]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.860]   So next I'd like to address what you can do
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.280]   about your normal patterns of breathing.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.840]   That is how you or anyone can adjust their normal patterns
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.800]   of breathing from an unhealthy to an unhealthy state.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.060]   But the first thing we have to do, of course,
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.240]   is determine whether or not you're already breathing
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.700]   in an unhealthy or in a healthy way.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.200]   And again, when I say healthy or unhealthy,
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.280]   I mean, are you over-breathing?
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.200]   Are you under-breathing?
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.880]   Are you delivering the appropriate ratios
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.560]   of oxygen and carbon dioxide
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.760]   to the tissues of your brain and body?
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.560]   In order to do this, we're going to do a simple test.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.880]   Again, please don't do this while driving
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.280]   or operating heavy machinery or near water of any kind,
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.280]   but assuming that you're not doing any of those things,
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.600]   I encourage you to sit down,
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.000]   certainly not lie down, but just sit down.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.280]   I suppose you also could do it standing,
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.980]   and we are going to do what's called
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.480]   the carbon dioxide tolerance test.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.820]   The carbon dioxide tolerance test
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:24.200]   is a sort of back of the envelope measure
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.240]   of how well you are managing carbon dioxide.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:30.140]   That is how well you can control your breathing
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.480]   at both the mechanical and the chemical level.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.800]   It's a very simple test.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.800]   What you're going to do is for the next 10 seconds or so
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.640]   while I'm speaking, you're just going to breathe normally.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.060]   Now, again and again, throughout this episode,
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:46.000]   I'm going to encourage you to be a nasal breather
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.280]   whenever possible.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.440]   But of course, there are instances
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.880]   in which you want to engage mouth breathing.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.280]   But for the time being, as I continue to blab on
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.520]   for the next few seconds, just inhale through your nose,
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.580]   exhale through your nose.
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.560]   You don't have to deliberately slow your breathing
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.880]   or increase the cadence of your breathing.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.040]   However, in that time, you're also going to want to find
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.100]   some sort of time measuring device,
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.980]   like it could be your phone or it could be a stopwatch.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.280]   What I'm going to ask you to do in a few minutes
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.880]   is I'm going to ask you to inhale through your nose
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.880]   as deeply as you possibly can.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.400]   That is, you're going to fill your lungs
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.720]   as much as you can through your nose.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.720]   And then start a timer and measure how long it takes
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.400]   for you to deliberately control that exhale
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.920]   until your lungs are empty.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.240]   Okay, so this is going to be a controlled exhale
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.800]   through the nose after a big, deep breath.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.320]   But for the time being, keep breathing
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.760]   at a kind of calm, regular cadence.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.160]   Okay, so you can find that time measuring device now,
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.200]   or you can come back to it later if you like.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.120]   When I say inhale, you're going to inhale
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.240]   as deeply as you can through your nose,
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.780]   remembering that the diaphragm can really help you here
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.880]   to get a deep inhale by having your belly
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.980]   move out while you inhale.
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.920]   And then when I say start,
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.080]   you're going to measure the time that it takes
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.680]   to do a complete lungs empty exhale.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.040]   In fact, I'll measure it for you.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.980]   This will be one of the rare instances in this podcast
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.120]   where there's going to be a long period of silence
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120]   as I measure something.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.240]   So I've got a stopwatch here.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.080]   So please prepare to do the big inhale
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   and start inhaling now.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.560]   So inhale as deeply as you can through your nose,
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.480]   fill your lungs as much as you can.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:34.400]   Okay, now start, meaning slowly control the exhale
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.480]   through your nose.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.560]   You're trying to let that air out as slowly as possible.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.040]   And I'm just going to call out every 10 or 15 seconds or so.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.920]   And you want to note when your lungs are empty.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.120]   I know you can hold your breath with your lungs empty.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.880]   That is not an accurate measure, 15 seconds.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.400]   It is important that you know when your lungs are empty
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.300]   and that you're trying to control the exhale
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.480]   as much as possible so that you don't arrive
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.960]   at that lungs empty time too quickly.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:06.360]   I'll explain what too quickly means, 30 seconds.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.160]   Okay, for those of you that have already
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.120]   reached lungs empty, please go back to breathing normally.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.460]   For those of you that haven't,
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:18.600]   can hang in here a little longer.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.620]   If you're still discarding that air, 45 seconds.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.800]   And we're rounding toward a minute, not quite there.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.600]   Some of you are probably still letting out that air.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.520]   I want to point out none of this has to do
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.320]   with cardiovascular fitness level,
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.260]   at least not in any kind of direct way.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.620]   And 60 seconds.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.180]   And I realized there will be a small subset of you out there
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.560]   that are still expelling your air in a slow lungs,
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.800]   slow exhale manner through the nose.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.180]   Okay, so what we just did is a back of the envelope
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:51.480]   carbon dioxide discard rate, okay?
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.360]   If you need to pause this and go back and try it again,
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.880]   you just want to time how long it takes you
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.000]   to go from lungs full to lungs empty.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.560]   Again, with the full understanding,
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.400]   I know that you can all sit there like beasts
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.160]   and hold your breath with your lungs empty,
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.120]   but please don't do that,
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.000]   because that's not going to be informative
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.520]   for what I'm telling you now.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.360]   What I'm going to tell you now
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.400]   is that if it took you 20 seconds or less
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.520]   to expel all your air,
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.400]   that is you couldn't extend that exhale
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.840]   longer than 20 seconds,
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.640]   in a kind of back of the envelope way,
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.400]   we can say that you have a relatively brief
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.040]   or low carbon dioxide tolerance, okay?
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.160]   If it took you somewhere between 25 and 40,
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.120]   maybe 45 seconds to expel all your air,
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.000]   that is you could control that exhale
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.040]   for about 45 seconds or 30 seconds,
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.640]   then you have a moderate level of carbon dioxide tolerance.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.680]   And if, for instance, you were able to go 50 seconds
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.080]   or longer for that discard until you hit lungs empty,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.040]   you have a fairly high degree of carbon dioxide tolerance.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.120]   Now, here's the deal.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.840]   If you had low carbon dioxide tolerance,
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.520]   that is your 20 seconds or less,
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.000]   you're going to write down the number three, okay?
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.840]   If you had moderate levels of carbon dioxide tolerance,
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.860]   you're going to write down the number five,
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.340]   or you could even put five to six.
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.440]   And then if you are in that bracket of people
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.620]   that was able to discard your air
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.880]   over a period of 50 seconds or more,
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.480]   you're going to write down the number eight to 10, okay?
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.600]   Now, what are these numbers?
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.480]   What are we talking about?
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.440]   And before we get into what to do with these numbers,
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.980]   I want to emphasize again,
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.840]   this does not have to do with fitness level per se.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.280]   I know some world-class triathletes
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.400]   that have very fast carbon dioxide blow off times,
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.800]   that is their discard rates are 20 seconds or less.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.940]   I should also point out that if you're very stressed,
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:44.800]   that number is going to be very small.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.860]   If you're very relaxed,
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.300]   like you just woke up after a long night of sleep
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.700]   and you feel great, that number is going to be extended, okay?
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.600]   So this is a back of the envelope measure
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.560]   that you're going to use each time
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.980]   you decide to do the exercise
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.340]   I'm going to tell you about in a moment.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.580]   And the exercise I'm going to tell you about in a moment
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.700]   can be done every day if you like,
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:05.060]   but what the most interesting studies, at least to me,
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.140]   indicate is that you could do the exercise
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.640]   I'll tell you about even just once or twice a week
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.260]   and greatly improve your efficiency of breathing
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:16.040]   and shift yourself away from over-breathing when at rest,
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.020]   even if you're not thinking
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.660]   about how you're breathing at rest.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.140]   Okay, so what is this exercise?
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.740]   Well, you just got your number,
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.260]   either low, medium or high bracket number
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.980]   for carbon dioxide discard rate.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.540]   Remember if you're in the low category, your number is three.
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.280]   If you're medium, it's five to six.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.700]   And if you are in the long carbon dioxide discard rate,
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.280]   long duration carbon dioxide discard rate,
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.580]   that is eight to 10 is your number.
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:41.100]   Now you're going to do two minutes
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.420]   of what most people would call box breathing.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.440]   What is box breathing?
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.260]   Box breathing are equal duration,
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.200]   inhale, hold, exhale, hold, repeat.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.180]   So inhale, hold, exhale, hold.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.540]   Sounds very easy, right?
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:59.540]   How long do you inhale and then hold, exhale and then hold?
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.020]   Well, you now know if you were in the low group
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.420]   of carbon dioxide discard rate,
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:05.820]   your inhale is going to be three seconds,
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.420]   your hold will be three seconds,
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.240]   your exhale will be three seconds,
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.020]   and then you repeat, three seconds.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.040]   So each sides of the box, if you will,
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.220]   is going to be three seconds long.
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.760]   If you were in the moderate carbon dioxide
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.020]   discard rate category, then you're going to inhale
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:22.580]   for five to six seconds, hold for five to six,
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.880]   exhale for five to six, hold for five to six,
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.280]   repeat for about two minutes.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.900]   You could do three minutes if you want,
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.240]   but I think it's important to have protocols
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.960]   that are feasible for most people.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.520]   And that's going to mean doing things
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:36.120]   for about two to five minutes when it comes
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.580]   to these breath rehabilitation exercises
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.280]   for restoring normal breathing.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.420]   And then of course, if you were in the long category
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.520]   of carbon dioxide discard rate,
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:48.760]   you should be able to do an eight to 10 second inhale,
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.160]   eight to 10 second hold, eight to 10 second exhale,
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.020]   eight to 10 second hold and repeat, okay?
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.840]   So you could do that exercise now if you like,
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.280]   or you could do it at some point offline.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.820]   You can pause this podcast if you want and go try it.
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:05.720]   That's an exercise that you can do
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.600]   for about two to three minutes, once or twice per week.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.480]   What's happening when you do that exercise?
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.880]   Well, first of all, you are greatly increasing
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.200]   your neural mechanical control over the diaphragm.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.240]   This is very important.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.720]   Most people are not aware of this phrenic nerve pathway
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.740]   in the diaphragm and you're greatly increasing
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.720]   your mechanical control over this pathway
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.080]   through the process we call neuroplasticity.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.360]   When you deliberately focus on a aspect
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.620]   of your nervous system control,
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:36.100]   in particular nervous system control over musculature
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:37.620]   that normally is subconscious
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:38.700]   and you're not paying attention to,
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.000]   and when you actively take control of that,
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.240]   it requires that your brain adjust and rewire
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.000]   the relationship between the different components
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:47.840]   of that circuit.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.400]   And the wonderful thing is that has been shown
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.800]   to lead to changes in your resting pattern of breathing.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.000]   Now, why did we go through the whole business
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.020]   of doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test?
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:00.640]   Well, for people who don't tolerate carbon dioxide very well,
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.180]   they don't have very good phrenic,
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:06.000]   that is neuro-mechanical control of the diaphragm
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:06.840]   for whatever reason.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.480]   Again, it doesn't mean you're not fit.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.580]   It just means you don't have or you have not yet developed
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.640]   neuro-mechanical control of the diaphragm.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.840]   It would be near impossible for you to do box breathing
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.040]   for two or three minutes with eight seconds in,
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.760]   eight seconds hold, eight seconds exhale, eight second hold.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.480]   So that's why we do a test
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.440]   to see what you're capable of doing.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.160]   You don't want the box breathing to be too strained
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.160]   where you're really challenged to get around the whole box.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.560]   You want it to be relatively easy
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.780]   because remember you're trying to translate this pattern
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.160]   to your normal pattern of breathing.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.360]   That is your pattern of breathing
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.560]   when you're not consciously thinking about breathing.
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.620]   And what are we really translating
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.680]   when we do this box breathing type exercise?
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.440]   What you're translating is the ability
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.240]   to pause between breaths
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:56.240]   and yet take full mechanically driven breaths
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.040]   that involve the phrenic nerve and diaphragm.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.840]   So again, you're encouraging,
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.280]   especially if you use nasal breathing
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.700]   when you do the box breathing,
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:06.040]   you're encouraging phrenic control over the diaphragm
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.960]   and you're getting that six liters of air per minute or so
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.640]   using fewer and fewer breaths over time.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.640]   So this is a, again, zero cost,
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.960]   although it does cost a little bit of time,
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.200]   zero cost approach to adjusting
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.300]   your normal pattern of breathing at rest,
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:23.600]   which has a huge number of positive outcomes
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:27.040]   in terms of your ability to stay relatively calm,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.680]   to not get the hyperexcitability of the brain.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.240]   It has actually been shown in various studies,
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.220]   and we'll talk about one in particular later,
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:38.240]   to greatly improve not just levels of calm
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.900]   and reduce bouts of stress,
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.740]   but also improve nighttime sleep.
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.040]   There are a huge number of benefits
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.120]   that can come from doing this box breathing exercise,
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.480]   but you got to get the duration of the sides of the box right
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.280]   and that's why you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.680]   One thing that many people notice
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.680]   after doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test,
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.680]   even just once,
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.820]   and then doing this box breathing exercise
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.240]   once or twice a week,
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.640]   is that after two or three weeks,
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.440]   the box breathing itself becomes very easy.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.360]   And in that case,
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.760]   I recommend taking the carbon dioxide tolerance test
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:08.680]   over again,
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.940]   and almost always what you'll find
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.380]   is that you have been able to extend
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:15.400]   your carbon dioxide discard rate,
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:19.520]   and therefore you now fall into a different category,
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.360]   not just the lower medium,
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.960]   but the long carbon dioxide discard rate category,
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.600]   and you are able to extend the duration
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.080]   of those inhale hold exhale holds during the box breathing.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:31.920]   And of course,
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.680]   the ultimate benefit of all this is that it translates
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.480]   to deeper and yet less frequent breathing when at rest
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.440]   and when not consciously paying attention
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.280]   to how you're breathing during the daytime.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.580]   Again, if at all possible,
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:48.200]   do all of this breathing through the nose.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.080]   For those of you that have a severely occluded nose,
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.560]   the recommendation always is to breathe
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.640]   through your nose more,
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.840]   but I do realize that for some people,
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.720]   it's really uncomfortable to breathe through the nose
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.060]   because they have such an occluded nasal pathway.
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:01.760]   And for you folks,
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.400]   doing some of this breathing through the mouth
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.560]   can probably suffice,
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.960]   but if at all possible,
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.560]   do the breathing through the nose.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:11.840]   And please also let me know how your progress
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.240]   evolves over time with the carbon dioxide discard rate
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.520]   and the box breathing.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.640]   And of course the positive shifts that occur
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.300]   in normal unconscious daytime breathing
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:23.920]   translate to all the opposite things that we talked about
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.920]   when you are over-breathing during the daytime.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.040]   So what I just described
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.480]   in terms of the carbon dioxide tolerance test
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.360]   and the exercise using box breathing
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.300]   to restore normal patterns of breathing and not over-breathe
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:40.000]   and therefore not eliminate too much carbon dioxide
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.960]   is exactly the two tests that were incorporated into a study
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.880]   that my laboratory did in collaboration
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.000]   with our associate chair of psychiatry
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.120]   at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel,
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.940]   who's also been a guest on this podcast previously.
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:56.420]   And that study explored box breathing,
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:58.700]   but it also explored other forms of breathing
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.240]   and actually compare those forms of deliberate breathing
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.840]   to meditation as a means to explore
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:08.580]   what are going to be the minimal effective doses
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:12.780]   and most effective ways to chronically reduce stress
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:16.800]   around the clock and improve mood and improve sleep.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.960]   So the study I'm referring to was just published recently.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:23.120]   It's entitled Brief Structured Respiration Practices,
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.960]   Enhance Mood and Reduce Physiological Arousal.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.560]   We will also provide a link to this paper
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.140]   in the show note captions.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.400]   What this study really focused on was a simple question,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.420]   which is what is the shortest and most effective practice
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:37.840]   that people can use
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.720]   in order to reduce their levels of stress,
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.240]   not just during that breath work practice
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.600]   or meditation practice, but around the clock,
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.880]   24 hours a day, including improvements in sleep.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.440]   And we were excited to do this study
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:53.540]   because many studies had explored how meditation,
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:56.280]   or in some cases, fewer studies,
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.560]   had explored how breath work can impact
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.520]   different brain states or bodily states.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.000]   But very few studies had explored
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.720]   how those breath work or meditation practices
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.820]   influenced body brain states around the clock
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:11.840]   when people were not performing the particular meditation
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.400]   or breath work practice.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.320]   The reason we were able to do this study
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.820]   was really fortunate.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:18.480]   The folks over at WHOOP were generous enough
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.260]   to donate a bunch of WHOOP straps,
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.740]   which allowed us to measure heart rate variability,
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:26.180]   a number of other different physiological parameters.
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:27.960]   We also got subjective reports
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.820]   about people's mood and feelings of wellbeing.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.800]   We got data about their sleep
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.760]   pinged to us from remote locations.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:35.580]   So these people,
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.140]   rather than being brought to the laboratory
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:41.120]   and being in a very artificial circumstance, the laboratory,
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.720]   as much as we like to think our laboratory is realistic,
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.240]   we have virtual reality and things like that,
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.200]   there's nothing as realistic as the real world.
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.440]   And so we were able to have more than a hundred subjects
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.940]   out in the real world, living their real lives,
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:55.360]   pinging back to us data all the time, 24 hours a day,
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.720]   so that we could measure
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.080]   how their different interventions that we asked them to do,
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.940]   breath work practices or meditation practices,
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:04.160]   were impacting physiological parameters.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.200]   And they were also informing us regularly
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.200]   about their subjective mood, et cetera.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:11.480]   We got a lot of data, as you can imagine.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.880]   And the basic takeaway from the study was twofold.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.960]   First of all, we discovered that deliberate breath work
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   practices done for about five minutes per day
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.780]   across the course of about a month,
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:28.200]   led to greater reductions in stress
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.280]   than did a five minute a day meditation practice.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.880]   Now, that is not to say that meditation is not useful.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.320]   In fact, there are dozens, if not hundreds of papers,
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.980]   including one particular, I should say,
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:42.680]   particularly beautiful study from Wendy Suzuki's lab
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.080]   at New York University showing that a daily 10 to 13 minute
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:51.260]   mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.780]   memory, and a number of other things
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.720]   related to cognition and learning.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.480]   However, the research on meditation has shown us
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.860]   that meditation, at least short meditations,
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:03.680]   mainly lead to improvements in focus and memory,
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.440]   not so much reductions in stress,
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.020]   although they do lead to reductions in stress.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:10.720]   What we found was that any number
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.000]   of different breath work practices,
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.240]   and we explored three, done for five minutes a day,
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.400]   outperformed meditation in terms of the ability
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:22.160]   of breath work to reduce stress around the clock
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.840]   compared to meditation.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.080]   The three types of breath work that we explored
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.400]   also showed different effects.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.040]   I should mention the three types of breath work
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.840]   that we compared were box breathing
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.860]   of the sort that you just learned about.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:38.680]   We compared that to something called cyclic sighing,
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.300]   which involves two inhales through the nose
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:45.640]   to get maximally inflated lungs, followed by a long exhale.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.440]   I'll return to that in a moment.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.360]   That was repeated for five minutes at a time
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.600]   for each session.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.180]   And a third breath work practice,
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.780]   which was cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:55.200]   which as the name suggests,
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.500]   involves people inhaling deeply through the nose,
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.380]   then exhaling passively through the mouth,
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:02.060]   and then repeating inhale through the nose,
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:04.840]   exhale through the mouth, repeating that for 25 cycles,
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.240]   one cycle being an inhale and an exhale.
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.280]   So that equals one cycle.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.880]   Repeating that for 25 cycles,
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.220]   then exhaling all their air and holding their breath
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:14.360]   with lungs empty for about 15 to 30 seconds,
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.720]   and then repeating inhale, exhale,
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.080]   cyclic hyperventilation for the duration of five minutes.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.000]   Okay, so people were divided into these different groups,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.200]   either mindfulness meditation, where they sat,
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.720]   they were not told to control their breathing
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.600]   in any specific way.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.160]   They closed their eyes, they focused their attention
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.440]   on a region just behind their forehead.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.280]   One group did that.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.460]   The other group did cyclic sighing.
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:37.280]   Another group did box breathing.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.720]   Another group did cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.720]   As any sort of clinical trial like this ought to,
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.840]   we then swapped people into different groups
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.560]   so they served as their own control,
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.780]   so we could evaluate any kind of between
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:52.720]   and within individual variability.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.300]   Again, there are a lot of data in this paper,
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:59.720]   but the takeaway was that for the sake of stress reduction
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.200]   around the clock, and for the sake of improving sleep
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:06.720]   and mood, the most effective practice of the four practices
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.760]   that we examined was the cyclic sighing.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.280]   Again, cyclic sighing is performed the following way.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.200]   You inhale through the nose as deeply as you can,
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.060]   then you do a second inhale immediately afterwards
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.440]   to try and maximally inflate the lungs.
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:19.680]   In fact, that's what happens.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.200]   We know that during that second inhale,
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.720]   even if it's just a very sharp, short inhale,
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.800]   the extra physical vigor that's required
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.560]   to generate that second inhale
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.760]   causes those aviolae of the lungs,
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.860]   which may have collapsed, and indeed in between breaths,
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.980]   and often even just through the course of the day,
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:41.880]   and especially if we get stressed,
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.520]   those aviolae of the lungs start to collapse,
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.760]   and because they're damp on the inside,
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.060]   they have a little bit of fluid,
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.880]   they're like a balloon with a little bit of fluid
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.200]   in the middle, it takes a little bit of physical force
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.280]   to pop those open.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.860]   Now, you're not literally exploding them pop,
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.500]   but you're reinflating them with air,
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:03.000]   and then you perform the long exhale through the mouth
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.880]   until lungs are empty, so it looks exactly like this.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:17.800]   Now, we know that one single physiological sigh
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.080]   of the sort that I just described
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.780]   performed at any time of day under any conditions,
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:25.760]   whether or not you're about to walk on stage to give a talk,
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.080]   or you're in a meeting and you're feeling stressed,
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.520]   or you're in a conversation that's very stressful,
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.720]   or you can feel stress mounting because you're in traffic,
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:35.920]   or any number of psychological or physical stressors
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.880]   that may be approaching you or you feel are oppressing you,
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.880]   doing one physiological sigh
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.920]   of the sort that I just described
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.080]   is the fastest physiologically verified way
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:52.440]   that we are aware of to reduce your levels of stress
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.240]   and to reintroduce calm,
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.700]   that is to shift your autonomic nervous system
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:00.200]   from a state of heightened levels of autonomic arousal
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.400]   that is sympathetic nervous system, as it's called,
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.320]   is at a higher activation level
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.400]   than the so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.720]   Again, sympathetic nervous system,
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.800]   having nothing to do with sympathy,
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.500]   has everything to do with so-called fight or flight,
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:12.680]   although it controls other things too,
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.120]   including positive arousal.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.940]   And the parasympathetic nervous system,
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:17.840]   often referred to as the rest and digest system,
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.380]   although it does other things too,
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:21.440]   is associated with calming.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.240]   Those two things are always in kind of push-pull
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.480]   with one another, like a seesaw or push-pull,
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.840]   however you want to think about it.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:30.040]   One physiological sigh, meaning that big, deep inhale,
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.940]   short second inhale, also through the nose,
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:35.140]   and then long exhale to completely lungs empty,
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:37.680]   is known to restore the level of balance
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.900]   in the sympathetic, parasympathetic neural circuitries,
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.960]   and is the fastest way to reintroduce calm.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.640]   That's one physiological sigh.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.960]   In this study, what we asked
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.180]   was that people perform that repeatedly,
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:54.320]   so-called cyclic sighing, for the duration of five minutes.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.560]   And the people who did that cyclic sighing
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.080]   for five minutes a day,
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.280]   regardless of the time of day that they did it,
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.840]   experienced the greatest reductions in stress,
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:06.740]   not just during the practice, but around the 24-hour cycle,
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.980]   and it translated, again,
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.820]   to all sorts of positive subjective changes,
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.720]   improvements in sleep.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.560]   Lower resting heart rate at all times of day,
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.400]   so this is important.
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.000]   Again, this study was not just exploring
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.180]   what happens during meditation or breath work,
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.760]   cyclic sighing, et cetera,
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.200]   it was exploring how the changes that occur
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.680]   during that practice translate to changes in breathing
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.500]   and heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout the 24-hour cycle
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.160]   so the takeaway here is twofold.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.560]   First of all, if you're somebody
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.360]   who wants to improve your mood
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:38.360]   and reduce your overall levels of stress,
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:41.880]   and you only have five minutes a day to invest in that,
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.160]   hopefully you're doing all the other things
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.080]   like trying to get proper sleep and exercise,
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.680]   social connection, nutrition, et cetera,
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:50.120]   sunlight in the morning, of course, can't leave that out,
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.760]   but if you were going to devote five minutes a day
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.280]   to a stress reduction practice that is now supported by data
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:59.820]   to translate to reductions in stress around the clock,
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:03.080]   the data say that you would want to invest that
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.440]   in cyclic sighing, that is double inhale through the nose,
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:07.920]   extended exhale through the mouth
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:08.820]   until your lungs are empty,
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.660]   then repeat for five minutes a day.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.400]   You, of course, if you like, could do meditation.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.760]   It still had positive effects, meaning it reduced stress,
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.480]   although not as much as cyclic sighing.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.860]   You could do box breathing if you want
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:21.660]   for the purpose of reducing stress.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:24.560]   All the practices we explored did reduce stress,
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.860]   but cyclic sighing performed for five minutes a day
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:29.360]   had the most robust and pervasive effect
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.240]   in reducing stress, improving mood, and improving sleep.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.640]   That's the first message of the study.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.800]   The second takeaway is that one physiological sigh,
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.240]   that's right, just one physiological sigh,
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.720]   where you inhale deeply through the nose,
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:42.820]   another inhale through the nose
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:44.880]   to maximally inflate the oviolae of the lungs,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:49.040]   and then you exhale to completely lungs empty
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.880]   and then go back to normal breathing,
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:54.640]   is the fastest way to introduce a level of calm
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.800]   and to reduce your overall levels of stress in real time.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.880]   And this is very important.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.640]   I think that out there these days,
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.520]   we hear a lot about stress reduction techniques,
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:05.360]   and most all of the stress reduction techniques
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:06.320]   that have been explored,
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:09.420]   everything from massage to meditation to breath work
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:13.080]   to a hot shower to a foot rub will calm you down.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.640]   The question is, do they calm you down
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.560]   just during that practice?
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.400]   Great if it does,
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.620]   but does it also translate to reduce levels of stress
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.540]   at other times in the 24 hour cycle
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.220]   and other positive effects as well?
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:28.280]   So one physiological sigh is a very efficient way
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.800]   to adjust that ratio of sympathetic
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.220]   to parasympathetic activation
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.640]   and immediately bring about calm.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.420]   So it's excellent for real time control of stress.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.880]   The other thing about physiological sighs
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:39.920]   is that it's not a hack.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.320]   It's not the application of a breathing practice
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.080]   to something that it wasn't intended for.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.680]   In fact, physiological sighs
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.200]   were not discovered by me at all.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.360]   They were discovered by physiologists in the 1930s
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.720]   who found that when people underbreathe,
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.240]   they have a buildup of carbon dioxide in their system.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.840]   And even though carbon dioxide is essential for life,
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.560]   you don't want too much of it in your system.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:05.280]   And that people, whether or not they were asleep or awake,
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.640]   would engage a physiological sigh
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.720]   spontaneously, subconsciously.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.400]   They would do this double inhale through the nose
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.600]   and extended exhale through the mouth.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:17.200]   And that did not just eliminate excessive carbon dioxide
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.100]   from the system.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:21.380]   It also rebalanced the oxygen carbon dioxide ratio
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:22.280]   in the proper ways.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:23.920]   In fact, it's observed in animals.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.120]   You might see this in animals that are tired.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.760]   When animals or humans get tired,
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.100]   they tend to start underbreathing a little bit.
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:32.040]   And that can often disrupt the balance
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.320]   of carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:35.540]   And right before a dog will go down for a nap, for instance,
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.220]   you'll notice that it'll do this double inhale exhale.
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.640]   People, when they are sleeping,
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.740]   if they hold their breath for a period of time,
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.800]   which frankly all of us do periodically throughout sleep,
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.140]   they will engage a spontaneous physiological sigh.
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:51.380]   During the daytime, we are often holding our breath,
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.240]   especially nowadays.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.860]   And there's a study on this
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.220]   that we'll talk about a little bit later
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:57.280]   where when people text message or they're emailing,
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.340]   although nowadays people are mainly on social media
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.380]   and text messaging, they often are holding their breath.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:04.420]   They will follow a breath hold by a physiological sigh
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.760]   because during that breath hold,
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.580]   they're building up the level of carbon dioxide
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:08.420]   in their system.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:10.740]   Now, mind you, I spent close to a half an hour telling you
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:13.100]   that most people are over-breathing at rest.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:14.680]   And that's also true.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.500]   But people often will shift from over-breathing
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:20.740]   to under-breathing, which is a terrible pattern.
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:24.660]   So physiological sigh is done either as a one-off,
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.980]   one physiological sigh to clamp stress
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:28.340]   or reduce stress in real time,
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.880]   or repeatedly over five minutes as a practice
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.380]   that you do each day is going to be
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.460]   not just the most effective way to approach
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.720]   reducing stress around the clock and in real time,
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.420]   but also the one that's highly compatible
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.620]   with the way that the neural circuits
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:44.360]   that control breathing were designed.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.940]   The physiological sigh has some other
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.060]   very useful applications.
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:50.740]   One of the more, I would say useful ones,
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.900]   at least to those of you that exercise
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:55.500]   is going to be the use of physiological sigh
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.900]   in order to remove the so-called side stitch.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:01.140]   So if you've ever been running or swimming or exercising,
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:03.660]   you felt a cramp on your right side,
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:07.020]   chances are, despite what your high school PE coach told you
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.980]   that raising your arms above your head
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:11.340]   or drinking less water before you exercise
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.880]   is not going to get rid of that cramp.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:17.220]   And here's why, it's not a cramp at all.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:21.660]   If you recall the cervical three, four, and five nerves
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.660]   that give rise to the phrenic nerve
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:26.380]   and go down and innervate your diaphragm,
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.180]   well, as I mentioned before,
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:29.820]   a certain number of those nerve fibers
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:32.940]   actually course into the diaphragm and go up underneath.
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.420]   And if you recall earlier,
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.380]   I also said that the diaphragm sits right
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:37.940]   on top of the liver.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:41.020]   In other words, you actually have a sensory innervation
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:43.460]   of the diaphragm, the deep diaphragm,
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:44.680]   and the liver.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:47.260]   And there's something called a referenced pain,
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:49.960]   which is what people generally experience
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.540]   when they have that side stitch on their right-hand side.
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:55.060]   So if you're ever exercising and you feel a cramp
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.100]   on your right-hand side,
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.420]   it's possible that it's a genuine cramp,
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:01.900]   but more likely is the fact
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:04.480]   that that phrenic nerve sensory innervation
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.160]   is now being carried up to your brain
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.320]   and you are detecting some local or referenced pain
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.340]   in the liver and in the diaphragm.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.580]   Now that doesn't necessarily mean
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.660]   you're doing anything wrong,
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:19.320]   although you might not be breathing properly
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.700]   for running at that moment.
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:21.720]   And that's what gave rise to it.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:24.380]   It could be some spasming of the phrenic nerve
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.420]   or some inefficient breathing during running.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:29.420]   We had an entire series on fitness with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.040]   One of those episodes included
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.400]   a lot of information on breathing.
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.900]   It was the episode on endurance,
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.200]   although breathing was a topic that was thread
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.920]   through multiple episodes in that series.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.940]   You can find that series at hubermanlab.com.
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.780]   Talks a lot about how to breathe during running,
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:44.780]   how to breathe during weightlifting, et cetera.
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.820]   But the point for now is that
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:50.300]   if ever you're experiencing that right side side stitch,
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.940]   I encourage you to perform the physiological sigh.
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:55.420]   And the good news is you can perform it
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:57.940]   while still running or while still swimming.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:58.920]   Although I suppose with swimming,
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.220]   you might have to make some adjustments
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:03.660]   because of course you don't want to inhale water
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.760]   or while cycling or any type of activity.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:10.900]   If you perform that physiological sigh
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:12.900]   generally two or three times,
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:14.060]   what will occur is that
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:16.300]   because of changes in the firing of the phrenic nerve
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:19.540]   and in particular because of changes in the sensory feedback
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:21.580]   from the sensory component of the phrenic nerve
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:23.020]   back to the brain,
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.220]   you will experience an alleviation of the pain
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:28.460]   from that right side side stitch.
[01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:30.180]   In other words, you can get rid of side cramps
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:32.500]   during physiological sighs during activities,
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.900]   in particular during running activities.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:36.140]   Now, I should also mention that
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.880]   if you're experiencing a side stitch on the left side,
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.700]   chances are that has to do with excessive air
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:46.020]   or fluid in your stomach.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:47.300]   And there are reasons for that
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:49.420]   that also have to do with the way that the phrenic nerve
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:51.920]   is it's bilateral and branches to both sides
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.760]   and is catching sensory input on the left side
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.460]   from some of the local organs
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:58.460]   and sensory innervation of those organs.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.440]   Okay, but if you have right side side stitch,
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.500]   the physiological side done two or three times
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.980]   while still running ought to relieve that side stitch.
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:06.740]   Now, as long as we're talking about breathing
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.360]   and the phrenic nerve and the relationship
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.140]   between the phrenic nerve and your liver and your stomach
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:14.340]   and some of the other organs in that neighborhood,
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:15.500]   we should talk about the relationship
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.900]   between breathing and heart rate.
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:19.700]   This is an incredibly important topic,
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.800]   so much so that I perhaps should have brought it up
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.380]   at the beginning of the episode.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:28.380]   But nonetheless, you now know what your diaphragm does, right?
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:30.900]   When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.820]   That's right, when you can track your diaphragm,
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:35.260]   it moves down, it creates space for your lungs to inhale.
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:37.700]   And when you exhale, your diaphragm moves up.
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:42.620]   Well, when you inhale and your diaphragm moves down,
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:45.060]   what happens is there's more space created
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.620]   in the thoracic cavity.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.380]   In particular, if you're also breathing deeply
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:49.980]   and you're using those intercostal muscles
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:51.720]   to expand your ribs.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.880]   As a consequence, the heart actually gets
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:54.720]   a little bit bigger.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:57.100]   It's a temporary enlargement in the heart,
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:58.660]   but it's a real enlargement.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:02.060]   And as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.860]   is now in a larger volume 'cause the heart got bigger.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:07.540]   And as a consequence, that blood is moving more slowly
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:11.300]   through that larger volume for a short period of time,
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.960]   but nonetheless, it's moving more slowly.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:17.460]   Your nervous system detects that and sends a neural signal
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:19.420]   to the heart to speed the heart rate up.
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:22.740]   In other words, inhales increase heart rate.
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:26.240]   The opposite is true when you exhale.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:29.540]   When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up,
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:32.140]   your rib cage tends to move inward a bit
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.380]   and you compact the heart.
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:35.580]   You reduce the volume of the heart overall.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:38.620]   When you reduce the volume of the heart overall,
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:41.460]   blood flow through the heart accelerates
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.820]   because it's a smaller volume.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:44.580]   So a given unit of blood is going to move more quickly
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:45.920]   through that small volume.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.340]   Your nervous system detects that and sends a signal
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:51.520]   to slow the heart down.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:54.340]   So just as inhales speed the heart up,
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:57.340]   exhales slow your heart rate down.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:00.180]   Now, of course, even though you can double up on inhales
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:03.220]   or even triple up on inhales, sooner or later,
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:05.940]   if you inhale, you're going to have to exhale, all right?
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.140]   And the converse is also true, of course.
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:09.220]   So what does this mean
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:10.700]   in terms of controlling your heart rate?
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:14.500]   Well, let's say you are going in for a blood draw
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:16.820]   or you're going out on stage and you're stressed.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.940]   Well, I would encourage you to do a physiological side,
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:22.020]   maybe two physiological sides to bring your level of calm up
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.820]   and your level of stress down.
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.620]   Nonetheless, if you have any reason
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:27.700]   why you want to quickly reduce your heart rate
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.620]   or accelerate your heart rate
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:33.020]   for sake of physical work output
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.500]   or to calm yourself down additionally,
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.640]   not just use the physiological side,
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.680]   well, then you can take advantage of this relationship
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:42.380]   between inhales and exhales controlling heart rate.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.520]   If you want to increase your heart rate,
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.080]   you can simply inhale longer and more vigorously
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:49.220]   relative to your exhales.
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:52.260]   And if you want to decrease your heart rate,
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:54.340]   well, then you're going to make your exhales longer
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.540]   and or more vigorous than your inhales.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:58.080]   In fact, this process,
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:00.820]   which is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:03.440]   is the basis of what we call heart rate variability.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.420]   Heart rate variability involves the vagus nerve,
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:06.820]   the 10th cranial nerve,
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.660]   which is a parasympathetic nerve
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.860]   that is associated with a calming aspect
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:12.560]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.820]   slowing your heart rate down by extending your exhales.
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:17.940]   And it really forms the basis of most
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.340]   all breathing practices.
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:21.180]   If you look at any breathing practices,
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:22.500]   whether or not it's Wim Hof breathing,
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:25.660]   Tummo breathing, Kundalini breathing, Pranayama breathing,
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:27.540]   physiological sighing, cyclic sighing,
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:28.780]   and on and on and on.
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:32.460]   If you were to measure the ratio of inhales to exhales
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:34.300]   and the vigor of inhales to exhales,
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.620]   what you would find is that each one would create
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:41.100]   a net increase or a net decrease in heart rate
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:43.500]   that could be very accurately predicted
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.780]   by whether or not that breathing practice
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:49.680]   emphasized inhales, emphasized exhales,
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:53.400]   or had those two features inhale and exhale
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.500]   be of equal duration and intensity.
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:58.020]   In fact, if you wanted to equilibrate your heart rate,
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:00.000]   what you would do is you would do box breathing
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.140]   because inhale, hold, exhale, hold is by definition
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:06.520]   creating equal duration inhales and exhales
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.680]   of essentially equivalent vigor.
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.160]   When you do a physiological sigh,
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.320]   you're doing two big inhales,
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.520]   which is going to speed your heart rate up
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.960]   just a little bit, but then a long extended exhale.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.720]   The exhale in the end is much longer
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.960]   than the two inhales, even when combined.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.880]   And so you get a net decrease in heart rate,
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:24.640]   the calming effect, and then practices
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.400]   such as Tummo breathing or Wim Hof breathing
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:30.920]   or cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales and exhales,
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.560]   or the inhales are more vigorous
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:35.120]   compared to the more passive exhales
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.400]   are going to lead to increases in heart rate, okay?
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.400]   So the relationship between breathing and heart rate
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.400]   is an absolutely lockstep one
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.740]   where your heart rate follows your breathing,
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:46.940]   your heart rate and your breathing
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:49.020]   are in an intimate discussion with one another,
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:51.580]   but where always and forever,
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:53.880]   your inhales increase your heart rate,
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.640]   your exhales decrease it.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:58.000]   Now, this feature, which physicians call
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.940]   respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:02.240]   or we sometimes hear about more often nowadays
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.120]   as heart rate variability is something that people in sport
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.020]   have known about for a very long time.
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:11.680]   It's why, for instance, that marksman will exhale
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.000]   just prior to taking a shot.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.280]   That's particularly true for people
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:15.580]   that compete in the biathlon
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.280]   where they cross-country ski, so their heart rate
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:18.160]   is up, up, up, up, up.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.500]   Then they'll get to the point
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:20.920]   where they actually have to shoot at a target
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:24.140]   and they'll exhale and then they'll shoot at the target.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:25.720]   This is also why, for instance,
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.000]   if you want to bring your heart rate down very quickly
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.680]   between rounds of martial arts,
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.420]   there are a number of different ways to do that,
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:33.480]   but an extended exhale of any kind,
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:36.580]   or frankly, any breathing practice that emphasizes exhales
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.100]   is going to bring your heart rate down.
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:41.160]   This has been incorporated in a number of different contexts,
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.120]   including sport, military.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.840]   It's also now being incorporated in the clinical context
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.300]   for people who feel a panic attack coming on.
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:51.120]   I'm very gratified to learn that the physiological side
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.900]   is now being explored as a tool
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:56.300]   to prevent panic attacks and anxiety attacks.
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:58.020]   This is prior to the panic attack,
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:44:59.420]   people bringing their heart rate down again
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:01.080]   through those extended exhales.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.420]   So learning to extend your exhale
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.700]   is really a terrific skill to master,
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:08.120]   and it's a very easy skill to master, frankly.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.280]   Why do I say a skill?
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.880]   Well, remember what I said earlier,
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.360]   which is that humans inhale actively
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:17.340]   and most typically will passively exhale,
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:20.180]   just let the air drop out of them at whatever rate,
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:22.120]   depending on how much air they inhaled.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:28.200]   Actively exhaling, that is actively relaxing the diaphragm
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.980]   and actively relaxing those intercostal muscles
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:34.580]   of the chest, those ones, or I should say between the ribs,
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:36.940]   is a skill that you can very quickly acquire
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:39.480]   and will allow you to use that relationship
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.020]   between the phrenic nerve, the diaphragm,
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.860]   and the size of the heart, the heart volume,
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:43.700]   and all that stuff,
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.900]   to really take control of heart rate quickly
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:48.440]   so that if you feel like your heart is racing too much,
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.120]   and frankly, a lot of people have a lot of
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.140]   what's called interoceptive awareness,
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:53.100]   especially anxious people,
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:54.920]   they can really sense what's going on in their body,
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.160]   other people less so, like, oh my God, my heart's beating,
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.800]   it's like ready to jump out of my chest,
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.240]   and I don't like that, I don't like that.
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.660]   Big, long exhale.
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.600]   Doesn't matter if you do it through the nose or the mouth,
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.080]   big, long exhale is going to allow you
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:10.120]   to slow your heart rate down.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.660]   Let's talk about hiccups.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.980]   Everybody experiences hiccups from time to time.
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:16.200]   I think most people would agree that one hiccup,
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.960]   sort of funny, two hiccups in a row is really funny,
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.480]   and three hiccups in a row
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.080]   is where it starts to be concerning,
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:25.520]   in part because hiccups can be kind of painful,
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:28.840]   and you experience pain in your gut or your lower abdomen,
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.520]   and sometimes in your chest as well,
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.660]   and it feels kind of intrusive.
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.260]   It gets in the way of having conversation
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.920]   or just sitting there and relaxing.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:38.720]   Fortunately, there's a simple way to get rid of hiccups,
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.880]   and you can arrive at that simple technique
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.000]   if you understand a little bit
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.160]   about what gives rise to hiccups.
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.560]   The reason we get hiccups at all
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:48.800]   is because we experience a spasm of the phrenic nerve.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.420]   The phrenic nerve, as you recall,
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:54.040]   is a nerve that emanates from the cervical region,
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:56.200]   to be specific, C3, four, and five,
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.580]   those spinal nerves go down, of course, behind the heart,
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.920]   and innervate the diaphragm, which is the muscle,
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.320]   then when it contracts, it moves down
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.760]   and allows the lungs to fill,
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:06.320]   and then when you relax the diaphragm,
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:10.320]   then the diaphragm moves up and the lungs shrink,
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.180]   or they expel air, so-called exhalation.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.220]   Now, the phrenic nerve also has that sensory branch,
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:17.480]   so it's not just involved in controlling the diaphragm
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:18.360]   at the motor level,
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.080]   it's also sensing things deep within the diaphragm
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:22.300]   and in the liver as well,
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:24.720]   'cause the liver sits right below the diaphragm.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.000]   So a hiccup has that painful sensation from time to time
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.440]   because there's a rapid sensory feedback,
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.880]   or a signal, rather, of a sharp kind of sensation
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.800]   of contraction within the diaphragm,
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.240]   and that's relayed back to the brain,
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:42.040]   and you consciously perceive that as a little bit of pain,
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.620]   and then, of course, the hiccup is the hiccup,
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:46.260]   which is the spasming of the phrenic nerve
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.720]   that you experience more or less in your throat,
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:50.000]   but all this really is happening along the phrenic nerve
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.200]   and toward the diaphragm.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.000]   What this all means is that if you can stop
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.880]   the phrenic nerve from spasming, you can stop hiccups.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.940]   There are a lot of approaches that people have tried to take
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.140]   to eliminate spasming of the phrenic nerve.
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:03.560]   You'll hear that breathing into a bag,
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:08.280]   which is one way to re-ingest or re-inhale carbon dioxide
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.620]   that otherwise would be expelled out
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:11.200]   into the environment can help.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:13.140]   That's a very indirect method.
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:14.900]   It rarely works, frankly,
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:16.700]   because it really has to do more with adjusting
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:18.620]   your breathing to try and adjust the activity
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:19.440]   of the phrenic nerve.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:22.780]   It's a really roundabout way of trying to alleviate hiccups.
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:25.540]   Some people will experience relief from drinking
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:27.980]   from a glass of water from the opposite side of the glass.
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:29.540]   You sort of have to tilt over at the waist.
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:31.140]   It's a kind of messy approach.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:33.820]   Again, it doesn't tend to work a lot of the time.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:35.060]   For some people, it works every time,
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:37.500]   but for most people, it doesn't work at all.
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.160]   However, there is a technique
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:41.820]   that can reliably eliminate hiccups,
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:43.980]   and it's a technique that takes advantage
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:46.420]   of hyper-contracting the phrenic nerve
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:48.820]   over a short period of time
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:51.860]   so that it then subsequently relaxes
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:55.020]   or alleviates the spasming of the phrenic nerve.
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:59.140]   And that simple method is to inhale three times in a row.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:01.140]   This is a very unusual pattern of breathing,
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:03.520]   but what it involves is taking a big, deep inhale
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:04.780]   through your nose.
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:06.620]   Then before you exhale any air,
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:08.340]   take a second inhale through the nose,
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.860]   however brief that inhale might be,
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:14.580]   and then a third, even micro or millisecond long inhale
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:16.620]   through your nose to get that third inhale,
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.500]   and then hold your breath for about 15 to 20 seconds,
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.980]   and then slowly exhale.
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:23.640]   So even though I'm not experiencing any hiccups right now,
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.500]   I will demonstrate the method for eliminating hiccups
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:26.940]   so that you're all clear on how to do it.
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.020]   Okay, here I go.
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:32.860]   [breathing in and out heavily]
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:48.240]   [breathing out heavily]
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:53.580]   Okay, so it's three inhales all through the nose,
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:56.800]   and it is true that that second and third inhale
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.020]   takes some physical effort to really get additional air
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:03.660]   into the lungs without exhaling first.
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:05.720]   It feels like the only way I can describe it really
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:08.640]   is as a sharp second and third inhale,
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.900]   'cause you really have to engage the musculature
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:12.640]   of those intracostal muscles in the diaphragm
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:13.580]   in order to do it.
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:15.980]   And then that long exhale can be through the nose
[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:18.320]   or the mouth, but I find it particularly relaxing
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.340]   or even pleasant to do it through the nose.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:23.580]   This method of three inhales through the nose
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:25.980]   followed by a long exhale through the nose or mouth
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:28.000]   will eliminate hiccups right away,
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.920]   because what it does is it hyper excites the phrenic nerve
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:33.080]   three times in a row, a very unnatural pattern
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.780]   for the phrenic nerve to fire.
[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:39.260]   And then it undergoes a hyperpolarization, as we call it,
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:41.440]   in which the phrenic nerve actually stands
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.640]   a much lower probability of getting activated again
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.380]   for some period of time afterwards.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:48.700]   So it is important that you try and return
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:50.100]   to normal cadence of breathing
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:52.880]   after doing this three inhales followed by the long exhale.
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.480]   If you need to perform it a second time
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.820]   in order to eliminate hiccups,
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.160]   because they're simply not going away, that's fine.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.140]   You can do that.
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:02.800]   But as far as we know, this is the most efficient
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:05.820]   and science supported way to eliminate hiccups.
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:06.660]   Now, up until now,
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.360]   I've been talking about breathing techniques
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.420]   and I've mainly focused on breathing techniques
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:11.660]   that emphasize the exhale,
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:14.220]   whether or not it's the carbon dioxide tolerance test,
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:16.860]   whether or not it's cyclic sighing
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.920]   or the physiological sigh that you use in real time
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:20.860]   to reduce stress.
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:22.580]   One thing that we haven't talked about so much
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:24.660]   is cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:26.660]   Cyclic hyperventilation, as you recall,
[01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:29.620]   is about of 25 or so breaths,
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:31.020]   inhaling deeply through the nose
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:32.300]   and then passively exhaling,
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:34.700]   or sometimes actively exhaling typically through the mouth.
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:35.900]   So it might look like this.
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:38.420]   [inhales and exhales]
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:40.420]   That's a very active inhale through the nose
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:41.620]   and exhale through the mouth.
[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:44.340]   It can also be done active inhale through the nose,
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:46.540]   passive exhale through the mouth, like so.
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:49.660]   [inhales and exhales]
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.780]   In any event, that pattern of breathing
[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:53.540]   repeated for 10 to 25 breaths
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:55.900]   greatly increases levels of autonomic arousal.
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:59.780]   In fact, it's known to deploy adrenaline from the adrenals.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:04.660]   And in our study, we had people then expel all their air,
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:07.600]   so breathe out, hold their breath for 15 to 30 seconds,
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.600]   and then repeat for a period of five minutes.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.340]   That did lead to some very interesting
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:12.940]   and positive physiological changes
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:14.820]   in terms of stress mitigation,
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:16.860]   although not as significant as was observed
[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:19.780]   with cyclic sighing, as I talked about earlier.
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:23.260]   Now, there is a lot of interest in cyclic hyperventilation
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:26.060]   for sake of, for instance, extending breath holds.
[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:27.620]   This has become popular in part
[01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:29.220]   because of the so-called Wim Hof method,
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:32.340]   which is a method that combines breathing,
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:33.420]   cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:36.880]   followed by lungs full or lungs empty breath holds,
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.180]   depending on which variant
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.120]   of the Wim Hof method one is using.
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.880]   Separately, and I really want to emphasize separately,
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:45.460]   the Wim Hof method also involves deliberate cold exposure,
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:47.140]   which, as all of you know, I'm a big fan of,
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:49.180]   and we've done episodes of this podcast on,
[01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:50.940]   and we have toolkits on deliberate cold exposure
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:53.540]   for increasing dopamine levels, epinephrine levels,
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:55.460]   immune system function, et cetera.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:57.020]   Wim Hof method also incorporates that,
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:58.780]   and it has a mindfulness component.
[01:52:58.780 --> 01:52:59.940]   I do want to caution people
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.900]   that anytime you're doing cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:05.320]   you want to be very cautious about not doing it
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.580]   in or near water,
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:08.540]   because it does greatly increase the risk
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:10.260]   of shallow water blackout.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:13.140]   And that's because when you do cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:13.980]   you are expelling,
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:17.060]   you're exhaling more carbon dioxide than usual.
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:18.580]   And what I haven't told you yet
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:20.980]   is that the trigger to breathe
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:24.540]   is actually an increase in carbon dioxide.
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:26.940]   What I mean by that is you have a small set of neurons
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:30.160]   in your brainstem that can detect when carbon dioxide levels
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.860]   in your bloodstream reach a certain level,
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:33.300]   and when they reach that level,
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:37.880]   they trigger the gas reflex and/or the hunger for breathing.
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:40.740]   In other words, we don't breathe because we crave oxygen,
[01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:44.140]   although we do need oxygen, of course, in order to survive,
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.180]   and for our brain to function
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:46.980]   and our bodily organs to function,
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:51.660]   but our brain is wired such that it has a threat sensor,
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.660]   which is carbon dioxide levels are getting too high,
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:57.500]   and that's what triggers the motor reflex to breathe
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.500]   and to, in some cases, gasp for air,
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:02.160]   depending on how starved for air we are.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:04.140]   So if you do cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.780]   whether or not it's Wim Hof method
[01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:07.820]   or whether or not it's Tummo method,
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:09.020]   again, these things are similar.
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:10.080]   They're not exactly the same.
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:11.420]   There are other breathing methods
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:13.780]   that incorporate cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:14.820]   What you're doing is you're getting rid
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.060]   of a lot of carbon dioxide,
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.700]   and therefore you're removing the impulse
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:20.060]   or lowering the impulse to breathe
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:21.700]   so that when you enter that breath hold phase
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:23.060]   after the hyperventilation,
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.900]   it's a much longer period of time
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:27.400]   before you feel the anxiety and the hunger
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.860]   and the impulse to breathe.
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:31.260]   That's one of the real benefits of any technique
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:33.580]   that incorporates cyclic hyperventilation
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:37.260]   is that rather than reduce your stress level in real time,
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:38.540]   it actually does the opposite.
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:39.940]   It increases your stress level.
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:42.540]   It increases your level of autonomic arousal,
[01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:44.220]   but you're doing it deliberately.
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:45.860]   And then during those breath holds,
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:48.220]   what's happening is you have a lot of adrenaline
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:50.020]   circulating in your system
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:51.980]   because of the way that hyperventilation
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:54.840]   triggers the release of adrenaline from your adrenal glands.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.620]   It also triggers the release of epinephrine,
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:58.180]   which is the same as adrenaline
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:00.140]   from a little brain area called locus coeruleus,
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:01.460]   which makes you feel more alert.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:03.760]   And then during those breath holds
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.080]   and in the subsequent rounds of cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:08.980]   people experience what it is
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:10.820]   to have a lot of adrenaline in their system,
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:13.800]   but they are controlling the release of that adrenaline,
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.760]   which is far and away different than when life events
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:18.340]   are triggering that adrenaline.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.180]   So what it really is
[01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:22.060]   is a form of self-induced stress inoculation.
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.580]   And I do think there are benefits
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:25.440]   to practicing cyclic hyperventilation
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.120]   because it does allow you to learn
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.680]   how to self deploy adrenaline and epinephrine
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:31.740]   from locus coeruleus and from the adrenals,
[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:33.020]   or I got that backwards,
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:34.420]   adrenaline from your adrenals
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:36.480]   and epinephrine from locus coeruleus.
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.580]   And it allows you to explore
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:42.280]   what it is to maintain calm state of mind and body
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:44.820]   when you have a lot of adrenaline in your system,
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:47.380]   which certain studies are starting to show
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:49.820]   can allow people to be able to lean
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.660]   into the stressful aspects of life.
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:54.420]   And let's be honest, life is stressful in any event.
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:56.100]   Now we're all going to experience stress
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:57.220]   at some point or another.
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:58.780]   And when we do,
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:00.820]   we want to make sure that we're not overtaken
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:03.300]   by the release of adrenaline from the adrenals,
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:06.120]   that sudden surge of epinephrine from locus coeruleus.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:07.960]   So doing cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.700]   maybe one or two times per week,
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:14.320]   again, 25 breaths, active inhale, passive or active exhale.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.900]   Do expect to feel tingly
[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:17.640]   because of that reduction in carbon dioxide
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.060]   from exhaling so much.
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:21.360]   Do expect to feel a little bit agitated.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.640]   Be very careful doing this
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.320]   if you're somebody who has anxiety attacks
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:27.500]   or somebody who has panic attacks or disorders of any kind.
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:28.960]   But if you don't and you want to explore this,
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:31.680]   you'll notice you start to feel really ramped up.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:33.260]   And then during the breath holds,
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:36.800]   which again can be done by exhaling and stopping
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:40.060]   for some period of time, 15, maybe even 60 seconds,
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:41.520]   is a time in which you can explore
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:43.700]   how to remain mentally calm.
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.560]   Some people even choose to do math problems
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:47.660]   or think of things in a kind of structured way
[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:51.500]   while they have a lot of these hormone neurotransmitters
[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:54.380]   circulating at high levels in their system.
[01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:57.860]   In other words, as a way to learn to manage your mind
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:59.920]   and body under conditions of stress.
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:00.880]   Now, if you are somebody
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.420]   who's using deliberate cold exposure,
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:05.780]   either cold showers or ice baths or cold immersion,
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:09.660]   I often get asked how best to breathe
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:12.240]   during those different types of activities.
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:13.980]   Really, there's no best way to breathe.
[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:16.780]   Although if you wanted to turn those activities
[01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:19.120]   into their own form of stress inoculation,
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:21.920]   again, please don't use cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:22.760]   It's dangerous.
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:24.640]   I don't recommend it whatsoever.
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:28.400]   But you can try to actively slow your breathing.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:29.740]   That is to make sure
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:32.020]   that you're engaging in rhythmic breathing.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.020]   Now, up until now,
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:35.300]   I've said that rhythmic breathing is the default.
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.700]   Pre-bot singer nucleus controlling rhythmic breathing
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:38.540]   is the default.
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:40.900]   And that doubling up on inhales and exhales
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:44.380]   is something that happens when you deliberately take over
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:46.700]   the action of pre-bot singer complex.
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:49.620]   Now, that's true 99% of the time.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:51.220]   However, there are certain conditions
[01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:54.740]   such as conditions of heightened state of emotional arousal.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.900]   Right, if you think about somebody who's been crying,
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:59.700]   oftentimes they'll do the double inhale exhale
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:01.540]   that says, or triple inhales,
[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:04.300]   or if somebody is very, very afraid, it's all inhales.
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:06.860]   Okay, so it does sometimes happen spontaneously.
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:09.340]   Actually, when we get into very cold water,
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:12.040]   there's a very robust decrease
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.820]   in the activation of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:16.020]   which is the area of brain real estate
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:18.780]   right behind the forehead that controls structured thinking,
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:22.320]   your ability to reason and make sense of what's going on.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:23.420]   If you get into really cold water,
[01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:25.620]   you should not expect that brain region to work
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:27.380]   or at least not work very well at all
[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:28.880]   for the first 20 or 30 seconds
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:30.740]   that you're in the cold water.
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:33.120]   From the time you get into cold water,
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.640]   'cause here we're talking about deliberate cold exposure,
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:38.220]   I encourage you to try and control your breathing
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:39.260]   and make it rhythmic.
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:42.520]   That is inhales, follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:45.280]   even if they have to be fast, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.120]   Why?
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:47.580]   Because the default,
[01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:49.920]   when we get into a stressful circumstance,
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:52.100]   emotionally or physically stressful circumstance,
[01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:54.660]   is that rhythmic breathing stops
[01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:56.800]   and that parafacial nucleus takes over
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:00.260]   and it's, and it's that kind of panicky mode.
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:02.900]   And by simply controlling our breath,
[01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:05.220]   again, even if it's fast,
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:07.280]   from inhale to exhale and making sure
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.780]   that we're alternating inhales and exhales rhythmically,
[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:11.720]   and what you'll find is that you'll be able to navigate
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:15.320]   that what would otherwise be a very stressful circumstance
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:18.920]   and make it less stressful or maybe even pleasant.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:21.580]   And that skill definitely translates
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:23.420]   to other aspects of life in which, you know,
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:25.540]   you're hit square in the face with something stressful,
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:27.840]   you'll notice your breathing and your pattern of breathing
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:31.260]   switching to multiple inhales or, you know,
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:34.460]   breath holding essentially departing from rhythmic breathing
[01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:36.580]   and by quickly returning to rhythmic breathing
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:38.220]   and maybe even trying to slow the breathing
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:39.640]   and extend those exhales,
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:42.600]   you'll find that you can very quickly calm down.
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:44.220]   Next, I'd like to discuss what I find to be
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:46.120]   an absolutely fascinating topic.
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.000]   It's also one that's highly useful in the world,
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.740]   which is how your specific patterns of breathing
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:55.140]   relate to your ability to learn and to remember information,
[01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:58.180]   how we can modulate fear and a number of other aspects
[01:59:58.180 --> 02:00:00.340]   of how your brain functions.
[02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:02.740]   This is a literature that's been reviewed recently
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:06.180]   and a lot of exquisite detail in a beautiful review
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:08.000]   by Jack Feldman, who I mentioned earlier,
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.540]   one of the pioneers of the neuroscience of breathing.
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:14.420]   The title of the review is "Breathing Rhythm and Pattern
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:16.100]   and Their Influence on Emotion."
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:18.580]   Again, we'll provide a link to this review
[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:19.880]   in the show note captions.
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:23.900]   This review includes discussion of several studies,
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:27.380]   one in particular that I'll get into in a bit of detail
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:30.660]   that describes the following.
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:33.980]   Right now, I just want you to breathe regularly,
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:35.220]   meaning rhythmically.
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:37.100]   You can inhale and exhale through your mouth
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:37.940]   or through your nose.
[02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:39.420]   I'd prefer that you do it through your nose
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:40.860]   because nasal breathing,
[02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:42.940]   unless you need to breathe through your mouth
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:45.300]   because of heart exercise or eating or talking
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:47.620]   is always going to be the better way to go.
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:50.360]   Nasal breathing improves the aesthetic of your face.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:51.200]   That's been shown.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.940]   We'll talk about that just briefly in a few minutes.
[02:00:52.940 --> 02:00:55.340]   Nasal breathing improves the amount of oxygen
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:57.020]   you can bring into your system, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:00:57.020 --> 02:00:59.940]   Okay, so just breathe, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:04.780]   And know that during your exhales, your pupil,
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:07.780]   that is the pupil of your eye, is getting bigger.
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:12.080]   And as you exhale, it's getting smaller.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:15.120]   In addition, when you inhale,
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:18.260]   your reaction time to anything that happens around you,
[02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:19.680]   a car swerving in front of you,
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:21.620]   something that you might detect in the periphery
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:24.020]   of your vision or here off in the distance
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:27.260]   increases significantly compared to when you're exhaling.
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:30.540]   In addition, when you are inhaling,
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:32.600]   your ability to remember things,
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:35.820]   especially things that take a bit of effort to remember
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:38.620]   and your ability to learn new information
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:42.420]   is significantly greater than it is when you're exhaling.
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:44.180]   Now, as you hear all that, you're probably thinking,
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:45.460]   okay, how do I just inhale?
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.040]   Well, of course, that's not going to be the best approach.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.300]   You need to exhale as well
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:52.220]   for all the reasons you now are well aware of.
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:54.140]   But what these findings really illustrate,
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.200]   and I should mention these findings
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:57.100]   are all carried out in humans, all right?
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:59.340]   So these relate to some stuff in animal studies,
[02:01:59.340 --> 02:02:01.220]   but what I just described has been shown
[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:03.940]   in human studies consistently.
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:06.600]   When we inhale, and in particular,
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.700]   when we inhale through our nose,
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:12.020]   our brain is not functioning in the same way
[02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:13.180]   as when we exhale.
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:15.080]   Now, that doesn't mean that our brain is functioning
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.720]   in a deficient way when we exhale.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:19.920]   It just doesn't function as well
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.280]   as it relates to memory retrieval, memory formation,
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.540]   and some other aspects of cognition.
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:28.660]   Now, you might be asking, why in the world would this be?
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:32.140]   Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:34.120]   and anyone that tells you that they were,
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:35.980]   you should back away from quickly.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:37.860]   But one reasonable explanation
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:39.320]   for why our brain functions better,
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:41.600]   at least in the context of what I just talked about,
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:46.600]   when we inhale is because the olfactory system
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:49.680]   is actually the most ancient sensory system
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:51.540]   of all the sensory systems we have.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:54.900]   So before vision, before audition, before touch,
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:55.900]   before all of that,
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:58.900]   the olfactory system is the most ancient system.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:00.620]   And the olfactory system, of course,
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:03.260]   is designed to detect chemicals in the environment.
[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:06.440]   And so if you imagine an early organism
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.980]   that perhaps we evolved from, or perhaps we didn't,
[02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:11.140]   but nonetheless that we share some features of,
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:13.260]   at least in terms of olfactory function,
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:18.240]   in order to get that chemical information into the brain,
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.260]   we need to inhale.
[02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:20.460]   We need to bring that information in.
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:21.560]   Now, for aquatic animals,
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:23.160]   they could take it in through water,
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:27.140]   but for animals that are terrestrial, that live on land,
[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:29.820]   they would have to get it through the air.
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:32.020]   So inhalation, we know,
[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:34.940]   activates certain regions of the so-called piriform cortex.
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:37.760]   These are areas of the neocortex that are more ancient,
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:40.700]   as well as increasing the activity of brain areas,
[02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:42.080]   such as the hippocampus,
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:44.280]   which is a brain area involved in learning and memory.
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:45.340]   In fact, one of the studies
[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:47.600]   that illustrates this most beautifully
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:50.400]   is a study that was published in the Journal of Neuroscience
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:51.460]   in 2016.
[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:53.980]   By the way, Journal of Neuroscience is a very fine journal.
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:55.420]   And the title of this paper is
[02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:58.740]   Nasal Respiration in Transhuman Limbic Oscillations
[02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:00.660]   and Modulates Cognitive Function.
[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:03.480]   This is a paper that followed up on an earlier paper
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:07.520]   that showed that when people breathe in through their nose,
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:10.140]   their recognition and their discrimination
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:12.460]   of different odors was far greater
[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:15.000]   than when they breathe in through their mouth.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.300]   Now, that result was interesting,
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:17.740]   but it was also sort of a duh
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:20.040]   because you smell things with your nose, not your mouth.
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:21.120]   You taste things with your mouth
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:22.000]   and you speak with your mouth,
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:22.840]   and there are a bunch of other things
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:23.660]   you can do with your mouth.
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:28.640]   But nonetheless, that study pointed to the idea
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:32.820]   that the brain is different during nasal inhalations
[02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:35.840]   versus nasal exhalations
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.960]   versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:40.640]   What it basically showed is that the brain
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:42.500]   ramps up its levels of activity
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:45.240]   and that signal to noise that we talked about earlier,
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.200]   if you recall, that ability for the brain
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:49.400]   to detect things in the environment
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:51.960]   is increased during inhalations.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:55.280]   But because that earlier study focused on smell,
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:57.960]   on olfaction, there was a bit of a confound there.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.460]   It was hard to separate out the variable.
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:01.200]   So this paper, the one I just mentioned,
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.420]   Nasal Respiration in Transhuman Limbic Oscillations
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:05.320]   and Modulates Cognitive Function,
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.460]   did not look at detection of odors.
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:12.240]   Rather, it looked at things like reaction time or fear.
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:15.920]   And basically what it found is that reaction time
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:19.760]   is greatly reduced when people are inhaling.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:21.500]   So they had people look at fearful stimuli.
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:23.440]   They looked at their reaction time to fearful stimuli.
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:24.860]   In other words, their ability to detect
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:26.120]   certain kinds of stimuli.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:27.780]   And they were given a lot of different kinds of stimuli.
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:29.980]   So they had to be able to discriminate
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:31.680]   between one sort of, oops, excuse me,
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:33.480]   one, by the way, folks, for those listening,
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:36.640]   I just bumped the microphone, getting rather animated here.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:39.160]   What these subjects had to do was detect
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:41.840]   one type of stimulus versus another stimulus
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:43.800]   that they were being exposed to.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:46.280]   And what they found is if people were inhaling
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:49.040]   as that fear-inducing stimulus was presented,
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:51.480]   their reaction time to notice it was much, much faster.
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:54.560]   And they related that to patterns of brain activity.
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:55.840]   And they were able to do that
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:59.080]   because they were actually recording from the brain directly
[02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:00.040]   from beneath the skull.
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:02.440]   And they were able to do that because they had some patients
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:04.840]   that had intracranial electrodes embedded in their brain
[02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:07.580]   for sake of trying to detect epileptic seizures.
[02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.920]   So there's a lot to this study
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:11.640]   and a lot that we could discuss,
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:16.400]   but the basic takeaway is that when people are inhaling,
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:18.760]   that is when they're drawing air in
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:21.120]   through their nose in particular,
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:23.480]   their ability to detect what's going on
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:26.080]   in the world around them is greatly enhanced
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:30.400]   and not just for fear, but also for surprise of all sorts.
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:32.160]   So when people are inhaling,
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:34.360]   their ability to detect novel stimuli,
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:38.360]   things that are unexpected or that are unusual
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:41.040]   in their environment is significantly increased.
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:42.600]   Again, we'll put a link to this study as well.
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:44.340]   I find it to be one of the more interesting studies
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.200]   in this realm.
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.720]   Although there are now many additional studies
[02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:50.200]   that support this statement that I made earlier,
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:53.880]   which is that during inhalation, also called inspiration,
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:56.380]   there are a number of very fast physiological changes,
[02:06:56.380 --> 02:06:58.320]   such as changes in pupil diameter,
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:00.400]   changes in the activity of the hippocampus,
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:03.200]   this memory encoding and retrieval area of the brain
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:04.640]   and other areas of the brain.
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:07.040]   So what's the tool takeaway from this?
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:10.480]   If you are sitting down to read or research
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:13.580]   or study or you really want to learn some information,
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:15.600]   maybe you're listening to a podcast
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:19.260]   or some other sorts of information that you want to retain,
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:23.280]   it actually makes sense to increase the duration
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:26.600]   or the intensity of your inhales as you do that.
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:29.240]   The more that you're inhaling relative to exhaling
[02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:30.620]   in terms of duration,
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:33.520]   the more that your brain is in this focused mode
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.360]   and this mode of being able to access
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.440]   and retrieve information better.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:40.200]   Now there's one caveat to this that I think is important
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:42.400]   because I know a number of people listen to this podcast
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:43.540]   for sake of gleaning tools,
[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:44.840]   not just for cognitive enhancement,
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.460]   but for physical enhancement.
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:50.440]   It turns out that when you are inhaling air,
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:55.220]   you're actually less able, or I should say less efficient
[02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:57.680]   at generating voluntary movements.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:59.600]   Now that might come as a surprise.
[02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:00.820]   You know, up until now,
[02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:02.920]   we've basically been talking about inhalation is great,
[02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:04.120]   almost to the point where you wonder like,
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:05.840]   is exhalation good for anything, right?
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:06.720]   You don't want to over-breathe
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:08.000]   and kick out too much carbon dioxide.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.720]   Well, of course, exhalation is great for things.
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:12.080]   In fact, if you're somebody that's played baseball
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:14.300]   or softball, what are you told?
[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:15.920]   That you should exhale on the swing
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:18.060]   to generate the maximum amount of power.
[02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:21.360]   If you're somebody who has done martial arts of any kind,
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.240]   it was traditional Western boxing.
[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:26.920]   As you strike, that's where people typically do the hiya,
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:28.880]   laying the sort of classic karate type thing.
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:29.920]   That's more of a movie thing.
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:32.500]   I don't know whether or not people actually use the hiya,
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:35.040]   but in boxing, oftentimes people will do the shh.
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.920]   You know, they'll do a rapid exhalation,
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:41.040]   a forceful exhalation, keeping in mind, again,
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.420]   that inhales typically are active.
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:45.820]   They engage the diaphragmatic muscle.
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:48.000]   They engage those intercostal muscles,
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.640]   whereas exhales tend to be passive
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:51.960]   unless we take active control of the exhale.
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:55.860]   And indeed, our ability to generate fast, directed,
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:58.640]   so-called volitional voluntary movements
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:02.280]   is greatly enhanced if we do them during the exhale,
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:03.720]   not the inhale.
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:07.600]   Now, with all of that said, I haven't yet really talked
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:09.500]   about mouth versus nasal breathing.
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.820]   And it really can be a fairly short discussion
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:15.760]   because what abundant data now show
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:17.280]   and has been beautifully described
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:19.560]   in the book called "Jaws, a Hidden Epidemic,"
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.560]   this is a book that was written by Paul Ehrlich
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:22.820]   and Sandra Kahn, my colleagues
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:23.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:27.520]   It has an introduction and a forward from Jared Diamond
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:29.000]   and from the great Robert Sapolsky,
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.940]   so some real heavy hitters on this book.
[02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:33.540]   What that book really describes is that
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:36.640]   whenever possible, meaning unless you're speaking or eating
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:39.420]   or you're exercising or other activities require
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.540]   some change in your pattern of breathing,
[02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:43.760]   we should really all be striving to breathe
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:46.120]   through our nose, not through our mouth.
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.260]   And that relates to the increased resistance
[02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:50.000]   to breathing through the nose we talked about earlier.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.920]   Again, I'll say it a third time,
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:54.440]   that increased resistance through the nose allows you
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:56.240]   to inflate your lungs more, not less.
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:57.620]   The other thing that breathing through your nose
[02:09:57.620 --> 02:10:01.320]   allows you to do is it both warms and moisturizes the air
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:02.380]   that you bring into your lungs,
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:04.820]   which is more favorable for lung health
[02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:06.680]   than breathing through the mouth.
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:08.040]   Hard breathing through the mouth
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:11.080]   or simply mouth breathing at all is actually quite damaging
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.180]   or can be, I should say, quite damaging
[02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:15.160]   to some of the respiratory functions of your lungs.
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:17.720]   That of course does not mean that you shouldn't breathe hard
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:19.280]   through your mouth when you're running or sprinting
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:22.320]   or exercising hard, but you don't want mouth breathing
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:25.560]   to be the chronic default pattern that you follow.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:28.720]   Nasal breathing is the best pattern of breathing to follow
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.380]   as a default state.
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:31.840]   Another aspect of nasal breathing
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:34.020]   that's really beneficial is that the gas,
[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:37.440]   nitric oxide, is actually created in the nasal passages.
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:42.440]   It's a gas that can cause relaxation of the smooth muscles
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:45.760]   that relate to the vasculature, not just of your nose,
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:48.720]   but of your brain and for all the tissues of your body.
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.200]   This is why nasal breathing and not mouth breathing
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:54.680]   is great for when you want to relieve congestion.
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:56.640]   So a lot of these things seem counterintuitive, right?
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:57.480]   Your nose is stuffed,
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:00.460]   so that mainly makes people breathe through their mouth,
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:02.040]   but it turns out that breathing through your nose
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:05.600]   will allow some dilation of the vasculature,
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:08.440]   more blood flow, dilation of the nasal passages,
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.840]   and delivery of nitric oxide to all the tissues of your body
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.760]   and that dilation of the small capillaries
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:17.900]   that innervate essentially every organ of your body,
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.540]   allow the delivery of more nutrients
[02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:24.160]   and the removal of carbon dioxide and other waste products
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:25.740]   from those tissues more readily
[02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:27.900]   than if you're not getting enough, excuse me,
[02:11:27.900 --> 02:11:29.620]   nitric oxide into your system.
[02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:31.880]   Okay, so a lot of reasons to be a nasal breather.
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:33.720]   If you want to check out that book, "Jaws,"
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:35.580]   "Hidden Epidemics," it's a terrific read,
[02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:38.280]   and it also shows some absolutely striking pictures,
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:39.680]   twin studies and so forth,
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:41.640]   and some before and afters of people
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:44.120]   and the aesthetic changes that they experienced
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:46.480]   when they shifted from being a mouth breather
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:47.980]   to a nose breather.
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:49.760]   These are striking examples
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:51.660]   that have been observed over and over again.
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:53.000]   When people mouth breathe,
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.240]   there's an elongation of the jaw,
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:57.040]   droopiness of the eyelids,
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:59.440]   and the entire jaw structure really changes
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:02.040]   in ways that are not aesthetically favorable.
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.580]   Fortunately, when people switch
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:05.120]   to becoming nasal breathers,
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:07.600]   and of course that takes some encouragement
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:08.800]   either by mouth taping
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:12.240]   or doing their cardiovascular exercise with mouth closed
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:13.960]   or by doing the sorts of exercises
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:15.100]   that we talked about earlier,
[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:18.280]   when they switch to becoming nasal breathers by default,
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:20.040]   the aesthetic changes that occur
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:23.120]   are very dramatic and very favorable,
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:26.480]   including sort of elevation of the eyebrows,
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.040]   not in an artificial sense
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.900]   or in a kind of outrageous way,
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:31.440]   but elevation of the cheekbones,
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:32.880]   sharpening of the jaw,
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:35.240]   and most notably improvements of the teeth
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:36.760]   and the entire jaw structure.
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:38.240]   In fact, one simple test
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:41.120]   of whether or not you can be an efficient nasal breather
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:43.680]   and whether or not you've been nasal breathing efficiently
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:44.940]   or most of the time in the past,
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:45.920]   or whether or not you've been relying
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.860]   more on mouth breathing,
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:49.240]   that was described in the book "Jaws"
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:51.880]   is you should be able to close your mouth
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:54.160]   and breathe only through your nose.
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.000]   Again, this is at rest,
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.800]   not during exercise necessarily,
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:58.420]   though you might do it during exercise,
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:12:59.660]   but close your mouth,
[02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:02.080]   put your tongue on the roof of your mouth,
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:04.000]   and it should fit behind your teeth,
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.400]   and you should be able to nose breathe in that position.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:10.440]   And many people won't be able to do that,
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:12.280]   but fortunately, as I mentioned earlier,
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:13.840]   if you nasal breathe,
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:16.640]   that is you deliberately nasal breathe when at rest
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.240]   for some period of time,
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:21.560]   you will experience an increased ability to nasal breathe,
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:25.080]   and you should also experience some addition of space
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:27.860]   within the palate of your mouth
[02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:30.080]   to allow your tongue to sit more completely
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.020]   on the roof of your mouth.
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:32.440]   This is especially true for children
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:33.400]   that perform this technique.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.840]   Again, I refer you to the book "Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic."
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:37.200]   It's an absolutely spectacular book.
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:39.040]   You can also just look online
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:40.920]   before and after "Jaws, Hidden Epidemic"
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:43.060]   and look at some of the changes in facial structure
[02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:46.220]   that occur when people move from mouth to nasal breathing,
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:48.160]   and it's really quite striking.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:50.900]   So during today's episode, per always,
[02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:52.200]   we covered a lot of information.
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.240]   First, we talked about the mechanical aspects of breathing,
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:59.160]   the lungs, the diaphragm, the trachea, and so forth.
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:01.200]   We also talked about the chemical aspects of breathing,
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:02.920]   that really, breathing is a way
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:04.960]   that we bring oxygen to ourselves
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:07.140]   and that we get the correct levels,
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:09.400]   or I should say we maintain the correct levels
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:11.000]   of carbon dioxide in our system,
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.180]   neither too much nor too little,
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:16.000]   in order to allow oxygen to do its magic
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.660]   and to allow carbon dioxide to do its magic,
[02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:20.260]   because as you learned during today's episode,
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:23.060]   carbon dioxide is not just a waste by-product.
[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:25.800]   It has very critical physiological functions.
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:27.560]   You need to have enough of it around,
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:29.820]   and therefore you don't want to over-breathe,
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:31.480]   especially at rest.
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:32.940]   We talked about a tool to measure
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:34.700]   how well you manage carbon dioxide,
[02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:37.540]   the so-called carbon dioxide tolerance test,
[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:41.640]   and various exercises that you can use simply by breathing
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:44.360]   to decrease your stress in real time,
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:46.880]   decrease your stress chronically around the clock,
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.900]   obviously that's a good thing,
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:49.660]   improve sleep, improve mood,
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.920]   how to increase breath hold times
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:53.620]   and why you might want to do that,
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:55.820]   also how to eliminate hiccups.
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:57.240]   We talked about how to breathe
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:59.480]   in order to eliminate the side stitch or side cramp
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.520]   that you might experience during exercise,
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:04.360]   and how to breathe in order to improve learning and memory,
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:07.080]   reaction time, and various other aspects
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:09.320]   of cognitive and physical function.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:12.820]   I do realize it's a lot of information, but as always,
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:15.640]   I try and give you information that is clear,
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:17.360]   hopefully interesting as well,
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:20.460]   and actionable toward a number of different end points.
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:22.100]   So if you're somebody that's just now
[02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:24.420]   starting to think about the application of breath work,
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:26.740]   I would encourage you to please, yes,
[02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:28.380]   do the carbon dioxide tolerance test.
[02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:30.360]   That will give you some window into how well
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:31.940]   or how poorly you're managing breathing.
[02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:33.740]   And then here's the great news.
[02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:35.740]   The great news is that breath work,
[02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:38.260]   that is deliberate respiration practices,
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:42.020]   are very effective at creating change very quickly.
[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:44.980]   In some cases, such as the use of the physiological psi
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:46.820]   or cyclic hyperventilation,
[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:49.040]   those changes can be experienced the first time
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:52.000]   and every time, because again, these are not hacks.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.100]   These are aspects of your breathing apparati,
[02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:57.340]   including the mechanical stuff and the neural stuff
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:00.940]   and the gas exchange stuff, all of which you were born with,
[02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:02.880]   and that are available to you at any moment.
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:05.580]   So all you really have to do is explore them
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:08.080]   and deploy them as you feel necessary.
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.340]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:35.960]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:38.320]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.660]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:16:39.660 --> 02:16:42.100]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:43.540]   we discuss supplements.
[02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:45.680]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:47.680]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:50.420]   for things like improving sleep, hormone function,
[02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:51.900]   cognitive function, and so on.
[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:53.540]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:54.680]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:55.900]   We've done that for several reasons.
[02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:57.640]   First of all, Momentous Supplements
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:59.180]   are of the very highest quality.
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:01.740]   Second of all, Momentous Supplements tend to center
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:04.040]   around single ingredient formulations.
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:05.660]   This is incredibly important
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:07.540]   because if you're going to include supplements
[02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:09.180]   in your daily regimen,
[02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:11.320]   you're going to want to use the right supplements
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:12.340]   in the right dosages,
[02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:14.380]   and you want to do that in the most biologically
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:15.460]   and cost-effective way.
[02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:17.920]   And single ingredient formulations are the only way
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:19.180]   that you can determine what works
[02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:20.740]   and what doesn't work for you.
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:23.440]   And it's the only way in which you can adjust the dosage
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:25.460]   of given supplements or maybe even alternate days
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:27.020]   that you take one and not the other
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:28.900]   in a way that really allows you to home in
[02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:30.860]   on which supplements are going to be ideal
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:33.480]   for your mental health, physical health, and performance.
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:36.100]   Also, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,
[02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:38.180]   and that's great because we know a number of you reside
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:39.620]   outside of the United States.
[02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:41.180]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:42.620]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:44.860]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:47.660]   so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:49.780]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:52.280]   we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:53.480]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:56.340]   And I should mention that on all those platforms,
[02:17:56.340 --> 02:17:58.180]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:17:59.780]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:01.100]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:02.380]   but much of which is distinct
[02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:04.340]   from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:07.100]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:08.500]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:10.300]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:13.020]   it is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:15.360]   in which we give a summaries of podcast episodes
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:17.380]   and toolkits, for instance, toolkit for sleep,
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:18.700]   toolkit for managing dopamine,
[02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:20.500]   toolkit for deliberate cold exposure.
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:22.920]   Again, it's all zero cost to sign up.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.300]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu function,
[02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:28.700]   scroll down to newsletter, and you supply your email.
[02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:30.740]   We do not share your email with anybody else.
[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:32.740]   And there are also some example newsletters
[02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:35.360]   there at HubermanLab.com for you to explore.
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:37.340]   Once again, I'd like to thank you for today's discussion
[02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:40.620]   all about the biology and application of breathing.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:42.780]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:44.620]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:47.200]   [upbeat music]
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:49.780]   (gentle music)
