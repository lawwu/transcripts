[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   I always think it's funny that, you know, when I talk about looking for flights to places,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.280]   I'm always like, "Well, I couldn't find business class, so we're going to find another date."
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.920]   Just to be clear, I don't think I've ever spent the $5,000 to $20,000 those business class flights
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.520]   take, right? This is not me speaking out of a desire to spend on that level of luxury.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.440]   It's just that if you figure out how to use these tools, if you figure out how to time the card
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.120]   bonuses and your spend, you end up getting to a point that you're somewhat spoiled to the fact
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.040]   that you can find a way to do it in a premium cabin at a very reasonable price almost every time.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.440]   Exactly. The points and miles, it's amazing. It lets you do things like this routinely
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.760]   that you would have never even considered forking out the cash to do.
