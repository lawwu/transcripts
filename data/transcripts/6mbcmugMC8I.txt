[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.060]   the first part of the fourteenth verse of the sixth chapter of the epistle of Paul to
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.260]   the Ephesians.
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.980]   The epistle to the Ephesians, chapter six, and the first part of the fourteenth verse.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:26.020]   Stand therefore, having your lines girt about with truth.
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.060]   Now we are engaged on this most important subject of trying to discover what it is exactly
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.780]   that the apostle is telling us in those words.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.780]   He has made it abundantly clear that unless we are strengthened with the power that comes
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.820]   alone from God himself through the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit, and in addition
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.500]   to put on the whole armor of God that we stand no chance, no hope whatsoever in our fight
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.900]   against the wiles of the devil and in our wrestling with the principalities and powers,
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.140]   the rulers of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.820]   And we are now examining this whole exhortation as to putting on the whole armor of God.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.020]   And the first piece we have to put on, the most vital in many senses, is this first one.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.700]   The lines must be girt about with truth.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.020]   But the question is, as I have been pointing out, what is this?
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.420]   How are we to implement this exhortation?
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.740]   What exactly have we got to do?
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.020]   And immediately we are face to face with the whole problem of authority.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.580]   What is truth?
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.860]   We ask that not as Pilate asked it, but we must ask it.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.220]   We cannot be girded about with truth unless we know what it is.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.420]   And therefore we are face to face with this greatest of all modern problems in the Christian
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.160]   Church, the problem of authority.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.600]   And we have come to the conclusion that there is only one authority, and that is this book
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.020]   which we call the Bible.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.820]   We do not trust any church, finally.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.020]   The history of the church itself is enough to deliver us from that error.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:32.200]   The church herself can fall, and has fallen, into grievous error many times.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.220]   So the church must be judged by something else, by some other standard.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.980]   It is the same with reason and philosophy; it is the same with experience.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.480]   It is not that we are saying that these things have no value, but we are saying that they
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.780]   are not to be regarded as the ultimate, the final authority.
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.920]   And so we come back to this.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.900]   We come back to the place at which the Protestant fathers found themselves.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.460]   After all those centuries of the tyranny and the error of Rome, they suddenly found here
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.780]   was an authority by which Rome could be judged, they themselves could be judged, everything
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.380]   could be judged.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.820]   It is, as I say, the only ultimate and reliable and infallible authority.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.500]   And we have been looking into the reasons for saying that, its own claims, what our
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.380]   Lord claims for it, the claims of the apostles, and the authority that was recognized in them
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.860]   by the early church, under the influence and the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:47.140]   Very well, we have seen that we must submit to this, and submit utterly to it, without
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.020]   any reservation.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.580]   The moment we begin to sit in judgment on this, we have abandoned our authority, and
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.020]   we are again putting our own reason as the supreme authority.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.060]   We have to accept the Bible as it is.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.300]   We have to accept it in its entirety.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.140]   We have to realize that it is as adequate today as it has ever been.
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.220]   Now, we were dealing with that last Sunday morning, this foolish notion that whereas
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.300]   the Bible was all right in times past, it is no longer adequate in this age of which
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.500]   we are so proud, the atomic age, the scientific age.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.300]   Now I think I was able to demonstrate that to take that view is just to fail completely
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.660]   in one's thinking.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.860]   Because this is truth about God, it is ageless.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.180]   Because it is truth that men by his mind and reason can never arrive at, it is again ageless.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.020]   Because it is truth that is always mediated and brought to us by the operation of the
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.740]   Holy Spirit and that alone, again, it is ageless.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.060]   The idea that we know more about God than the Lord Jesus Christ and the Apostle Paul
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.100]   did because we are living nearly two thousand years after him, is, I think, of all nonsense
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.980]   the greatest.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.300]   Our business is to try, under the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit, to arrive at
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.660]   an understanding of what was revealed to that great Apostle and the other Apostles.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.340]   That is our task.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.980]   And so I say that we have got to submit ourselves utterly and absolutely.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.940]   I quote again that great word of this Apostle Paul, "If any man will have to be wise in
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.780]   this world," says Paul, "let him become a fool, that he may be made wise," by which
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.460]   he means this.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.620]   If you really want to become wise, well, in the eyes of the world, you have got to become
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.940]   a fool.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.580]   In other words, you turn your back on philosophy, all advance and development, all modern cleverness
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.580]   and knowledge.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.580]   You say, "It is irrelevant.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.460]   It does not help me at all."
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.780]   You become a fool and you submit to the authority of this book.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.580]   That is the Apostle's way of becoming a Christian and of growing in grace and in the
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.660]   knowledge of the Lord.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:17.420]   We have got to submit to it utterly and absolutely and regard it as our authority in every respect.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.660]   It is the only position that we can arrive at.
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.380]   And as I say, it has been the position of the Church always in every period of reformation
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.380]   and of revival.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.220]   But I want to go further this morning.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.260]   I want to say that we ought to rejoice in this.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.460]   We ought to glory in the fact that this is the position.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.460]   Why?
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.340]   Well, for this good reason.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:48.980]   If this were not the position, there would be no hope for the average, for the ordinary
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.680]   Church member.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.500]   That is where this position is so completely ridiculous.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:02.220]   If it were man's way, in which it all depends upon our understanding, our reason, our brain
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.740]   power, our ability, well, the Gospel would be the monopoly of a very few people.
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.340]   And the vast majority of people who have not got time or perhaps even the ability to read
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.980]   philosophy and all these wonderful books, they would have nothing at all.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.660]   They would have no knowledge.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.020]   They would just have to sit and listen slavishly to these great people.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.300]   But you see, that is not God's way at all.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.180]   As it is given by the Spirit, as it is all here and unfolded and expanded by the Spirit,
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.620]   there is hope for all.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.140]   So the Apostle is able to say to those Corinthians, "You see, O calling brethren, how not many
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.300]   wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, 'God hath chosen
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.300]   the foolish things.'
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.620]   Thank God."
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.460]   The early Church consisted mainly of slaves and of soldiers and of servants.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.220]   The common people heard him gladly, and there would be no hope for such people were it not
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.140]   that this is God's way.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.620]   It is not only not the monopoly of the wise and the learned, they are about the last people
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.980]   to see it and to come into it because of their pride of intellect.
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.980]   How wonderful is God's way!
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.900]   Yes, as Paul says again, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.900]   us wisdom."
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.580]   Here is wisdom from God, and we ought to rejoice in it.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.660]   What matters this morning is not our brain power primarily, it is not our ability.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.380]   What matters is that we are under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:42.060]   You see, John is able to make that astounding statement in his first epistle, in chapter
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.500]   2, in verses 20 and 27.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.500]   He repeats it.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.820]   He is writing to these early Christians, who, as I say, belong to that group, what would
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.500]   be called the lowest orders of society.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.580]   And he is able to say this without any fear.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.700]   He says, "The antichrists have already started.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.140]   Error was already trying to seep in.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.860]   False doctrine was already being propagated."
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.500]   It is all right, says John, you have that unction from the Holy One, and you know all
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   things.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.140]   And it is a very remarkable thing, this.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:20.700]   It has often been the case that when the great doctors of the Church have all gone astray,
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:28.940]   gone simple, untaught, unlettered people, because they were simple and had a realization
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:35.220]   of their need of the Holy Spirit, have proved to be the guardians and the custodians of
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.220]   the faith.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.540]   Well, now, if we are not clear about this, I say, there is no hope of our ever girding
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.140]   ourselves about with truth.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.140]   This is basic, and we ought to rejoice in it together.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.220]   Well, now, then, having arrived at that point, and it is essential that we should be clear
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.220]   about that.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.980]   If we are not clear about that, well, obviously all I am going to say is going to be quite
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.980]   wrong.
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:04.020]   But we must go further, I say, having said that we have all we need and more than we
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:09.660]   can ever take in in this book, that it is adequate and sufficient for every contingency,
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.780]   every possibility, anything and everything that can ever happen.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.380]   Having emphasized that and laid that down, I go on to say this.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:22.580]   Very well, if it is all here, can I know what it is?
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.580]   Can I discover it?
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.260]   I have got to put on this truth, I have got to gird myself with it.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260]   Can it be defined, therefore?
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.900]   It is not enough to say it is here, but what is it?
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.220]   How can I know what I am doing?
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.500]   Now, here again is the second aspect of the modern difficulty.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.700]   Now, I have no doubt that there are some people in this congregation saying, "Why do you
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.720]   spend all your time with this?
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.700]   I am having a hard struggle in this world, and I want a bit of help and a bit of encouragement.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.060]   I am not concerned about these modern errors and heresies.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.540]   I just want a bit of comfort."
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.500]   Well, my dear friend, if that is your position, you are to be greatly pitied.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.820]   You will soon be in much greater trouble if you continue along that line.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.220]   Not only that, you see, you are entirely unscriptural.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:18.100]   The Apostle Paul, with these slaves and servants and others, nearly 2,000 years ago, 1,900
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.540]   years ago at Inuit, you noticed in addressing the elders of the church at Ephesus how he
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.500]   reminded them of all the time he had spent in warning them.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.020]   It is our business to warn.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.700]   Evil communications corrupt good manners.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.940]   If you are not based solidly upon the truth, you will soon have no comfort at all, and
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.700]   the whole of your life in every respect will go to pieces.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.980]   Whether you like it or not, you need to be instructed, and you must be instructed.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.920]   For myself, I have got to put it like this.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.900]   I have no choice in the matter.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.420]   I am not put here to please men or to entertain or to give people the little bit of comfort
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.980]   they think they need.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.620]   It is the cults that do that.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.820]   I am appointed as a custodian and a guardian of the faith, and I have got to give an account
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.180]   of my stewardship.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:18.860]   And it is because one can see so clearly what is happening at the present time in the church
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:25.420]   and even amongst evangelical people that this becomes of unusual importance and urgency.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:32.220]   There is a grave danger of our slipping away almost entirely from the true faith, caused
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.220]   by what?
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.220]   A spirit of fear.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.660]   They are so afraid of communism and certain big problems that they say, "We must all
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.660]   get together.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.660]   It doesn't matter what we believe.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.700]   All Christians must stand together," not realizing that you can never fight communism
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.660]   or any otherism except by the truth.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.180]   Big battalions can't fight it.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.540]   It is the truth alone that can fight it, and given the truth, it doesn't matter how small
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.540]   the numbers.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.940]   God, the Spirit, will honor it and will bring us to victory.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.920]   Well, I say, here is this confusion.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.780]   We are being told that the truth cannot be defined.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.620]   This is the favorite slogan at the present time.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.260]   Christianity is caught, not taught.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.260]   What do they mean by that?
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.540]   Well, you see, it is this whole mystical idea.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.180]   The Fathers, of course, used to think that the Bible was a sort of textbook full of proof
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:36.180]   texts and that the Bible had got what is called propositional truth, that God had revealed
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.060]   truth to people and had given instructions saying, "This is right and that is wrong."
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.340]   Of course, they say we know by now that that is quite wrong.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.740]   They say that there is no such thing as propositional truth at all.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.900]   Well, what is the value of the Bible to such people?
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.660]   Well, they say, what the Bible really is, is this.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.740]   The Bible, they say, you know, after all, we have just been discovering now.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.420]   It has only just been discovered; it wasn't known before.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.460]   All the centuries have been wrong; it has only just been discovered.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.420]   That the Bible, after all, is nothing but the record of men's spiritual experiences.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:17.460]   That is the popular teaching today, very popular on the continent of Europe, and it always
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:24.620]   comes over here from there, sometimes via America, sometimes directly, but here it is.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.780]   That the Bible is nothing but men attempting to put into words the experience they have
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:35.580]   had of God, this wonderful mystical experience, and here they now try to set it out before
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.580]   us.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.940]   So they say it is of help to us; it is of help to us to check the experiences that we
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:41.940]   have.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.300]   It is nothing more than that.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.700]   You don't go here for propositions.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.220]   You don't find in the Bible exact definitions of truth, saying it is this and it isn't.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.220]   No, no, no.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.940]   It is just some, well, some general test by which you can test yourself.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:05.220]   That is the sort of experience they have, but it is of some value in helping to test
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.220]   your experience.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:11.500]   Now, let me give you one illustration to show you what I mean.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.980]   You remember how the Apostle Paul, in writing to Timothy, second epistle, second chapter
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:22.620]   verse eight, says, "Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, is raised from
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.940]   the dead according to my gospel."
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.300]   I remember reading a sermon by a man on that, and this is how it was interpreted.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.940]   It is so typical of this modern attitude.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:40.780]   His theme was "my gospel," and the sermon consisted of this.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.660]   Are you able to say, "my gospel"?
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.860]   "Ah," he said, "the trouble with the Fathers was they were great theologians.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.000]   They understood doctrine, but they had no experience.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.180]   They hadn't appropriated it.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.220]   It hadn't become living and real to them.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.260]   They couldn't say, 'my gospel.'"
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.580]   This was the theme, the ability to say, "my gospel," purely experimental, you see.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:10.740]   And then, of course, he went on to say this, "Of course," he said, "I say, 'my gospel.'
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.420]   It may not be your gospel, but it doesn't matter.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.140]   Can you say that what you've got is your gospel?
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.380]   Can you say, 'my gospel'?"
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.260]   So here we are, you see, a number of us saying, "my gospel," but contradicting one another
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.580]   completely and entirely.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.940]   But that doesn't matter at all.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.980]   The great thing is that I've got an experience, that I've appropriated something, that I say,
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.980]   "my gospel."
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:38.660]   Well, of course, that's just the exact opposite of what the Apostle Paul was telling Timothy.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.600]   What he was telling Timothy there, as you remember, who will remember that chapter,
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   was this.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.360]   There are some people, he says, who are denying the resurrection.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.140]   They say that it's passed already.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.180]   He says that's a canker, that's a cancer.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:56.680]   The only true gospel, he says, is my gospel, which says that Jesus Christ of the seed of
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.820]   David is raised from the dead.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.700]   But here's a man taking the Apostle's word, twisting them to mean the exact opposite.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.500]   That's so characteristic of what is being done at the present time.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.300]   Now I must keep you with this.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:19.780]   This teaching is rampant, especially, I say, on the continent of Europe, and we must be
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.940]   concerned about our brethren in the Church on the continent of Europe and in other parts
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.940]   of the world.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:30.660]   Now, I don't want to use these technical terms, but you see, the popular teaching now for
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.220]   a number of years, indeed since the end of the First World War, has been this teaching
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.300]   of what is called existentialism.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:42.700]   Don't be frightened of the word, it means this.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:51.400]   Nothing matters except this moment of encounter with God.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   Objective truth.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   No, no.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.660]   It's this moment when I meet God and take a decision, that's the one thing that matters.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.980]   Now, that's what's meant by existentialism.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.960]   It puts its whole emphasis upon experience, upon living, not upon objective truth.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   It is this.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.020]   There's another teaching, a kind of subdivision of it, famous, called the "I-Thou" teaching
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:19.140]   and relationship, propagated by a very learned Jew, who's not a Christian at all, but has
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.780]   almost become the leader of Christian thinking in so many circles today.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.380]   This "I-Thou," this meeting with God, that's what matters.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:34.340]   Different definitions, not doctrine, not dogma, but this vital moment of coming into contact
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.340]   with God.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.420]   Now then, all the Bible does is to tell you how people have had that experience.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.100]   Some describe it like this, some describe it like that.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.820]   So they tell us it's not a bit surprising that the theology of Paul and the theology
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.580]   of John don't agree.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.180]   The theology of John, they say, is the theology always of experience and of love.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:58.620]   That Paul is more doctrinal, more objective, more interested in justification.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.420]   They don't hesitate to say that, that there's a real conflict, obviously, between the detailed
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.300]   teaching of the Apostle Paul and the Apostle John, but it doesn't matter.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.540]   They both have had the existential experience.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.900]   They both have had this mystical experience.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.900]   They both were in the "I-Thou" relationship, but because they were different men with different
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.660]   mentalities and temperaments, the one puts it like this, the other puts it like that.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.140]   That doesn't matter at all.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.980]   Let dozens of others put it in still different ways.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.060]   It's all right, we've all had the same experience.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.540]   So ultimately, you're back on your own experience.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.180]   You've got nothing to test it with.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.380]   You've got no objective truth.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.500]   So I'm saying once more, that if the Bible is just that, if that is the truth concerning
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   the Bible, well then it is more or less useless.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.500]   But this is the teaching.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.340]   Let me give you another illustration.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.740]   You say, "But why are you being so negative?
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.860]   Why don't you teach us positively?"
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.900]   I'll tell you, my friend, it's because I know you.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.100]   "Ah, but you say you don't know me personally."
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.020]   I know I don't, but I know you all the same.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:14.460]   And what I know is this, that you read books, you read articles, you listen to sermons,
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.860]   and the while you listen to television, and you say, "That sounds very nice, that's
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.860]   all right."
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.900]   Yes, and you say that because you're not instructed in this matter, because you're
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.860]   not aware of this subtle teaching that comes in.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:34.860]   Look at it, look at another way in which they put it, it's like this.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.180]   The great thing is they say, "To know Jesus Christ."
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.980]   They say, "No, no, you people are worshipping a book.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.740]   We don't worship a book.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.900]   We worship the Lord.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.900]   Our standard is not the Bible, it's Jesus Christ.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.220]   He's the one.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.740]   And these people have kept you with the book and with their doctrines, and they've kept
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:53.980]   you from the vital thing.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.220]   No, no, we go straight to him.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.180]   He's our only authority.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.000]   Everything is in him."
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.980]   But then, of course, we are entitled to ask them the question, "Well, how do you know
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.980]   him?
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:12.420]   How do you know that what you think you know about him is true?"
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:18.500]   The Bible tells us that we must search the spirits and try them and test them, that there
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.180]   is an evil spirit, there is a spirit of antichrist.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.940]   The history of the Church proves that constantly, how people very honestly and very genuinely
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.580]   have gone seriously astray because they've just trusted to their experience and to their
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.580]   feeling.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.980]   But in any case, how do you know Christ?
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.900]   And this is the answer they give us.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.140]   I'm quoting exactly from a sermon.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.480]   The preacher said, "Look, you know Christ in this way."
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.700]   He said, "I read Treasure Island," Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.700]   And there I come across a character called Long John Silver.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:06.020]   Now, he said, "Having read Treasure Island, I know Long John Silver.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:11.260]   And if you come and tell me," he said, "that Long John Silver was a nice and a kind and
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.860]   a gentle man, I say you're wrong."
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.700]   He says, "I've got to know this man through reading the book.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.780]   I've got a mental image and picture of him.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.780]   I know what he does and what he doesn't do."
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:32.680]   Now he said, "In reading the Gospels, I get to know Jesus in the same way."
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.020]   He said, "I've got a mental image and picture of Jesus."
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.460]   And he says, "I know I'm right."
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:46.780]   So he doesn't hesitate to go on to add this, that when he is told that Jesus made a whip
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:52.700]   out of cogs and drove certain people out of the temple, he doesn't believe it.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:56.100]   He says, "It doesn't fit in with the Jesus I know."
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.100]   That's not true, therefore.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.620]   You take that out of the Gospels.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:06.300]   When you get to Jesus' denunciation of the Pharisees, as recorded in Matthew 23, he says,
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.100]   "I don't believe it."
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.980]   He was incapable of speaking like that.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.900]   When I'm told, he says, that Jesus spoke of a place where their womb doth not and the
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:19.820]   fire is not quenched, I do not believe it.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.340]   My Jesus doesn't say things like that.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.940]   It's impossible for him to.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.260]   He's incapable of doing that, and so on and so forth.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.460]   So you see the position at which we arrive.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.340]   You can't believe your Gospels.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:39.540]   What is true of Jesus is what I think Jesus would do or say, or not do or say.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.100]   It is purely subjective.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.580]   I've got no external authority or standard whatsoever.
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.580]   But it sounds so pious and so wonderful, doesn't it, that I know him.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.420]   Yes, but that's the way in which they know him.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.900]   That's the exact parallel and illustration which is used.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:02.180]   You see, my friends, the importance of being clear about these things.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.460]   Never has the attack of the devil upon the Church been more subtle than perhaps it is
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.860]   at the present time.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.900]   It comes with a great show and display of learning and philosophical terms, existentialism,
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:20.320]   so marvellous, such an advance upon the old method and manner of expounding text and explaining
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   the truth.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.960]   Oh, how specious, how subtle, how devilish it all is.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.460]   Well, very well, then, it brings us back to this.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.180]   That we must be clear as to whether that is true or whether we do accept what the Bible
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.300]   itself says, because here there is no question at all.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:49.460]   The Bible itself teaches us quite plainly that truth can be defined, that truth can
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:56.620]   be known, that it is something with which we can gird our lives, that it doesn't throw
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.380]   it all back onto me and my subjective feeling or understanding, but that I've got propositions
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:07.260]   here, that I've got specific definitions, that the truth is not something vague and
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:14.620]   indefinite and mystical, but is something rather that is reduced to actual propositions
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.180]   and definitions and precise statements.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.060]   Now, that is the claim of the Bible itself for itself and for its truth.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.300]   And, of course, immediately I say, "Thank God."
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.300]   Why?
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.300]   Well, for this reason.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.900]   Well, now I'm beginning to see that I've got something with which I can gird my lives.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.960]   I've got something that I can put on so that when I'm presented by a teaching, I
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   can test it.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.180]   I don't test it merely by whether I think it fits in or not.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:43.540]   No, no, I've got something outside me here to check my own feeling, to check what the
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.340]   other man is saying, to check and to test everything.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.620]   Now, but let me give you my evidence.
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.740]   I don't stand here just to say that I'm asserting this against the existentialists
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.740]   and so on.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.100]   I'm going to give you evidence that the Bible claims this and urges us to believe
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   this.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.380]   Take our Lord himself.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:10.340]   In John 8, 31, 32, you'll read something like this, that he'd been preaching and that
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.780]   at that point certain people believed on him.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:25.740]   "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, 'If ye continue in my word, then
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:34.420]   shall ye be my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   free.'"
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.700]   You see, he talks about something which is the truth.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.940]   Here is something which they're going to get at and to understand and to appropriate
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.460]   as they continue in his word.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.740]   So he refers to it as the truth.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:57.340]   Here is a body of truth which one takes in bits and parts and portions, one is able to
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.740]   assimilate and to understand.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:04.180]   But we've got to continue in his word in order that we might do so.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:09.500]   And of course he says exactly the same thing in the 17th chapter of John's Gospel and
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:17.980]   in the 17th verse, where he prays to his Father and says, "Sanctify them by or through thy
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.980]   truth."
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:25.060]   Thy word is truth, and it isn't a mere mystical word.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.860]   It's the word that's been revealed.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:32.420]   It's Moses, the law, the prophets, this new word that is to be revealed through the Spirit
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.420]   to the apostles.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.420]   Here's the word.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.420]   Sanctify them through that.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:41.900]   Well, in other words, I'm using these quotations in order to prove my point that he keeps on
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.540]   talking about the truth, the word.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:51.060]   It is a body of truth which is to be taught and imparted to others and which we can receive.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:56.340]   But now let us take further evidence, supporting evidence, in our own epistle, this epistle
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.700]   to the Ephesians, which we are considering.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.460]   The apostle here makes it perfectly plain.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.580]   I read last Sunday morning the third chapter of this epistle to the Ephesians in order
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.660]   that I might pick out certain great phrases.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.060]   Here they are.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:15.980]   He says in the second verse of the third chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, "I, Paul,
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:22.900]   the prisoner of Christ Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if you have heard of the dispensation
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.700]   of the grace of God which is given me to you."
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.820]   Now, this dispensation, what's it mean?
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.820]   It means stewardship.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.420]   He's been made a steward.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.300]   Also he tells the Corinthians something similar.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.460]   He says, "We are stewards of the mysteries."
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.220]   Now, when he talks about mystery there, he doesn't mean this vague mystical something
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.060]   that's being talked of today.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:53.060]   The mystery in the Bible is always truth inaccessible to the mind of men but which God has revealed.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.820]   The mystery has been revealed.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:01.420]   And he says, "We apostles, we are stewards, guardians, custodians, and therefore purveyors
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.560]   of the mysteries, this truth."
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:09.200]   But here he calls it a dispensation, a stewardship of the gospel.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   It's a particular message.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.120]   "How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery."
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   There it is.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:20.180]   "In other ages it was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.840]   his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit."
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   What is this?
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.580]   Well, it's a particular truth that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.620]   and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:34.780]   Now that had been hinted at in the Old Testament but they hadn't fully understood it.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.660]   But now it's been made plain and clear so it can be taught.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.260]   And that, you see, is what you find in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.820]   Even Peter stumbled at preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, this idea that a Gentile
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.980]   should become a Christian.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.900]   It seemed all wrong to a Jew.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.700]   Peter again had to have a revelation concerning this.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.020]   He had to have specific instruction that they are to come in.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.340]   Here's a part of this knowledge.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.900]   Well, then take his other great tongue.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.940]   He says, "Later on unto me, one less than the least of all saints, is this grace given
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:13.820]   that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.140]   You see, here it is.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.700]   What do riches consist of?
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.380]   Well, riches are not something vague, indefinite, mystical, and nebulous.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.380]   No, no.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:27.620]   Riches consist of treasures which you can handle, take up this bit, that bit, that bit,
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.260]   and round you go, round a great art gallery.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.020]   It's not some general impression, but particular pictures you're looking at, and each one
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.020]   is giving you something.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.460]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.980]   And so, of course, he prays for them later on, that God may grant them the Spirit, that
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:47.420]   they, being rooted and grounded in love, and you can only do that by teaching, may be able
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.420]   to comprehend and understand with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.620]   height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, and so on.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.940]   Well, now, there it is in chapter 3, but come to chapter 4 of Ephesians, verse 13.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:09.460]   He is talking about the church, and he, unlike the moderns, enters into such details, such
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:16.620]   as saying that God has given some apostles and prophets and evangelists and pastors and
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.620]   teachers.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.500]   You see, these are not just terms; we are to know what they stand for, and we considered
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.740]   them when we were dealing with that chapter.
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.320]   This is detailed knowledge and information.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.140]   This is definition of truth.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.340]   If you don't know what an apostle is, well, you must be in trouble, and you will be in
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.340]   trouble.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.100]   Are there apostles today, for instance?
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.120]   You see, that's the kind of truth the Bible is interested in, not some vague experience.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.460]   But what is an apostle?
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.820]   If I'm built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, I must know what an apostle
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.300]   is and what a prophet is.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.780]   But it's all here for us, if we like to take it, propositional truth.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.620]   Well, then he goes on to say this.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.180]   What's the object of all this teaching?
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:57.260]   Well, he says it's for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.820]   for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:04.740]   That's what I'm called to do, my friends, to edify you.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:10.500]   Not just to send you away with a nice feeling, not just to give a little moral address and
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.540]   to encourage you to go on being good and nice people.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:20.660]   No, no, it's to build you up, edify, to edify the body of Christ.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:28.700]   But for, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:33.620]   of God, and to a perfect man, and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.940]   You see, the apostle's interested in the unity of the faith.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.020]   Today everybody's interested in the unity of the church.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.740]   They're all thinking of an institution, unity of the church.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.020]   The apostle isn't concerned primarily about that.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.380]   What he's interested in is the unity of the faith.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.140]   And where you haven't got this unity of faith, you haven't got a church.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.500]   You've got a conglomeration of people who call themselves Christians, and who may be
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   as far removed, if not further removed, from Christianity than people who make no pretensions
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.500]   at all.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.420]   He talks about the unity of the faith.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.940]   And then take this extraordinary phrase he uses in the twentieth verse of this same fourth
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:11.940]   chapter of Ephesians.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.660]   He says, "But ye have not so learned Christ."
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:20.520]   Christ can be learned, not just experienced vaguely.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.520]   You can learn.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.220]   There are certain things that are true, and are not true.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.900]   He'd been instructing them about this in detail.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.900]   Very well.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.460]   There are some of these illustrations.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.660]   And then, of course, take that mighty and most moving statement, which we have read
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:41.660]   together at the beginning, out of the twentieth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.100]   There it is in a most moving form.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:54.300]   "I have not shunned," he says in verse twenty-seven, "to declare unto you all the counsel of God."
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:34:00.380]   Day and night he'd been teaching and instructing them, and preparing them, and warning them.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.380]   Why?
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.900]   Well, because he knew what was going to happen.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:08.440]   "I commend you to God," he says, "and to the word of his grace, which is able to
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.740]   build you up."
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:15.220]   And you can only be built up by words, by detailed, specific teaching.
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.900]   A nice feeling doesn't build you up.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.740]   It makes you feel happy for the moment, but in the time of crisis you find you've got
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.740]   nothing at all.
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:25.740]   You've lost your feeling, or indeed if you wake up tomorrow morning without it, you've
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.740]   got nothing.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:30.940]   There's only one thing that can build us up, and that is the word of his grace, which
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:36.700]   is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:41.540]   Read again that moving passage in Acts twenty, beginning at verse seventeen, and go on to
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.540]   the end.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:47.980]   And you'll find that the Apostle keeps on using terms which show that of necessity the
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.260]   truth can be defined.
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.380]   He says, "This is truth.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.300]   Now certain people are going to come who are going to say something else.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   Don't believe them.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.620]   They're wolves in sheep's clothing.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.620]   They're liars.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.620]   They're wrong.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:04.300]   I warn you now," says Paul, "that's Christianity."
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.700]   But it's not popular Christianity today, alas.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.220]   And that's why the Church is as she is, and why the world is as it is.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.020]   But listen to supporting evidence from the great Apostle.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.700]   I want to establish this beyond any doubter peradventure.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:25.260]   Look at him in 1 Corinthians 15, "I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received."
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.260]   He delivered something.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.260]   And what was it?
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:34.940]   He tells us how that Christ died according to the Scriptures, buried according to the
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.340]   Scriptures, rose again according to the Scriptures.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.860]   It's all detailed teaching.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.060]   And of course, that's his whole argument in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.300]   There were people even then.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.360]   There's nothing new in the twentieth century.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.400]   The twentieth century will go down in history, if there will be history after it, as the
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.380]   century which resurrected all the heresies of the first century.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.820]   That's all that's happening.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.900]   What's the argument in 1 Corinthians 15?
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.900]   Just this.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:12.140]   There were clever people who were saying, "There's no future resurrection of the body.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.140]   Resurrection is past already."
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:18.140]   They say, "It doesn't matter whether Christ literally rose in the body from the grave
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   or not.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.780]   The great thing is that his influence is still here.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.980]   We can still have mystical experiences of him."
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.580]   Look, here says Paul, "If you're saying that, you're denying the whole Gospel.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.360]   My preaching is vain, your faith is vain, you are yet in your sins."
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:39.140]   It's as important as that—detailed, particular, propositional truth.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:45.500]   He's concerned about it, and he's fighting for it with all his great powers.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:52.260]   Then you get the same thing in that wonderful, rousing exhortation in 1 Corinthians 16, 13.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.340]   "Stand fast in the faith."
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.820]   You can't stand fast in a cloud, can you?
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.020]   You can't stand fast on a feeling.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.980]   "Stand fast in the faith."
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.980]   It's a rock.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.020]   It's a solid foundation.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:18.580]   But then, think of the extraordinary things he says to the Galatians, Galatians 1, 6.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:24.520]   "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you unto the grace of Christ,
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.760]   unto another gospel."
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.860]   Another gospel, which is not another.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:31.860]   Listen to him.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.540]   Here's Paul's Christianity, propositional.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.780]   You can say, "This is the gospel, that is not the gospel."
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.060]   "Ah, but you're being narrow, you're being critical, you're not being cooperative."
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.900]   That's what you'd have been told today.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.660]   The Apostle Paul would be abominated by the modern Church.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:52.940]   They dismiss him as just an arrogant, opinionated man who thinks that he alone is right and
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.860]   stands on his own against everybody.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.540]   But here he is.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.420]   Where do you stand, my friends?
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.260]   Do you know what the gospel is?
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.580]   Are you ready to say about other teachings that they're not the gospel, but that they're
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.580]   lies?
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:13.460]   "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.420]   we have preached, let him be accursed."
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.580]   That's how this great apostle writes.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.060]   Listen to him in Galatians 5.4.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.940]   He says, "If you go back to circumcision and things like that, Christ is become of
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:32.300]   no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.460]   You are fallen from grace."
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.660]   Now, when he says that, he's not referring to an experience.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.100]   What he's referring to is this.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:46.540]   He says, "If you teach that, you have abandoned a belief in grace.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.380]   You've gone back to a belief in the law.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:53.580]   To fall from grace here simply means that you fall from the teaching about grace, the
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:39:01.980]   grace position, the grace understanding of truth, to a legal, Jewish, Judaistic understanding
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   of truth."
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.380]   He doesn't hesitate to say that.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.900]   In other words, it can be defined.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.940]   He couldn't make a statement like that unless he'd got some objective test and standards,
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.940]   and he does say that.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:16.460]   He says, "If you bring back circumcision, you've wrecked the gospel of grace."
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.580]   But today, he'd been told, "This is nonsense.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.860]   Let them bring in circumcision.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.740]   Let them bring in anything they like.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.040]   Let them bring in all the corruption of Rome.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.740]   It doesn't matter as long as they talk about Christ."
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.980]   Not so with this man.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:35.380]   To bring in one thing only, circumcision, has meant that the gospel of grace is gone.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.780]   You've fallen away from it.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:37.780]   It's no longer left.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.940]   You're trying to justify yourself by works.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.620]   But listen to him again in writing in his own loving way to the Philippians.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.620]   Listen to this.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.860]   In Philippians 1.7, this is where we all come in, "Even as it is meet for me to think
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:56.180]   this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds and in
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:03.260]   the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partakers of my grace."
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:08.340]   The Philippian church, the members of the Philippian church, were with him in the defense
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.420]   of the gospel, in the confirmation of the gospel.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.500]   Are you in it, my friend?
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.580]   Are you defending the gospel today, or are you saying, "It doesn't matter what you
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.900]   believe as long as you've got some experience.
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:25.580]   You are called with me to defend the gospel and to confirm its truth and to confirm people
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.580]   in it."
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:31.380]   But listen to him saying the same thing in verses 27 and 28 of that first chapter of
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.480]   the epistle to the Philippians, "Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.980]   of Christ, that whether I come and see you or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:48.740]   that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the faith of the
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:55.260]   gospel, striving together for it, and in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.740]   them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation and that of God."
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:00.740]   Are we of one mind?
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.700]   Are we striving for this, or are we saying, "Ah, but you mustn't strive.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.440]   That causes division.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.200]   We must all be nice, and these people, after all, are Christians."
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   No, no.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:15.600]   You've got to strive with one mind for the faith of the gospel, says the great apostle.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.000]   And let me give you my final quotations.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.440]   There it is, of course, very perfectly in 2 Timothy 1, 13 and 14.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:33.240]   "Hold fast," he says, "hold fast the form of sound words, sound words which thou hast
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:39.400]   heard of me in faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus, that good thing which was committed
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.120]   unto thee, keep by the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us."
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.800]   Now, you're familiar with the fact that the true translation here is "the deposit."
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.920]   He says, "that deposit which was committed unto you, keep."
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:01.520]   Yes, and this deposit, you see, it's a form of sound words, but I do like that word "deposit."
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.240]   Something has been given to him, the deposit, the truth, the repository of the truth, the
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.800]   scriptures and the teaching of the apostles.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.280]   So he goes on in the second chapter to put it like this, in verses 1 and 2.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:20.160]   "Thou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and the things
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:26.920]   that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:32.400]   be able to teach others also, the things, the words, the particular teaching, the definitions,
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.400]   the doctrines.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.920]   Here is what is meant by the truth with which we are to guard ourselves."
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:45.040]   And so he goes on, as I've already reminded you, in verse 8 to speak of my gospel.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.520]   But this is not something that is confined to the Apostle Paul.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.840]   The Apostle Peter says exactly the same thing, 2 Peter 1, 12 and following.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.520]   "Wherefore," says Peter, "I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.320]   of these things, though you know them."
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.960]   That's what I'm doing this morning.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.320]   I'm reminding you of things you know, but because we don't have them in the front of
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.880]   our minds, in the end we don't seem to know them.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.880]   I'm reminding you of what you know.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.840]   "Though ye know them and be established in the present truth.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.840]   Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.520]   in remembrance, knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.920]   Even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.640]   Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   in remembrance."
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   These things.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.240]   Not some vague, nice feeling.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.920]   Not some bit of idealism.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.880]   Not just an exhortation to live a better life and to be moral.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.880]   These things.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.880]   What are they?
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.880]   "Well," he says, "these things are not cunningly devised fables.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:53.980]   We have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.000]   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his glory."
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.900]   And he goes on to describe what he means.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.760]   Now there it is again in exactly the same way.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   Particular teaching.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.200]   And of course Jude is very explicit in this respect.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   The third verse.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.560]   "Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.860]   for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:30.160]   faith, the faith, this truth, which was once and forever delivered unto the saints."
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.800]   Contend for the faith.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.160]   And you can't do that unless you know what it is.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.920]   And John, of course, in exactly the same way, teaches precisely the same truth.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.680]   Here it is in the first chapter of his first epistle.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.120]   "That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that he also may have fellowship
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:51.360]   with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.240]   These things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:03.440]   This then is the message, the message, that we have heard of him and declare unto you.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.400]   And then he goes on to tell them something about it.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.800]   Now it is with that message that they are to measure and test the antichrists that have
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.400]   already come.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:17.160]   And if they don't know this message in detail, they'll never be able to test the detailed
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.720]   teaching of these antichrists.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.360]   Well, there it is.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:29.040]   I have taken you through this mighty evidence that is found in such profusion here in the
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.440]   pages of the New Testament itself.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:42.080]   Thank God, I say, that the truth can be defined, and that I am not just left this morning with
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:48.400]   my feeling or impression as to what Jesus is like or what Jesus would say or what Jesus
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.400]   would do.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:55.840]   Thank God I'm not left there on the shifting sand of my experience and my understanding.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:05.140]   Thank God I've got truth stated clearly, defined, delimited, contrasted with error,
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:11.280]   that I've got warnings and rebukes, expositions of error, as well as the delineation of the
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.280]   truth.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:20.640]   Thank God that as I'm called upon and exalted to gird about my loins with the truth, I can
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:26.560]   now see that it is something which is possible, that I can know whether I'm doing so, whether
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.920]   I'm not doing so.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.200]   In other words, there is a deposit.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:39.600]   And God willing, I'll try to remind you of the essence of that deposit next Sunday
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   morning.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:50.760]   Now shall we join in singing together the hymn number 227, "Father of mercies, in thy
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:47:11.720]   word what endless glory shines, forever be thy name adored for these celestial lines."
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:41.600]   Father of mercies, in thy word what endless glory shines, forever be thy name adored
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:46.480]   for these celestial lines.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.140]   O Lord, hear our prayer.
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:59.880]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless before
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:07.680]   the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:13.440]   and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:21.440]   And may grace, mercy and peace from God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:28.200]   abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain,
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:36.920]   troubled life, and until we shall be with him in the glory everlasting.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.560]   Amen.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
