[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   All right, next question is from Sambit.
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.320]   I have a strange relationship with books.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.280]   I buy a lot of them, but I can't read them.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.160]   After the first 10 to 12 pages, I feel bored and I stop reading.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.440]   I can, however, listen to long podcasts with full attention.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.960]   How do I become a reader?
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.320]   Well, Sambit, the key thing is you have an ambition
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.560]   to become a reader.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320]   So let's give that a checkmark.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.480]   The second thing I want to point out here is you have inadvertently
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.280]   provided us, I think, a really good case study of one
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.640]   of the big ideas from the deep dive earlier in this episode.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.480]   You can listen to long podcasts, no problem.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.320]   But you're having trouble with books.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.680]   That just emphasizes in my mind the exceptional nature of book
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.720]   reading when it comes to all cognitive consumption activities.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.640]   I mean, podcasts are complicated.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.560]   It's not like you can't pay attention to something.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.240]   You're able to focus on a podcast.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.920]   You're able to listen to me and what I'm saying.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.600]   So it just goes to show you that there is a unique, complicated,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.280]   but ultimately essential cognitive dance that
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.120]   happens when you're grappling with sentences written
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.520]   on the physical printed page.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.840]   So it's a good case study that you're providing us here.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.720]   All right, so what you need to do is train.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480]   I don't want you to despair.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.120]   You're not-- there's no such thing as I'm not a reader.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.600]   I am a reader.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.680]   There is I have trained to read or I haven't.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.360]   And if you haven't, how do you fix that?
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.240]   You do the training.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.440]   It's just like I wouldn't say I'm not a runner because I just
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.280]   tried to run a 5K, having never jogged in my life,
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.480]   and didn't go very well.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.400]   I would say I am not in shape to run a 5K.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.480]   But I'm sure if I train within a few months,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.120]   I could run these on a regular basis.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.600]   So I'm going to give you a training regime, Sam,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.520]   that I'm going to suggest about how you become a better reader.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.400]   All right, so we're going to start with books
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.760]   that you are excited to read.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.920]   So we want to take out of the equation early on the boredom
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.960]   factor or the comfort with intellectual discomfort.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.800]   So this could be genre fiction.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.880]   That's really exciting.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.040]   You might even want to start with short stories.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.520]   I recently read Ted Chiang's original short story
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.960]   collection of sci-fi short stories.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960]   It was excellent, right?
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.720]   But they're 20 pages each.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.480]   They're really gripping, whatever.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.720]   So it could be genre fiction or it could be nonfiction.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.120]   Maybe pragmatic nonfiction, like the type of books I write.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.640]   Like, yeah, I want to read digital minimalism
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.280]   because I'm really motivated to spend less time on my phone.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.640]   And so you're motivated.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.040]   I'll read Atomic Habits or memoirs.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.800]   I'll read Goggins' memoir because I want to get fired up
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.720]   or get some discipline.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.360]   So start with books you're excited to read.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.920]   Forget about what they are right now.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   It's just about time on page.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.280]   Number two, find a cool reading location or ritual.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.640]   I talked about in the deep dive.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.280]   It's going to help you here.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.520]   Go into the coffee shop.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   20 minutes while I finish this one cup of coffee,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.240]   I'm going to the pub.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.280]   Bring in the book with me.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.720]   If you go to a pub, it has to be an English-style pub.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.800]   And you need to wear a scarf or an ascot.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.080]   You got to use your accent.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.280]   And you got to use an accent.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.800]   You got to come in with an ascot, preferably a beret.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.240]   If you're going to wear a shirt, it
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.840]   should be striped like a French sailor.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.560]   And you need to say, good day, barkeep.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.600]   A pint of ale while I peruse my book by David Goggins.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.560]   Talk like that.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.120]   And they're like, look, this is like a member
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.240]   of the lost generation.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.680]   Essentially, we have Steinbeck here.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.720]   All right.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.920]   Then I'm going to say-- so that's the setup.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.360]   Scheduled interval training.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.040]   Five days a week, you're going to read 10 minutes at a time.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.680]   Do that for at least two weeks, then up at the 15 minutes.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.360]   Do that for at least two weeks, up at the 20 minutes.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.800]   If you're giving your mind support--
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.160]   I'm excited about the book.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.960]   I have an awesome accent in a bar somewhere.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.120]   Everyone just thinks I'm awesome.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.440]   You're fighting the secretly beautiful but kind
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.480]   of nerdish women because they have the glasses on.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.360]   When you take off the glasses, they're
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.160]   actually models that are just so attracted to the fact
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.760]   that you're clearly a serious intellectual
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.560]   because you're ascot and you're reading in the pub.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.440]   You're fighting off women as you're trying to read.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.040]   So you've given yourself-- you've set it all up.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.480]   And now you're doing a very reasonable amount of time.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.520]   10 minutes at a time.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.200]   You do it for two weeks.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.120]   You can go up to 15 minutes.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.080]   You're just pushing your mind's comfort actually
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.000]   reading beyond a few pages.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.320]   And then once you get to 40 minutes, stop upping your time.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.480]   Fix that as the time you're going to read four to five days
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.240]   a week.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.740]   And what you're going to start upping
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.000]   is the complexity of your books.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.680]   So you get really comfortable at reading
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.440]   most days for 40 minutes.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.400]   And then you start upping the complexity.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.640]   Slightly harder books, slightly more challenging books.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.280]   And you sort of push yourself up the ladder.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.000]   So maybe be a year or two of this,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.580]   you can get to the point where you're
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.720]   ready to actually tackle classic books, really
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.400]   complicated books, books that require secondary sources.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.280]   I'm going to read the secondary source first.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.920]   Then I'm going to read the book.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.520]   I'm telling you, one year, Sambit.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.240]   You're going to be a reader.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.160]   You just got to train.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.640]   Now, why you have to do training, more training
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.720]   than other people is other people just inadvertently
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.080]   or through whatever circumstance or through inclination
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.120]   or how they were raised just got more of this training already.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.320]   So they've already done the training.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.880]   They grew up with a family of athletes.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.040]   They ran every day.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.800]   Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad in Austria
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.160]   made him do push-ups before he could get a meal.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.120]   He had an advantage.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.200]   By the time he got to the military
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.000]   and started bodybuilding, he was around it.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.400]   OK, you didn't have Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad making
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.240]   you do push-ups in the cognitive realm.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.160]   So you got a little more training to do.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.080]   It'll take you a year.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.400]   You'll catch up.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.560]   Actually, you don't want Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.520]   Actually, his autobiography is good.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.160]   Fantastic.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.840]   I listened to it, but I love that.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.160]   It's such a great autobiography.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.080]   But his dad was from a generation of Austrian men
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.920]   who post-World War II were just depressed alcoholics,
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.800]   just trying to grapple with--
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.120]   it's not like he was a member of the Nazi party or something,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.160]   but they were all sort of complicit in what was going on.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.480]   And it just was so--
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.200]   it was just a destroyed generation of men.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.960]   So advantage of Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.680]   extra push-ups, disadvantage, depressed alcoholic,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.040]   sort of Nazi collaborator dad.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.320]   So I would say you could probably just figure out
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.640]   a push-up routine on your own.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.360]   All right, that's kind of going so far.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.800]   It is a really cool biography.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   You know what I like about that book is I love the fact
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.760]   that Schwarzenegger comes over here in weightlifting
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.920]   and basically becomes a millionaire before he really
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.800]   gets in the movies by just--
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.000]   he builds-- he does these businesses other people don't
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.760]   want to do, like Brick Lane and stuff like this,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.160]   invest money in real estate in--
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.840]   not Santa Monica.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.320]   Where was he investing?
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.480]   Venice Beach, I think.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.400]   Yeah, investing in real estate by the beach,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.280]   just doing hard work.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.160]   He had a mail order business.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.120]   Yeah, he built up a fortune and then was like,
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.760]   oh, I'm going to get in the movies.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.840]   So your answer to Sambit reminded me
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.120]   a couple of things about location.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.040]   I went to the Library of Congress a couple of weeks ago.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.720]   My friend gave me a tour, and that was pretty inspiring.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.600]   It's expired.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.080]   I told Jesse I have a researcher card there,
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.640]   just because I like to go and work.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.300]   You know where I would work when I go to the Library of Congress
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.240]   was not the big room with the desks that
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.480]   are all in a circle, but in the arts and industry library.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.880]   It's pretty cool because it has these 1920s art deco light
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.600]   fixtures, and it's a cool place.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.600]   I told Jesse that I got to find a way
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   to write a book at some point soon that requires me
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.200]   to access the collection at the Library of Congress
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.800]   just so I can spend days in that massive reading room
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.640]   and have people bring me-- because if you're an academic,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.240]   you can get a researcher card, and they'll just
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.840]   have this awesome collection.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.320]   And it takes them a couple hours,
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.080]   but you can basically get any book you want,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.880]   and they'll bring them all to you in a cart to your desk,
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.440]   and you can work on it all day.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.000]   And so I need a reason to do that.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.440]   The other thing I do, thanks to you,
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.160]   is I put on my weekly plan every week just some of the stuff
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.760]   I want to get through, because I get a lot of magazines,
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.560]   and I have different books.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.840]   You put reading on your weekly plan.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.340]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.000]   Specific though.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.840]   And then if I have a pile of New Yorkers,
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.680]   I'll just get through a couple of them.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.080]   So you might put Thursday afternoon,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.760]   I'm going to do some New Yorker reading.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.000]   So I put what I want on, and then when I do my daily plan,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.720]   I just put it in there.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.440]   I'm going to read this.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.040]   That's nice.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.960]   You have a queue of what you want to read that week.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.240]   When you're doing daily plans--
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.280]   Otherwise, I couldn't keep track of it,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.760]   and I'd forget about certain things.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.680]   So now I just kind of--
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.520]   I like that strategy.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.520]   So it's like, here's my reading queue for the week.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.560]   And when you're doing a daily plan,
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.160]   you're used to putting aside time for reading.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.920]   But now you can actually pull something from that queue
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.520]   and say, this specifically is what I'm going to read.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.640]   Yeah, it's been working out.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960]   And the other thing that I do, too,
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.920]   is especially after going to Library of Congress
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.240]   and looking online and stuff, it's
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.600]   like, you just got to be comfortable knowing that you're
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.800]   never going to read everything.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   There's so much stuff.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.400]   And you just get through what you can,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.720]   just kind of what you talk about, and it's slow.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.040]   I'm surprised by how often--
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.920]   I'm a big library guy.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.240]   We're a personal library person, and the next question
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.560]   I was going to get at this, I'm surprised by how often
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.840]   I'll get a book.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.520]   Like, I just finished a book last night
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.200]   that I originally bought five years ago.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.400]   But I kept it in my library.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.320]   It's like, this is a book I want to read.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.920]   And sometimes you have to wait till you're in the right mood.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.480]   And it took five years.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.920]   And I read it, and I finished it last night.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.280]   And I'm surprised by how often that-- this is why I love
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.360]   libraries-- how often that'll happen.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.600]   Sometimes I'll buy a book, and I'm not going to read this
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.960]   right now, but I want to own this,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.880]   and I think I'm going to read this.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.400]   I think it's an important thing to have.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.320]   I get to these things.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.760]   And it can take me years, but I cycle back to things.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.400]   (upbeat music)
