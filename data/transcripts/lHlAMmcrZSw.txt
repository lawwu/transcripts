[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The use of Yahweh, I know it's one of the distinctive points of
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.480]   the LSB and maybe a lot of people would note that as
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.840]   something that's like a hallmark point but I think it's
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.640]   more than just a factual thing to note.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.120]   For me reading the name Yahweh, God's personal covenant name,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.240]   for instance in Psalm 23, I grew up memorizing it, "The Lord is
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.160]   my shepherd, I shall not want" and everything about it is true
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.480]   there's nothing taken away by using the word Lord, just
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.760]   reading it where it says, "Yahweh is my shepherd, I shall
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.680]   not want" but there's something about being able to know God's
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.880]   personal name.
