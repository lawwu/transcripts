[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   And the big conversation on social media is you know,
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.120]   who's the best players in the league, who's top five.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.120]   But no one ever hears from, you know,
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.400]   I think right now probably you are the undisputed
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.320]   best player in the world.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.960]   So excluding yourself, who would you say
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.840]   you think it right now in the league is top five?
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.840]   (sighs)
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.200]   It's tough, there's a lot of talent in the league right now.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.520]   - I think I'm gonna say Dwell, Luca.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.320]   I mean, you gotta put KD and LeBron there,
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.480]   so even they're a little bit older,
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.280]   but I think they can still perform.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.080]   - You still got like Steph, you still got--
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.120]   - Steph, you know, I think it's so,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.840]   the talent, and then you have Tatum and--
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.680]   - Giannis.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.720]   - Yeah, you know, it's--
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.560]   - You can't really say a top five.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.600]   - I think it's really impossible to say.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.360]   I think maybe he likes some other player
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.800]   more than some other player, like his game or whatever,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   but I think it's really hard to put that top five
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.960]   or even top 10, to be honest.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.800]   I think it's--
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.340]   Even at night, guys can kind of float.
