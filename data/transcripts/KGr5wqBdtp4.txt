[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:13.520]   Peter writes and asks this, "Pastor John, is the statement, 'God is most glorified in me when I am most satisfied in him,' a
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.200]   universal statement or meant only for believers?
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.360]   For those who are judged, is there a different way to say it that God is most glorified in them through His judgment
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.440]   upon them? In other words, what is the flip side of the positive side of your famous statement?"
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.700]   This is a crucial clarification that needs to be made. So thank you for the opportunity.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.040]   Yes, I love to say God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.760]   God, in Him.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.080]   Which naturally raises the question,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.300]   do I think God is less glorified
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.320]   in people who don't even believe in Him
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.160]   and thus find no satisfaction in Him at all? Which is really another way of asking,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.280]   is God less glorious because evil exists?
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.320]   Is He less glorious because unbelief exists? Because judgment in hell exists? And my
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.040]   statement also raises the question whether God is less glorious if I have a low season
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.040]   of joy
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.440]   in Him. So let me start with that last question.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.120]   When I say God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him, I mean
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.480]   in the act of enjoying God,
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.720]   we make God look more glorious in that moment, in that act, than we would if we were bored with Him or
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.800]   hostile to Him. That's what I mean.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.000]   An enjoyed treasure is an honored treasure. A neglected treasure
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.800]   is a dishonored treasure. That's what I mean. So I am talking about any given moment in the life of a
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.720]   believer. God commands us to glorify Him all the time in all that we do. First Corinthians 10 31,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   620.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.540]   So at any given moment, the question arises, am I, by my thoughts, my feelings, my bodily actions,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.480]   showing God to be the treasure that He is or not?
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.680]   That's what I think it means to glorify God, show Him to be the treasure that He is. The point of my little saying
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.240]   is simple and limited.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.400]   In our reckoning of whether we are showing God to be our supreme treasure,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.080]   one key issue, not the only one, one key issue is whether we are satisfied in Him at that moment. If other things in that
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.180]   moment are more satisfying than God, then we're not making God look supremely valuable and supremely satisfying.
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.360]   So in that moment, God is not most glorified in us. That's what I mean by it. It is a
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.060]   pervasively relevant question
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.780]   because it is a valid question at any moment and has to do with our ultimate calling at every moment to glorify
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.880]   God in those moments and make Him look supremely valuable. And not only is it pervasively relevant,
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.260]   this point in this question, but it is for many people and some theological traditions
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.560]   shocking and threatening because it says
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.500]   your emotions, your spiritual affections,
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.440]   and those spiritual affections are real emotions, though they're
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.960]   never merely worldly emotions since they're aroused by the Holy Spirit, they're always crucial in obedience.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.180]   There's a lot of traditions and a lot of people don't like that thought that our emotions are crucial
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.780]   in glorifying God in any given moment in obedience
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.680]   to God.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.280]   You can't obey the command to glorify God fully
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.520]   if your emotions towards God are non-existent for Him or unengaged in Him
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.280]   or less than they are for other things. You can't.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.400]   That's the point of that statement.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.080]   But even though my little statement that God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in Him is
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.940]   pervasively relevant and
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.360]   valid in every moment and is shocking and threatening to some, it is only one
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.180]   important question to ask about how God is glorified.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.240]   That's why the question we're addressing here
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.040]   is so important. So in answer to the question, "Is God
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.840]   less glorious if I have low seasons of joy in Him?" the answer is no, He's not.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.560]   His glory does not rise and fall
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   as my effectiveness in showing Him glorious rises and falls.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.360]   He remains glorious in my low seasons and my high seasons, and though I don't show His glory
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.760]   as clearly as I should
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.160]   in those low seasons,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.480]   even those seasons
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.880]   will be used by God's
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.360]   overall scheme
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.920]   to show Himself in other ways
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.720]   more glorious, though I may lose some of the pleasure of being a part of those ways.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.360]   Now, I would say the same thing about that other question. Is God less glorious because evil exists?
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.680]   Is He less glorious because unbelief exists or because judgment or hell exists?
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.560]   No, Satan and his devils and his people cannot hold God hostage
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.880]   and rob Him of His glory as they rebel.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   They can't successfully say, as they are thrown into the lake of fire, "Ha!
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.080]   At least we robbed you of your glory by not being satisfied in you
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.620]   and not making you look like a supreme treasure."
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.520]   The word "hallelujah"
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.680]   occurs in the New Testament four times,
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.420]   all of them in Revelation 19, 1-6.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.800]   And what is God being praised for there? I'll read it.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.000]   "After this, I heard what seemed to be a loud voice
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.280]   of a great multitude in heaven." That's us
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.920]   crying out, "Hallelujah!
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.700]   Salvation and glory
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.400]   and power
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.480]   belong to our God, for His judgments are true
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:42.820]   and just, for He has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:49.280]   and has avenged on her the blood of His servants." Once more they cried,
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.820]   "Hallelujah! The smoke of her goes up forever and ever."
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.460]   The prostitute represents Babylon,
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.780]   the archetypal city of unbelief and hostility to God.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.900]   And one thing is clear here,
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.700]   such opposition from Satan
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.020]   and from men
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.840]   will not result in everlasting
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.160]   frustration in heaven,
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.220]   but is an everlasting praise.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.300]   Not because sin is praiseworthy, but because God's response to it is
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.300]   truth
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.880]   and justice.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.260]   "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.900]   His judgments are
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.340]   true
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.320]   and just, for He has judged the great prostitute."
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:52.140]   So, is God less glorious because evil exists? Is He less glorious because unbelief exists?
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.220]   Is He less glorious because judgment and hell exist? The answer is
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.940]   no. As Psalm
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.940]   76 10 says,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.940]   "Surely the wrath of man
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.660]   will praise you."
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:13.900]   Thank you, Pastor John. And on a related note of our emotions and God's glory, see episode number 30 in this podcast series.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:20.060]   And as you probably picked up in this conversation, our emotions are crucial for our obedience to God.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.060]   And if this is news to you, check out a little four-minute video we created
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.900]   that explains this point. Go to DesiringGod.org and click on the "About Us" tab at the top of the page,
