[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   So we got a question from Michael. He's a 41 41 year old engineer from the UK. This is what he has to say
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:14.060]   I have worked hard to clarify ideas outside of my work that feel important to me. However, I still struggle for example
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.900]   Creating a garden is something I've always envisioned in my life for a long time
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.420]   But now that I'm doing it, it feels like endless drudgery labor and effort
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.600]   However, I've sunk so much effort and expense into getting here. I cannot just reset and walk away
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.000]   Is it normal to find conflict between one's cultivation of a deep life on paper and how it actually happens in the real world?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.680]   That's an interesting question
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.560]   Let me give you a short answer in a long answer Michael. The short answer is stop gardening. I
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.760]   Won't tell anyone Jesse won't tell anyone
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.420]   You don't like it and I get it
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.880]   Like here in DC. Here's what I've learned
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.920]   It's often the season in which you'd be maintaining a garden or a yard
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.800]   It's often terrible outside and it's not that fun
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.540]   Because the humidity is roughly
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.920]   Whatever it is, I don't know how to measure humidity. I guess dew point the humidity is terrible. You're in a swamp. It's hot
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.420]   There's bugs and there's mosquitoes and you know, this is why God invented air conditioning. So I'm stop garden. You don't like it
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.880]   long answer
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.880]   and we talked about this last week to
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.360]   be wary about a
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   Mental conception of the deep life that is too heavily focused on hobbies
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.640]   That is not going to be a successful recipe if all you think about is
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.500]   What do I do outside of work in terms of my leisure time? What's going to be like interesting and fulfilling to me?
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.560]   It's too self-focused
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.480]   That stuff matters, but it cannot be central to your conception of the deep life
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.360]   If you go back and think about the deep life bucket, so we're talking about craft
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.440]   community
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.440]   constitution contemplation and celebration
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.600]   what you talk about as hobbies is maybe just in
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:05.080]   Celebration. I mean, I don't know if you acted the Constitution maybe like there's some exercise you do that could be hobbyist sometimes in craft
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.280]   There could be something like you're really into an instrument. You might put that on their craft, but most of the deep life is more about
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.720]   Keeping your body in shape serving your community
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.240]   Engaging your brain in the world of ideas and philosophy and theology so that you can be a moral
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.760]   intellectual being so that you can follow
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.040]   Aristotle's theory that it is in deep thought that humans reach their
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.520]   Deepest potential it's craft. Okay. I'm spending my 80,000 hours in my life in a job
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.160]   Like what am I doing? Am I producing things of value?
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   Am I am I a leader to other people and my a useful member my community a lot of that is not
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.800]   What's gonna make me, you know entertain me?
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.600]   What's going to be something that's kind of fun to do
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.040]   And so if you really go through those buckets one by one, the reason why this works is that the human brain is not
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.080]   So happy if all it thinks about is how do I make myself happy?
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.160]   You know, how do I be happy in the moment? Like that's important in
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.320]   moderation, but basically the history of ideas tells us that just the hedonic pursuit of
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.140]   What's going to be fun doesn't work as an organizing principle for life
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.640]   So when celebration is just this one part like having things you really enjoy doing then it's the stakes are lower
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.480]   You know
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.440]   You're doing other things that sacrifice and service and important and you're gonna be a lot more confident and fulfilled
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.160]   And then when it comes to that, let's say celebration bucket where it's like appreciating the things that makes life cool having gratitude
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.900]   Then I'm just going to suggest have a more experimental approach
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.760]   Don't dive in fully into something that you hope will be something you really like because you might not
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.360]   So garden, I don't know
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.640]   Let me get a garden box and see if I like that minimal impact if I really like it expand out with that bucket
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.740]   Larger and larger people who have these big all-consuming hobbies usually work their way incrementally. You have to discover what's the right fit for you
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.580]   So just don't go into it. Don't just say like I want to be a cinephile. I think that'd be cool
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.300]   I'm gonna sign up for this film course and start watching all these movies. You might not actually like movies that much
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.120]   you're right, but instead if you're like, I've always liked movies and
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.340]   I've started to study them a little more and I'm enjoying that
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.500]   So now let me ratchet up to like go watch this series at the local theater now
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.480]   I'm gonna sign up for this film class when things ratchet up in terms of self-directed autonomous non-instrumental hobbies
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.780]   That's how you figure out what you really like. Okay, so stop gardening. You don't like that experiment with other things
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.500]   but remember
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.740]   that is just one small piece out of many on what goes into making a deep life and most of what makes a deep life deep
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.780]   As much less about what is gonna make me happy tomorrow and more about what's gonna make my life feel more grounded
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.780]   What's gonna make my life feel more?
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.420]   centered and meaningful and important and that's a very different than
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.180]   enjoying pruning your roses
