[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   You made some comments a few months ago that you're not quite sure what to think about that IBM investment.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.840]   Well, I'm not sure how it's going to come out, but of course I like the fact they're doing it.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.640]   And any kind of artificial intelligence is very much in the bulk. It may well work.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.320]   It's just I have no way of predicting. I don't think we're paying much for the opportunity.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.640]   The opportunity to be in shares of IBM?
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.760]   I think that there's not much optimism baked into the current price of the shares.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.120]   What is it that you like about the artificial intelligence there?
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.320]   Well, I like the idea of using artificial intelligence because we're so short of the real thing.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.480]   [Laughter]
