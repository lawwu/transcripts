[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.980]   God is sovereign and whatever difficulties you are going through,
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.140]   whatever issues you face in life, they are within the framework of the mighty hand of God.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.240]   This is an illustration to you and me to humble yourself and let God glorify you
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.020]   and to glorify yourself and cause him to humble you.
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.320]   Because when God glorifies you, he takes you to places that are unimaginable.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.100]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:37.620]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.860]   Amen.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:58.820]   Open your Bible to Philippians.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.840]   Philippians chapter 2, and I want to read the first 11 verses before we look at the last part of this section.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.340]   And I'll translate it as we have indicated it should be translated for us to understand.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.360]   Because there is encouragement in Christ, because there is consolation of love,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.280]   because there is fellowship of the Spirit, because there is affection and compassion,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.360]   make my joy complete.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:38.140]   By being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.840]   How does that happen?
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.140]   Verse 3 and following.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.580]   Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind,
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.720]   regard one another as more important than yourselves.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.960]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.360]   And here the model to follow for humiliation.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.660]   Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:14.120]   who, although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.800]   but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave and being made in the likeness of men,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.940]   being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of faith,
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.540]   by being a slave to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.760]   There is the model of humility.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.940]   The Son of God who was and always will be God did not regard that equality with God,
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.060]   that eternal equality with God something to hold onto, but divested Himself of the privileges
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.900]   of that identity.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.600]   Became a slave, became a man.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.000]   He was a servant of God, a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.060]   And when he was a servant of God, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.680]   And so on, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.380]   And so on, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.240]   And so on, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.900]   And so on, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.660]   And so on, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.740]   And so on, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.800]   And so on, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.300]   And so on, he was a servant of God, and so on.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.060]   We need to humble ourselves, and he's our example.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.940]   He was willing to step down from heaven all the way to death on a cross for us, for our
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.160]   salvation.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.920]   Are we willing to humble ourselves to love each other, to manifest the unity that will
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.940]   bring honor to Him?
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.980]   That's the point.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.140]   And there's one final motivation here for this kind of humility.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.960]   Verse 9: "For this reason also God highly
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.300]   exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.800]   Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.720]   and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.640]   There is the exaltation of the Son, an incredibly rich portion of Scripture, one to be studied,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.160]   one to be meditated upon.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.660]   It speaks of the fact that the one who is exalted is the one who is exalted.
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:34.040]   In fact, the one who humbled himself before God was exalted by God to a place that was
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.080]   higher even than he had been before.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.160]   There were new honors, new privileges that were his.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:53.580]   Even though he was the eternal God, even though he was all that God is, by his humiliation,
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.360]   he was then honored to a place.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.320]   He was then honored to a place with even more honor than he had had before.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.620]   This is the model of humiliation.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.660]   Follow Christ, have this attitude in you, which is to say, "Humble yourself and let
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.600]   God exalt you."
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.220]   Listen to what Peter said, 1 Peter 5: "God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.440]   the humble.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.060]   Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hands of God."
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.500]   What does it mean, "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God"?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.320]   Understand this, that God is sovereign, and whatever difficulties you are going through,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.700]   whatever issues you face in life, they are within the framework of the mighty hand of
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.000]   God.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.220]   And they are better for you if they humble you than they would be if they exalted you.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.760]   God is opposed to the proud.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760]   1 Peter 5:1-3.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.460]   "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God."
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:07.020]   It's not as if you're humbling yourself under the hand of man or even the hand of Satan.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:14.080]   You're humbling yourself under the sovereign, mighty, providential hand of God, knowing
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.800]   that whatever you may suffer will be turned to eternal joy and gladness and reward.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.460]   James says, "Count it all joy when you fall into various trials."
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.700]   So even in the midst of the trial there is benefit, spiritual benefit.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.940]   In the midst of the trial we are going through, we are being perfected.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.320]   James says it has a perfecting work.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.520]   Paul says it has an empowering work.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.020]   Even in the midst of the trial and the suffering and the injustice and the things that are
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.940]   unfair, the Lord is shaping us, humbling us, shapes us.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.160]   The Lord is also in the same very difficult circumstances.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.900]   He is in the same very difficult circumstances, adding up our eternal reward for those who
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.960]   suffer for Him, will be glorified with Him.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.920]   And nothing can change that, because nothing can ever separate us from His love.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:18.580]   So the message of the apostle Paul is a powerful, powerful message.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.860]   The humiliation of Jesus in itself is a glorious theological reality.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.000]   But Paul is using it here as an illustration of the kind of conduct he wants from believers.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.020]   You need to humble yourself, and however much you think you deserve, you don't deserve what
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.700]   Christ rightly deserved and willingly yielded up.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.580]   You're far less than He is.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:53.560]   And if He humbled Himself from a place so high, infinitely beyond where you are, to
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:01.740]   a place so low, far beyond where you're asked to go, who are you to be unwilling as a sinner
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.780]   to humble yourself so that God can exalt you?
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.780]   That's the message.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.300]   And let's look at verses 9 to 11, the exaltation of Christ.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.720]   And this is really the capstone on Paul's entire presentation here.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.260]   He wants you to see how high Christ was exalted.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:33.480]   "So that you will be motivated to lower yourself, to humble yourself, and let God
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.140]   exalt you."
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.120]   Now remember the principle, we read it in several places.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:47.240]   God hates the proud, God resists the proud, but God gives grace to the humble.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.440]   So humble yourselves.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.960]   Humble yourselves and God will exalt you.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.160]   That is the message of Scripture.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.820]   In the case of what Paul is saying here, he's saying, "Humble yourself to the place," described
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:09.340]   in verse 3, "where you do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.500]   you regard one another as more important than yourselves and the interests of others more
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.460]   important than your own."
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.700]   That is the attitude of Christ.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.660]   He was willing to empty Himself.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:28.980]   He was willing to empty Himself of all that He possessed as the eternal Son for the sake
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.380]   of others who were undeserving.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.800]   This is the model.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.620]   We are to go low, and then God will lift us up.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:49.420]   Verses 9 to 11 are so rich that you could literally go from this portion to many, many
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.360]   other scriptures throughout the New Testament.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:10:00.560]   I'm going to resist doing that for the sake of time, but I want you to catch something
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.980]   of what these verses are saying about Christ's exaltation.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:12.860]   And keep in mind, this is to motivate you to say, "It's more important for me to be
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:20.260]   exalted by God, therefore I humble myself, than it is for me to exalt myself and be humbled
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.060]   by God."
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:32.200]   When God exalts someone, He exalts him to the highest place.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   And we see this in the case of Christ.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.000]   Because He came all the way down to the cross, God lifts Him all the way up to the highest
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.500]   exaltation in the heavens.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.120]   God is the source of His exaltation.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.760]   God is the one who exalts His Son.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:58.720]   Because of what He did in His suffering and humiliation, God highly exalted Him.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.420]   It's a Greek word, "super-exalted Him."
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:08.640]   There wouldn't be enough prefixes or adjectives to describe the elevation.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:17.940]   He exalted Him in a way that even was beyond the exaltation that He had had before.
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.460]   God raised Him from the dead.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.780]   God drew Him into heaven.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.600]   God seated Him at His right hand.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.120]   God crowned Him with honor and glory.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.420]   God exalted Him.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:40.080]   The apostle Paul says in chapter 1 of Ephesians that when God exalted Him, He seated Him,
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:46.520]   verse 20, "at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.160]   and dominion and every name that is named."
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   .
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.400]   Not only in this age, but also in the one to come.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.940]   God exalted Him.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:03.280]   God highly exalted Him, placed Him at His right hand, far above, not just above, far
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.480]   above all rule, authority, power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.780]   this age, but the age to come.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.920]   Again, God exalts Christ.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.860]   Because Christ humbled Himself, God exalted Him.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.860]   .
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:26.100]   The wonderful of all revelations of this exaltation is found in Hebrews, chapter 1.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:34.420]   You want to look at Hebrews 1 and just follow the marvelous truth of this chapter.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.860]   God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets in many portions and in many
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.360]   ways, "In these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.700]   things, through whom also He made the world; and He is the radiance of His glory in the
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.560]   exact representation of His glory.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   He is the one who is the Lord of all things, and He is the one who is the Lord of all things."
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   .
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:03.220]   When He, the Son, had made purification of sins, that is, died on the cross, He sat down
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:11.620]   at the right hand of the majesty on high, having become as much better than the angels,
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.480]   as He has inherited a more exalted or excellent name than they.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.260]   He is more honored than He's ever been because He has accomplished His glory.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:26.080]   He has accomplished God's redemptive purpose.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:34.300]   He died and rose that He might be Lord, Lord of the dead and Lord of the living.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:43.220]   The many portions of Scripture that speak about that, that His return to heaven signaled
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.860]   a new place of authority.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.960]   Listen to Colossians 1:18: "He is the head of the body of the church.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.240]   He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.340]   first place in everything."
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:04.260]   That was the Father's good pleasure.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:10.280]   So first thing to understand about the exaltation of Christ is that God is the source.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.840]   God is the one who exalted Christ.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.740]   Many other Scriptures speak to that.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.000]   The second.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.660]   How are we to understand this?
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.380]   This new position.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.900]   The title of His exaltation answers that, the title.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.720]   So we saw the source of the exaltation is God, the title.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.960]   And what is the title?
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:41.900]   Back to verse 9: "And bestowed on Him, gave Him, granted Him the name which is above every
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.900]   name."
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.360]   Hebrews 1:4, I just read, "A name more excellent than the angels."
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.360]   Ephesians 1:1.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:56.420]   "A name higher than all rule, authority, power, and dominion, and every name that is
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.420]   named."
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.600]   This is the ultimate name above every other name.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.260]   A name, a name, a title.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.060]   This is the title.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.600]   What is this name?
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.360]   What is this title?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:19.060]   It is not Jesus; that was already His name.
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:24.480]   It is a name that speaks of absolute sovereignty.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:31.580]   It was common to signal a new stage in someone's life by giving him a new name.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:42.820]   Abram became Abraham, and Jacob became Israel, and Saul became Paul, and Simon became Peter.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.220]   Jesus was given a new name as well.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.440]   What is that name?
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.200]   It's given in verse 11: "Jesus Christ is Lord."
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   That's the new name.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.680]   It is the name that is above every name.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.840]   The name Jesus is not the name above every name; that's just a reference to the Old Testament
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.840]   name Joshua.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.420]   A lot of people had that name; a lot of people still have that name.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.820]   Jehovah saves.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.440]   But this is a name that is above every name.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.560]   It is the name Lord.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.320]   "Lord."
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:25.080]   No other name than Lord, or if you will, an Old Testament equivalent, Yahweh, can be
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.300]   the name above all other names.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:35.220]   The whole context flows to that confession down in verse 11: "Jesus Christ is Lord."
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.500]   Jesus was a very common name.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.300]   Jesus was the name given to Him in His humiliation.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.920]   But He is given a name above every name.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.200]   This name causes every need.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   "He is Lord."
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   It can be a name above all other names.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   It's the name of the Lord.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   "He is Lord."
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   This is the name of the Lord.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   He is a name above all other names.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   "He is Lord."
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.120]   Jesus had many names, titles: Messiah, Emmanuel, Son of God, Son of Man, Christ, the Word.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.340]   But Lord is the name above every name.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.420]   Kurios, it means "absolute ruler."
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.880]   "He is Lord by His Father's doing."
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.840]   We don't make Him Lord; no one does.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.960]   He is Lord.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.080]   "The great Christian cry.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   'He is Lord.'"
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.080]   That is our confession.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   "He is Lord."
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   It indicates power, absolute power, absolute authority, dignity, honor, dominion, worthiness,
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.080]   rule.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:38.460]   If you want to be a Christian, Romans 10 says, "Confess with your mouth, 'Jesus as Lord,'
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.580]   and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:47.960]   It was His resurrection by which God honored Him and established Him as Lord."
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   He raised Him from the dead, drew Him to His throne, and crowned Him Lord.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.320]   The book of Revelation says, "King of kings and Lord of lords."
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:05.900]   So the title of the exaltation of Christ is Lord, Lord of lords, Lord above all power,
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:12.640]   all authority, all dominion, every name that is named in this age or the age to come.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.960]   Now what is the response?
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.960]   The third thing that Paul points to is a response to His call.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.960]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.040]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.080]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.080]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.100]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.140]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:17.220]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:17.300]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:17.360]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:17.420]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:17.500]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:17.540]   He says, "I am the Lord of lords."
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.660]   Every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.780]   So what is the response?
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.300]   Worship.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:19:00.340]   This is the only appropriate response to Christ, and ultimately will be the response of everyone.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.060]   Did you hear that?
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.340]   Everyone will one day bow the knee to Christ.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.880]   Those of us who confess Jesus is Lord now,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:10.960]   Those of us who confess Jesus is Lord now,
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.780]   Those of us who confess Jesus is Lord now,
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.960]   we have bowed the knee.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:20.680]   Those who reject Christ and go into eternity without Him end up in eternal punishment in hell.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.960]   Will every moment of their tenure in hell, every everlasting moment,
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:34.400]   be recognizing that, in fact, Jesus is Lord, and they failed to acknowledge it?
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   He is Lord.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.680]   The idea that He is Lord over those who are in heaven and on earth,
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   and under the earth, is not intended to make three distinctions between beings in locations,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.460]   but simply to say that's everywhere.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:59.200]   You're either in heaven, or on earth, or in the earth, or under the earth.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   It covers the ground.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.700]   Every knee will bow.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:11.580]   So the one true God, the Son, came into the world, humbled Himself, and He will bow the knee.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:19.360]   The Father then exalted Him, gave Him the title Lord over everyone,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:28.860]   and now commands that the entire universe of conscious beings bow their knee to Him,
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:35.080]   whether they are angels or men and women, they all bow.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:41.480]   Whether they're holy angels or damned angels, whether they are saints or sinners,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.480]   whether they are in heaven or hell, they all bow the knee,
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.100]   and they all ultimately confess Jesus is Lord.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.300]   Every tongue will confess that.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:01.440]   Every tongue, meaning, will acknowledge it.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:09.640]   Every tongue, whether in hell or heaven, will say, "Yes, Jesus is Lord."
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.380]   We rejected Him.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.480]   We refused Him.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.820]   But He is Lord.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:24.560]   This God will do for Him, exalt Him to this level, so that everyone bows the knee to Him.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.780]   What an astonishing exaltation.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.940]   But what is the reason?
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.940]   What's the motive?
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.940]   The source is God.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.100]   The title is Lord.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.500]   The response is worship.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.780]   But what's the purpose?
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.280]   Back to verse 11: "To the glory of God the Father."
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.020]   The Father ultimately gets glory.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.200]   To the glory of the Father.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.320]   The Father is honored when the Son is worshiped.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.480]   The Father is honored when the Son is worshiped.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.060]   The Father said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.020]   Listen to Him.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.660]   The Father is honored when the Son is worshiped.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.520]   God is exalted by what Christ has accomplished.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.180]   God is glorified when you honor His Son.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:20.200]   The entire conscious universe of beings in heaven or hell will all confess Jesus is Lord,
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:25.940]   and that will affirm what God has declared, and God will be glorified.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:32.940]   He will be glorified in judgment as well as in eternal blessing.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:41.080]   Ultimately, everything resolves itself in God's final glory.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:49.620]   The gospel, then, is the story of humiliation and exaltation.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:59.900]   The one who is God stoops all the way down to become man, takes the role of a servant,
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.740]   willing to die, die on a cross.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:08.660]   And because He accomplished our redemption, the Father exalts Him back to where He was
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.980]   with new honors and new glory.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.580]   glory, for having accomplished redemption.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:22.560]   Gives Him a name above every name, the name Lord.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.360]   Declares that anybody who comes to Him must say, "Jesus is Lord."
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.980]   And this in itself is the glory of the redemptive work of Christ.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:37.640]   But in this passage, this is an illustration to you and me, that you would be a whole lot
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:45.040]   better off to humble yourself and let God glorify you than to glorify yourself and cause
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.320]   Him to humble you.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.840]   Because when God glorifies you, He takes you to places that are unimaginable.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.080]   The Bible says, "He seats you on the throne with His Son.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.020]   He makes you an heir of all things.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.600]   Eye hasn't seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered the heart of man the things that God
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   has made."
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   .
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   .
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:07.640]   .
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.520]   is prepared for them that love Him.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:21.500]   That's why Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4, "For momentary light affliction is producing for
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.760]   us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison."
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.800]   So life hasn't given you everything you want.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.840]   Embrace that.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.020]   Be humbled by that.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.180]   Be unconcerned about your own issues.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.220]   Give yourself in love to others.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:45.940]   Be a part of the unity of the church, and wait until the Lord exalts you with an eternal
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.600]   weight of glory.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.940]   The next verse in 2 Corinthians 4 says, "We look not at the things which are seen, but
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.280]   at the things which are not seen; for the things that are seen are temporal, things
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.220]   that are not seen are eternal."
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.560]   Don't try to squeeze everything you think you deserve out of this life.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.720]   Humble yourself and wait for the unimaginable.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:14.780]   The unimaginable things that God has for you in your eternal inheritance, which is imperishable,
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.580]   undefiled, unfading, and reserved in heaven.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:26.800]   Don't spend your life trying to demand your rights, trying to get what you think you deserve,
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.020]   being angry at people or vengeful.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.180]   Be humble.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.180]   Don't be conceited.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.180]   Don't be self-centered.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.260]   Be concerned about others.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.600]   Be loving.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:45.680]   Do everything you can to create unity, and leave the future exaltation to the Lord, because
