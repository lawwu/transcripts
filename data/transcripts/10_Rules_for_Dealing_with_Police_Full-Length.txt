[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.720]   I've been a judge, but I'm best known
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   as a criminal defense lawyer.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.720]   I know how the law works, and I know that for many people,
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   the law sometimes doesn't work.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.720]   But I'm gonna show you how to make the law work for you.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.720]   I see how the choices my clients make
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   have a massive impact on the outcomes
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.720]   of their police encounters,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   even if, and especially if,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.720]   you've done nothing wrong.

[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   a few too many cops who don't respect
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   the basic rights of innocent people.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   But you don't get to choose who you're dealing with.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   And even the nicest cop will use your mistakes against you.

[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.720]   That cop profiled me.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   It's ridiculous.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   I go to school. I'm not a gun trafficker.

[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.720]   It's certainly possible you were profiled,
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   but it's practically impossible
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   to prove that.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   You never know for sure

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   I hate to say it,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   but from what I hear, it sounds like
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.720]   you broke the first rule of dealing with the police.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.720]   Always be calm
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   and cool.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   Hold up. Are you saying that he deserved
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.720]   to get treated like that?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   No, what I'm saying is a police encounter
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   is absolutely the worst time and place
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   to vent your frustrations about police.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   Getting stopped by police is always frustrating
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.720]   and scary, but
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   you could have played it much smarter
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   by being calm and cool.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.720]   As soon as you opened your mouth,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   you failed the attitude test.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.720]   License and registration?
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   Yeah, I know the drill, man.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   Your attitude only got worse.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   Whatever, man.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.720]   Don't ever talk back.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   Don't ever raise your voice.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.720]   Don't ever use profanity with the police officers.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   Being hostile with police
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   is stupid and dangerous.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   You can't win that game
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   on the street where they're the king.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   Police have a dangerous job.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   Even the most professional officers
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   might become aggressive if they feel threatened
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   or if their authority
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   is challenged.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   Always control your words,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.720]   the tone of your voice,
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   and your body language.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   If you're visibly scared and angry,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   it's easy for an officer to get scared and angry, too.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   Things could have turned out
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.720]   way worse than they did.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   Now!

[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   On your stomach!
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   Can you think of a better way
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   you could have greeted that officer?
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   Good evening, officer.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   How's it going?
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   That's better. Calm and cool.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   Hold it, hold it, hold it.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   What's all this polite talk?
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   They don't respect us, so why should we respect them?
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   For real.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   This isn't just about respect.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   It's about common sense.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   If you don't check
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   your ego at the door
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   and you let it take control
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   of you during a police encounter,
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   you'll regret it every time.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   Following the rules doesn't guarantee
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   that the police will respect your rights,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   but they can keep you from digging yourself
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.720]   into a deeper hole.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   Let's talk about what your rights are in the first place.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   This is the Bill of Rights.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   These are the first ten amendments
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   that were added to the U.S. Constitution
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   after it was ratified in 1789.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.720]   These rights are protected under federal law,
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.720]   which means everything we're talking about today
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   applies in all 50 states.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   There are three amendments in particular
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.720]   that protect your rights during police encounters.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   The fourth amendment states
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   that the right of the people
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   to be secure in their persons,
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   houses, papers, and effects
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   against unreasonable searches
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   and seizures shall not be violated.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   The fifth amendment states
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   that no person shall be compelled
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   in any criminal case to be a witness
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   against himself, nor be deprived
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   of life, liberty, or property
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   without due process of law.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   During a police encounter,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.720]   the smartest way to take the fifth
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   is just to keep your mouth shut
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   because you always have the right
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   to remain silent.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   [dramatic music]
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   We'll talk in a minute
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   about how this works.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   In all criminal prosecutions,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.720]   the accused shall enjoy the right
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   to have the assistance of counsel
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   for his defense.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   So if the police interrogate
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   or arrest you,
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   asking for a lawyer is a good way
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   to assert your right to remain silent.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.720]   - Boy, you're up.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   - That's right.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.720]   - As you have seen on TV,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   police don't usually have to read you
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   your rights, even if you're arrested.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   So it's up to you
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   to make sure
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   that you understand the law
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   and make smart choices.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   If police flag you down,
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   pull over immediately, turn off your car,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   and place your hands on the wheel.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   The police like to see your hands
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   for their own safety, so wait until
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   they request your paperwork before reaching for it.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   At night, it's also a good idea
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   to turn on the interior light
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   so that the officer can see you're not armed.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Darren, do you see any ways
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   you could have handled yourself better?
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.720]   - Good evening, officer. How's it going?
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   - Did you know you were swerving between lanes?
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   - No, officer.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   - Let me see your license
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   and registration. - Sure.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.720]   My license?
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.720]   Here's my registration.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   - Now, Darren,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   we've had some problems with gangs
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   moving guns down this highway.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   You're not packing any tech-9s, are you?
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   - No, sir. - I didn't think so.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   So you don't mind if I take a look, do you?
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   - Officer, I know you're just
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   doing your job. I don't have any guns
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   or whatever, but I don't consent
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   to searches. - Perfect!
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   Rule number three.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   You have the right to refuse searches.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   This comes directly from the police.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   You have the right to refuse searches.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   This comes directly from the Fourth Amendment.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   For your Fourth Amendment protection to legally apply,
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   you must be prepared to clearly
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   state your refusal under pressure.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   Everyone repeat after me.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   I don't consent to searches.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   - I don't consent to searches.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   - The officers can't hear you,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   so say it again.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   - I don't consent to searches.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   - One more time.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   - I don't consent to searches.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   - Are you a law student or something?
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   So if I show that I know the rules,
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   he might think I'm a law student,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   or maybe I got big legal connections.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.720]   - Perhaps.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   But don't get carried away by saying
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   stuff like... - I know my rights,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   [bleep]! Get out of my face, [bleep]!
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   I'ma sue you!
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   - Never tell the officer
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   you know your rights.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   - You seem nervous.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   Is there anything in this car I need to know about?
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.720]   - No, officer.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.720]   - All right.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.720]   Please step out of the vehicle.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   - Police may legally order you out of your vehicle,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   so you should comply.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   - Walk back here with me.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.720]   Stand right here for me.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   Now, you got two choices.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   You can make this better,
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   or worse for yourself.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   Now, if you cooperate,
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   it's gonna make things a lot easier on you.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   - Beware that the police
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   may legally lie to you,
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   so never let false threats or promises
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   trick you into waiving your rights.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   - Now, if you don't,
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   I'm gonna call up a K-9 unit, and those dogs are gonna
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.720]   rip apart your car, and they're gonna find what you're hiding.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   So what's it gonna be?
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   - Refusing a search request is not evidence of guilt
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   and doesn't give the officer
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   the legal right to search or detain you.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.720]   Don't get tricked.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   Unless you're detained or arrested,
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   you may terminate the encounter at any time,
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   but don't wait for the officer to dismiss you.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   Simply ask if you're free to go.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   - They're in those dogs are gonna rip apart your car,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   and they're gonna find what you're hiding.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   Like I said, what's it gonna be?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   - Officer, are you detaining me, or am I free to go?
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.720]   - Good.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   This line can help withdraw you from an encounter.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   Saying you want to leave
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   establishes that the encounter is not voluntary,
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   which could help you later if you end up in court.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   Let's practice that line.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   Everyone repeat after me.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   Are you detaining me, or am I free to go?
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.720]   - Are you detaining me, or am I free to go?
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   - One more time.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   Are you detaining me, or am I free to go?
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   - All right.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   You want to play it like that?
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   You want to bump it up to the next level? Fine.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   You stay right here. Don't go anywhere.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   - Asserting your rights won't make the police love you,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.720]   but it might make them extra cautious
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   about violating your rights.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.720]   - One seven five second as you test for that.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   Do you see the guy?
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   - Darren, this is a citation
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   for excessive lane changing.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   Take care of that as soon as possible.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   - Thank you, officer.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   I understand refusing a search doesn't make me guilty,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.720]   but if I'm doing nothing wrong,
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   why don't I just let the police search me
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   and get it done with?
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   - You have the right to let police search you.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   You also have the right to refuse. The choice is yours.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   But there are some reasons to think carefully about this.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   The officer isn't your butler.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   Searches can get real messy.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   If they damage anything,
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   you might not be compensated
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   because you agreed to the search.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   Besides, you never know for sure
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   what a careless person, relative, friend,
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   previous owner
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   might have left in your car at some point.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   If the police find any illegal items
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   after you consent to a search request,
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   you can be arrested
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.720]   even if you had nothing to do with it.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   - You have the right to remain silent.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.720]   - Consenting to a search request
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   automatically makes the search legal
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.720]   in the eyes of the law,
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   but it doesn't require officers to tell you
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.720]   about your right to refuse.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   So if you're pulled over,
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   don't try to figure out
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   whether or not the officer has probable cause
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   to legally search you.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   You always have the right to refuse searches.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   - I don't consent to searches.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   - But they're gonna search us anyway.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.720]   - Sometimes they will,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.720]   but saying no isn't just about stopping the search.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   It might stop the search,
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.720]   or it might not.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   - Cross your legs.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   - The point is that refusing the search
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.720]   could help you later if you end up in court.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   If the police search you without consent,
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.720]   your lawyer can challenge that.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   As your attorney,
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   I'd be much more likely to win your case
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.720]   if you said no to the search.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   - If I do not consent,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.720]   when are police allowed to search my car?
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.720]   You mentioned probable cause.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   What does that mean?
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   - Probable cause means
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   police must have clear facts or evidence
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   to believe you're involved in criminal activity.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   In other words, an officer's hunch
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   without evidence of illegal activity
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   is not enough to search or arrest you.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.720]   But it doesn't take much.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.720]   Most avoidable police searches
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.720]   happen not because police have probable cause.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   They happen because people
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   get tricked or intimidated into consenting.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   - So an expired registration
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.720]   isn't probable cause to search my car?
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.720]   - No, it's not.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   But you still gotta be careful.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.720]   Courts are eager
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   to uphold police searches,
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   so something suspicious about you or your car
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   could be considered probable cause.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   I'm not the kind of guy to tell you
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   how you should express yourself.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   Expressing yourself is one thing,
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   but exposing yourself to police
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   by being a public nuisance is ignorant.

[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   - Mr. Murphy,
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   I appreciate you being here,
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   talking about constitutional rights and all,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   but in my hood, police don't care about nobody's rights.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   They do whatever they want.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   - Tell us more.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   - The other day, I was leaving my building

[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   Put 'em on the car.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   Spread 'em.

[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   - I ain't got nothing.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   - Let me see your pockets.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   Pull 'em out!
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   Your ID?
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   - Got an ID here.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   - Run that, please. Let me see your hat.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.720]   I seen you coming out of there.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   - Yeah, that's a known drug spot.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   - It's my home. That's where I live at.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   - You go to school?
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   Or you working?
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   - I work at a restaurant. That's where I'm going.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   - Okay.

[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   Thank you for your cooperation.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   You stay out of trouble.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   - This is not the first time.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   It probably ain't the last.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.720]   That's how they do around here.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   - I'm not surprised.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   In cities across the country, these stop-and-frisks
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   are occurring at record rates,
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   especially in low-income communities of color.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   They happen so frequently,
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   they seem perfectly normal to you.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   - Yeah, that's how they do.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   - This might be common,
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   but that doesn't make it right.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   In fact, it sounds like those cops searched you illegally.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   - Show me your hands.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   Put 'em on the car.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   - If police have reasonable suspicion
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   to believe you're involved in a crime,
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   they're legally allowed to detain you
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   for a short period of time.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.720]   Reasonable suspicion
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.720]   requires less evidence than probable cause,
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   but it basically means the officer
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   has some specific reason
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.720]   to believe that you're up to something.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   For example, police can legally stop someone
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   who matches the description of a criminal suspect--
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   a suspect who drops a suspicious object
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.720]   after seeing the police,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   or someone who runs away after seeing the police.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   Don't ever run from the police.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   That's part of what the officers can use for probable cause,
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.720]   and they'll run you down and make you regret it.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   - Say, "Stay down!"
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.720]   - But if you see police approaching,
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   be calm and assert your rights if need be, but don't run.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   If they have reasonable suspicion to detain you,
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   police may pat down the outside of your clothing
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   to check for weapons,
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   but only if they have a basis for suspecting that you're armed.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   If they feel a hard item that might be a weapon,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   the police may pull it out of your pocket to check it out.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   Police may ask you to show them what's in your pockets.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   Remember, you don't have to do it.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   Emptying your pockets is the same as consenting to a search,
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   and you always have the right to refuse.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   In your case, there appeared to be no basis
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   to justify their stop and frisk.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   - It happened so fast, it was over before I even knew it.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   What could I have done differently?
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   - You don't have a lot of immediate options here.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   If police detain and frisk you,
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   you have the right to clearly state your refusal
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   to the consent to the search.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   - Officer, I'm not resistant,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   but I do not consent to searchings.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.720]   - But you should only verbally refuse,
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.720]   never physically resist, never.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   Just touching a cop could get you tasered or beaten.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   You could also get charged with felony assault.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:07.720]   - Face forward.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   - Sometimes people get in trouble
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   for merely standing near others holding contraband,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   or if it is found nearby.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   - Look what we have here.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   - Police may try to get you to snitch on yourself or on others,
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   but remember that police may legally lie to you,
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   so don't get tricked into waiving your rights.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   - Mm, I love it.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   - We know you bought this weed.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   That makes you part of a drug conspiracy.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   Now you give up your supplier,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.720]   or else we're gonna charge you as an accessory to drug trafficking.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   - I'm going to remain silent. I'd like to see a lawyer.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.720]   - "I'm going to remain silent. I'd like to see a lawyer."
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   If you're being interrogated or you're under arrest,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   these magic words are your best legal protection.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   They're kind of like a legal condom.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   Say 'em with me.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   all: I'm going to remain silent.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   I'd like to see a lawyer.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   - I seen you drop this, man.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   Just admit it's yours. It's a slap on the wrist.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   You make things difficult for me,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   and I'll charge you with possession and evidence tampering.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   That's a felony.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   - Don't get tricked. You know what to say.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   If police pressure you to snitch, you need a lawyer.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   Use the magic words.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   - Officer, I'm going to remain silent.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   I'd like to see a lawyer.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   - But remember, just because you ask for a lawyer
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   doesn't mean they have to stop questioning you.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   If you keep talking, your words might still be used against you,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   so shut your mouth until you've seen a lawyer.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   - But when do you actually get a lawyer?
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   - That depends.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.720]   If you keep your mouth shut, you might not even need one,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.720]   but if you're arrested and charged with a crime,
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   you need help.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.720]   If you can't afford a lawyer,
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   one will be appointed for you by the court.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   The point is that you can't talk your way out
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   of a police interrogation without a lawyer.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   That's a big mistake.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   Almost anything you say to the police
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   can and will be used against you in court.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   - But what if the police try to make you sign
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   a confession or something?
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   - Don't sign anything without a lawyer,
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   and don't rely on the police to explain what it says.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   Read it for yourself.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   Usually the only document that's safe to sign
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   is a promise to appear in court.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   - What if police come up to me just asking for an ID?
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   - Hey, hold up, man. Let me see your ID.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   - Carrying an ID is required when you're driving,
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   but there's otherwise no law requiring you to carry an ID.

[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   and closed the door behind her.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   - Good afternoon, officers.

[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   - Do you have a warrant?
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   What is this about?
