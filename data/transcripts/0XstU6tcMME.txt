[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Happy Friday everyone. We're back once more to close out the week with parenting expert
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.480]   Ted Tripp. He's been with us all week. And Dr. Tripp, yesterday you explained the importance
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.960]   of physical discipline in training young children and your early reluctance to embrace the practice
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.560]   as a young parent. Scripture's not silent here, of course, but many Christian parents
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.560]   simply say, "You know what? I'm not going to do it. For whatever reason, we're not going
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.800]   to spank our kids." And you said last time you felt like this has been a losing battle
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.840]   for you over the last 40 years in America as fewer and fewer Christian families are
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.520]   willing to embrace this. So from your perspective, among faithful, church-going parents who love
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.600]   Jesus, love their Bibles, love their kids, what are the most common hurdles that prevent
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.480]   parents from using physical discipline in child training?
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.480]   You know, I think there are, I guess I have two answers to that question. One answer is
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.920]   that a lot of people are very influenced by the thought forms of the culture. I mean,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.080]   the world of ideas is like the world of fashion. Things are going out of style. The idea of
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.240]   physical discipline is not in style in our culture. So it's hard for people because in
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.000]   our culture, a parent who does physical discipline is regarded as kind of a simple-minded person
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.080]   who's not too creative and can't think of better ways to deal with children and occasionally
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.800]   gets upset and just hits their kids out of frustration. That's the image of physical
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.840]   discipline. So people think if you're in favor of spanking, what you're in favor of is this
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.880]   very capricious, arbitrary thing where a parent gets angry and when he's had it up to his
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.040]   eyeballs, he starts flailing his kids. And people think, "I don't want to be that kind
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.000]   of parent. I'm smarter than that. I want to do something more intelligent, more sensitive,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.520]   and something that would be better for my kids." So that's one set of problems.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.680]   I think also, Tony, we have to acknowledge that there are many people, young people who
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.040]   are parents today who are in their 20s and 30s who were raised by Christian people who
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   spanked them in anger. And they were abused. They were struck when their parents were angry
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.160]   and frustrated and out of sorts. And so the parents, when they struck them excessively,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.880]   struck them capriciously, something they might get away with one day, another day they would
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.760]   be spanked for. Spanking wasn't always an orderly process. Sometimes they would just
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.880]   get hit. And it was all under the rubric of "Spare the rod, spoil the child," which, by
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.320]   the way, is not in the Bible anywhere. And they promised themselves, "I will never do
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.560]   that to my kids. I hated that. I'm not going to be that kind of a parent."
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.640]   And I want to say to young couples who have had that life experience, I want to commend
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.880]   you. I want to stand in solidarity with you and say, "You must not do that. That was wrong.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.040]   It was wrong." However well-intentioned your parents might have been, it was wrong for
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.920]   them to discipline you in that way. But I want to offer to you something that is very,
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.240]   very different than that. So I think that a huge problem is that there are people who
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.080]   were abused. I think it's also important to make a distinction, and I've been doing this
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.840]   increasingly when I do seminars. I make a distinction between correction and discipline,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.560]   especially with little children. There are a lot of things that require correction that
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.800]   do not necessarily require discipline. And sometimes when parents embrace the idea of
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.600]   spanking and they say, "Okay, the Bible says I should do this. I'm going to do it," then
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.040]   they start spanking for everything. It's kind of like that old adage, you know, "If the
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.160]   only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." And so I think parents
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.800]   need to make a distinction. There are a lot of things that children do that are wrong,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   that require correction, that are not necessarily defiant. The only thing I want to discipline
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.040]   for is defiant behavior. Failure to honor, failure to obey mom and dad. Defiance I'm
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.800]   going to discipline. But there are a lot of other things that kids do that require correction.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:19.000]   "No, no, honey, you can't hit your sister." And I can talk to that child about the fact
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.480]   that you may not hit your sister. Now, if the hitting persists, obviously we're going
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.880]   to have to deal with that as disobedience, as discipline. But there are a lot of things
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.720]   or an illustration I gave in one of these earlier podcasts, the child that bowls over
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.920]   his younger sister and takes her toy, that's impulsive behavior on the part of the child.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.960]   He's a three-year-old. He's impulsive. He grabs, he sees something he wants, he grabs
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.680]   it, especially if he can overpower the person that has it. That's impulsive behavior. That's
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.840]   not defiant behavior. Now, does it require correction? Sure. "Honey, no, you can't do
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.720]   that. You must give that toy back to your sister." But it does not require discipline.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.560]   If I can have an intervention that solves the problem without discipline, by correcting,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.800]   that's going to be my first approach to wrong behavior. Defiant behavior I'm going to discipline.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.360]   There's a whole range of other behavior that is inappropriate and requires correction that
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.400]   is not defiant. And I don't want to use spanking for everything a toddler does that is wrong,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.720]   because then that kid's going to be getting spanked way too many times in a day. So I
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.760]   want to reserve spanking for those types of defiant behavior where the child refuses to
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.080]   submit to mom and dad's authority.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.120]   That is some seasoned advice. Thank you, Dr. Tripp. And thank you for joining us this week.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.040]   This is a topic worthy of careful examination. And I know there's a lot more to say and address
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.840]   than we had time to cover in this short podcast today and yesterday. And for more details
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.040]   on spanking, see chapter 11 of Dr. Tripp's bestselling book, Shepherding a Child's Heart.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.160]   There he addresses key biblical principles and common objections. And we really appreciate
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.600]   Ted's time on this podcast this week, filling in for John Piper. Ted Tripp is the author
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.240]   of the bestselling books, Shepherding a Child's Heart and Instructing a Child's Heart. And
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.080]   whenever we talk about physical discipline, I'm reminded that this topic has bigger ramifications.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.760]   And it makes us ask, how do I, as an adult, know if I'm being disciplined by God right
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.920]   now? Pastor John addressed that question back in episode number 45 of this podcast. Be sure
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.840]   to check out that episode in the podcast archive, most easily navigated in the Ask Pastor John
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.380]   app for the iPhone and the Android. And speaking of Pastor John, he will be back on Monday
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.480]   to field a question from North Africa. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Have a wonderful weekend.
