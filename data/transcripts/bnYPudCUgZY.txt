[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580]   First though, let's do a deep dive.
[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   So I'm gonna do a deep dive on an idea
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.160]   I've been thinking about.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.660]   I'm calling this the feedback council idea.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.120]   And I'm gonna open with an article.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.380]   I don't wanna spend a lot of time on this article.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.660]   It's just gonna motivate this bigger idea
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.300]   of feedback councils.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.980]   So I saw this article the other day,
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.360]   a listener sent it to me,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.700]   to the interesting@calnewport.com address.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.260]   So there was this article that appeared in the New York Times
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.260]   that was about CNN's new leadership.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.380]   So this is from June 5th, as you can see here.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.100]   So what has happened at CNN is there is a shakeup.
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.100]   There is a new head of CNN, Chris Licht, L-I-C-H-T,
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.140]   who is trying to do lots of things to shake up the network,
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.980]   among other things,
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.980]   now that Donald Trump's no longer president,
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.020]   they're shifting away from more of a
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.660]   high energy adversarial style of reporting
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.180]   to try to be a little bit more down the center.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.220]   There's a lot of changes that Chris Licht is doing,
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.860]   but there was one in particular that caught my attention.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.060]   That's what I wanna highlight here.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.460]   So for those who are watching,
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.460]   you can actually see the article.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.740]   For those listening at home,
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.180]   you just hear me talking about it.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.780]   So we have right here,
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.780]   producers have been urged to ignore Twitter backlash
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.520]   from the far right and the far left.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.380]   All right, that I think is a good idea.
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.320]   I wanna explain why I think it's a good idea,
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.200]   because it will give us some ideas about
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960]   how the rest of us should be thinking
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.400]   about living our lives in a digital world,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.240]   whether or not we run a network.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.640]   So to explain why I think that's a good idea,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.360]   let's start with the notion of feedback more generally,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   and in particular, the role of feedback for human beings.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.960]   Human beings are wired, neurologically speaking,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.560]   to take feedback from other human beings very seriously.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.720]   We pay a lot of attention to it.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.440]   It has a lot of effect on how we feel.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.880]   So we're very wired for this.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.660]   Now there's two good reasons for this
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.520]   from an evolutionary perspective.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.880]   One is tribal cohesion.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.580]   So when you can watch and monitor very carefully
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.640]   the reaction of people around you to what you're saying,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   it allows you to adjust what you're saying
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.280]   in such a way to try to maintain social comedy,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.380]   to maintain positive affect between people.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.080]   You see the body language show,
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.200]   uh-oh, I'm going into dangerous territory here.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.160]   You pull back a little bit.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   This helps keeps tribal groups happy amongst themselves.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.600]   Now I talk about the neuroscientific backing
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.000]   for how this happens a little bit
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.780]   in my book, "Digital Minimalism."
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.900]   I get into how much of our brain is actually dedicated
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.940]   to processing all these complex input channels
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.960]   that come from person-to-person interaction.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.420]   But the high-level summary there is
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.780]   we monitor the people around us while we are talking,
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.060]   and we take that feedback very seriously.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.180]   It's very affecting.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.180]   The other advantage of feedback from other humans
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.260]   is that it extends our ability to cogitate
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.060]   beyond just our own brains.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.100]   And if there's a group of people,
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.440]   getting feedback from other people in the group
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.940]   on a plan, on an idea, on an initiative,
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.560]   allows you to essentially tap into the cognitive potential
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.320]   of these other brains, forming a larger collective brain
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.340]   that is more nuanced and smarter
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.140]   than any one brain potentially in isolation.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.640]   This was a great trick of evolution.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.240]   It requires complex language to do it,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.360]   but once we have this trick,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.840]   it really allowed us to upgrade quickly
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.480]   our ability to actually think and make good decisions.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.800]   Now, of course, leaving the evolutionary past
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.760]   and going into the more recent cultural past
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.840]   of human beings, we see this extended cogitation idea
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.320]   maybe reach its apogee with the scientific method,
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.840]   where now we can formally receive feedback on ideas
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   in a very structured and formalized way
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.880]   that really helps aim our attention
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.200]   towards scientific realities away from some things
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.800]   that aren't.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.320]   So again, getting feedback from other people
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.000]   is a huge part of the human experience.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.880]   All right, so we take it seriously,
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.120]   our brain cares about it.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.500]   The issue with the social internet,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.880]   and in particular, the more recent last 10 year rise
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   of widely used social media platforms on the social internet
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.440]   is that it introduced into our cultural ecosystem
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.200]   new forms of feedback.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.720]   Feedback that we did not have access to before,
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   feedback that is of a decidedly different character
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.560]   than the type of feedback that our brain has been wired
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.600]   to take very seriously.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.320]   So there's really two things that differentiate
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.040]   the feedback you get from, let's say, Twitter or Instagram
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.840]   versus what you would get from your tribe
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.080]   a hundred thousand years ago.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.980]   One, it's a biased sample.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.400]   So when you're getting feedback from the internet,
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.960]   it's not as if you are randomly sampling the population
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.640]   and getting a true representative sense
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   of how people feel about what you just said.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.160]   It's not as if like it is in our Paleolithic path,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.200]   it's the same group of people giving you feedback
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.800]   that have given you feedback on everything else.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.000]   So if their opinion shifts,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.360]   then that's probably represents
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.440]   there's something going on here you should pay attention to.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.080]   Instead, the internet has these weird connectivity
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.800]   and virality dynamics where anyone can give feedback
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.080]   to anyone else, and what selects someone
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   to wanna give feedback to you
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.320]   can be quite arbitrary or unusual.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.000]   There could be something about what you said
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.160]   that got spread through some sort
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.640]   of viral amplification network,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.520]   and it got to some malcontent over here,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.200]   and then they can directly message you back
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.140]   with some feedback.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.520]   It's not a true sample of people
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.720]   whose opinions you care about,
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.200]   it's a biased sample, it's unpredictable.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.600]   The other issue with feedback from the social internet
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.660]   is that a lot of it is in bad faith.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.320]   If you're talking to, let's say your sister,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.960]   in general, they're probably trying
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.360]   to give you good feedback.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.600]   It's what they honestly feel about it.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.520]   Social internet-based feedback, by contrast,
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.080]   has lots of other factors going on that is driving it.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.640]   It might not be a true representation
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.480]   about how people feel about something.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.380]   There's all sorts of other dynamics going on.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.260]   For example, if we isolate Twitter,
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.400]   the service that was pointed out by Chris Licht
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.920]   in the article we just looked at about CNN,
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.680]   we see that a lot of the really aggressive backlash
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.360]   or pushback on Twitter, whether it's coming
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.960]   from the far right or the far left,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.140]   is often about enforcing tribal boundaries,
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.720]   that there is a war going on where neither side
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.840]   wants their Overton window to shift at all
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.480]   towards the other side, and there'll be intense pressure
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.120]   to try to adjust or control what is said
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.080]   and what is not said.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.160]   If you look at backlash from the right or the left,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.080]   what you often see is that it doesn't correlate
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.360]   to how far have you drifted from orthodoxy.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.840]   Actually, the most intense pushback
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.520]   will be for people who are right at the border of orthodoxy
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.640]   'cause that's what matters,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.380]   is you don't want that Overton window border
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.280]   to shift a little bit in the opposite direction.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.640]   So if you're largely on a team
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.260]   and then drift a little bit towards the other team,
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.240]   that's gonna get a lot more attention
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.080]   than let's say that you're wildly against
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.760]   what a particular team feels for.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.720]   Whatever value judgment you wanna give to those dynamics,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.880]   what we can say is that it's not an accurate
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.280]   representative view of how people actually feel.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.960]   There's other dynamics going on.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.720]   There's also retribution that happens in Twitter.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.040]   There's also amplification of straight up crazy people.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.120]   So bad faith information you're getting from the internet.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.960]   Now this has a real problem.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.920]   And the reason why, and Chris Licht is saying,
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.740]   "Stop looking at backlash from Twitter."
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.040]   The reason why the managing editor at the New York Times,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.600]   as we covered last month, said the same thing to his writers,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.120]   "Stop using Twitter, stop paying attention to Twitter,"
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.200]   is because let's say you're a reporter,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.760]   you take this feedback really seriously
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.480]   because we're wired to take feedback seriously
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.560]   and it can push how you report into weird directions.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.260]   It's actually not optimal for the information,
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.160]   but it's the hijacking of our feedback apparatus.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.520]   The same thing can happen to the rest of us as well.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.960]   Reporters are not.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.760]   You get that bias sample, bad faith feedback
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.480]   from the internet and it can really affect
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.020]   the way you feel, the way you act,
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.960]   what you talk about, what you produce,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.940]   how you live your life.
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.940]   It is the hijacking of the human feedback apparatus
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.600]   by a source of corrupted feedback
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.300]   that our brain never evolved to expect.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.520]   So I think we need to be very careful about this.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.280]   We all need to do a similar survey in our own lives,
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.180]   similar to what the New York Times
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.560]   or the CNN seems to be doing now
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.600]   and saying, "Let's be careful about
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.960]   what we pay attention to."
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.480]   Now a bad solution here would be to stop seeking feedback
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.640]   for our ideas and actions altogether.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.500]   'Cause again, we're wired for feedback.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.180]   It serves a good purpose.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.100]   There's a common effect that academics know about.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.500]   I call it retired academic syndrome,
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.820]   where you get a very smart academic
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:20.660]   that's existing in the high energy,
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.580]   constant feedback, back and forth discussion world
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.640]   of their academic field.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.340]   And then for whatever reason, they leave academia.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.180]   They're very smart people, but they leave academia
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.000]   seven times out of 10, especially if they have
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.740]   some sort of public facing discussion,
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.740]   they will start to drift into increasingly extreme ideas,
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.720]   different topics, but they'll get to extremely weird ideas
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.400]   or they'll get very cantankerous or they'll get very upset.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.560]   And part of what's happening here is they're very smart,
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.920]   but they get separated from the feedback mechanism
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.880]   that helps them push back and adjust and modify and improve
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.440]   and keep reasonable their thinking
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.220]   and they end up going crazy.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.640]   So again, feedback is important.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.480]   We don't want to ignore it,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.960]   we don't want the internet to drive it.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.640]   So the solution I wanna suggest is to create your own,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.720]   what we can call feedback councils.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.600]   So this is a group of people that you trust
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.880]   that have been in your life for a while,
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.200]   that have a variety of backgrounds and expertises.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.360]   So if you are a tech bro in Silicon Valley,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.160]   your feedback council should not be six other Stanford grads
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.720]   who are roughly your same age and gender and what have you.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.320]   You want a backgrounds that represent things
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.960]   that you might not be exposed to.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.400]   And then take the opinion of this council seriously
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.040]   on decisions in your life, ideas you're writing
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.940]   or trying to put out there, just your personal understanding.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.800]   How do I understand this big news event that's happening?
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.400]   So take that high engineered,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.320]   high quality source of feedback very seriously,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.920]   allow it to adjust the way you think and move.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.160]   But then here's the key thing,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.260]   ignore other arbitrary sources of feedback.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.940]   Ignore if you're a public facing figure,
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.920]   random comments from Twitter, angry direct messages,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.100]   those weird emails.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.520]   If you have engineered a high quality feedback council,
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.780]   you're gonna get a variety of good feedback.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.280]   If they're on board with something
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.440]   then and it feels right for you, run with it.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.040]   If they're nervous about an idea,
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.320]   they say, I don't think that's good for you,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.240]   take that seriously.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.260]   If they say, hey, this thing you're writing about,
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.200]   I don't think you realize that it's gonna come across
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.400]   to people like me as being kind of dismissive or offensive,
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.580]   take that seriously.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.440]   Now, I think companies should do the same thing
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.880]   at a much larger scale.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.080]   They should have large representative panels of people
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.920]   that are relevant to what their company does,
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.280]   their stakeholder, their customers,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.800]   their shareholders, et cetera.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.080]   They should take the feedback from this very seriously.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.440]   And the flip side is they should ignore Twitter.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.200]   And they should ignore random emails or direct messages.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.840]   Politicians should do the same thing.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.280]   You should be very in touch with a representative sample
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.120]   of your constituents.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.840]   You should be talking to your constituents.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.400]   You should be doing town halls,
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   be getting the mood of actual people out there,
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.980]   but ignore what angry 27 year olds
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.360]   with too much time on their hands
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.840]   are repeatedly tweeting at you.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.960]   That's not real life.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.440]   That's bias, that's bad faith.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.720]   You need feedback.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   Your brain craves feedback, but it's gotta be good.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.540]   So anyways, that is my idea.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.360]   Something we don't talk enough about,
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.200]   our brains take feedback seriously.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.040]   The social internet and a particular social media
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.360]   can pervert or corrupt those sources of feedback.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.480]   So we have to be very careful about replacing those
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.420]   with sources of feedback that we trust.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.440]   So there's my concept.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.760]   - So for people with not a whole lot of diversity
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.320]   in their social console, what do you suggest?
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.180]   - Yeah, so you have to try to seek out as much as you can.
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.160]   So yeah, let's say your friend group is--
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.000]   - Kind of small.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.920]   - Yeah, and homogenous.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.320]   See if there's maybe through at work or through family,
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.200]   or a cousin, or you do the best you can.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.120]   But I think you wanna mix, in a perfect world,
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.560]   there's a lot of things you wanna,
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.400]   most people aren't gonna be able to have
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.280]   this many different factors.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.000]   But in a perfect world, the things that I think matter is,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.520]   so professional background matters, right?
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.840]   So if you had class variety, I think that would be useful.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.920]   So it's not just, let me talk to a bunch of other
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.360]   dual income, upper middle class, government worker families.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.960]   Like, can I talk to someone who has a completely different
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.400]   type of job?
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.660]   Geographic diversity probably matters.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.000]   I think people feel differently if you live in a suburb,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.680]   in the middle of a city, in the country, that might matter.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.880]   I would say gender and racial identity
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.920]   probably really matters.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.280]   I mean, gender obviously is a huge one.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.720]   Women and men think very differently about things
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.680]   and don't always understand each other.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.980]   And then probably age.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.400]   You know, like you have a sampling of people
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.600]   from different age.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.000]   You're not gonna hit all of those probably, in one group.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.080]   But having some sorts of feedback.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.480]   Now, you know, I kind of cheat that a little bit.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   I use informally long time reader/listeners.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.100]   You know, like this is the nice thing about my online world.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.520]   It's been around for a long time.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.840]   Starting with the blog and then it turned
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.760]   to an email newsletter.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.080]   Now we have the podcast.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.200]   But it's not huge.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.620]   And it's not, it doesn't have a big social media presence.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.640]   I don't interact with people on social media.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.060]   And so the group of people who send me emails
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.760]   or comment on blog posts, and you see their messages,
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.800]   it feels close knit, you know?
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.520]   It somehow has escaped the dynamics.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.960]   And I think, I shouldn't say somehow,
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.780]   I know exactly why.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.160]   It's because all this interaction is happening
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.560]   in the absence of social media.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.080]   With all of those weird incentives it has.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   If all your content's in social media,
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.040]   then you can find these weird bias samples of feedback
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.300]   where your content moves through amplification networks
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.720]   and gets to some corner of people who are upset at you.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.040]   But when you're not on social media,
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.520]   it's a much tighter knit audience.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.960]   And it's really interestingly diverse.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.860]   Different countries, different backgrounds,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.540]   different types of jobs, working class, non-working class,
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.820]   all sorts of different racial identities.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.080]   And I get all sorts of interesting feedback from people.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.160]   And so it's my secret weapon, I think,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.980]   is that I have this cabal of really interesting people
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.420]   that's small enough that it's a pretty good sample.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.080]   And I would say our crazy to normal ratio is really small.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.220]   We occasionally get some crazies,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.940]   but we don't get that much crazy.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.580]   - Do you know any retired professors
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.380]   who have taken, done this?
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.580]   Did not go crazy?
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.420]   - They should.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.300]   It really is common.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.420]   The problem with being a professor is you're smart,
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.620]   so you can convince yourself.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.660]   It's completely reasonable to you.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.220]   That's why they get conspiratorial.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.720]   It's completely reasonable to you
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.860]   that you could figure something out
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.540]   that no one else understands.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.100]   And if you don't have that feedback saying,
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.100]   yeah, that might be true,
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.460]   but you've kind of gone off the deep end on this one.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.660]   Without that type of feedback,
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.980]   they end up in crazy places.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.080]   Like being smart is a problem
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.060]   when it comes to conspiratorial or weird thinking.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.860]   They either get conspiratorial
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.260]   or they get cantankerous
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.900]   and just kind of mad at everyone.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.180]   So if I ever retire from academia,
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.580]   once I start, if I start going on about contrails
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.580]   and radio transmissions in my fillings,
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.940]   someone's got to intervene.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.980]   (upbeat music)
