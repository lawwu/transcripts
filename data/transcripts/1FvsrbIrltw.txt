[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   so there's a myth that coca-cola at one point had cocaine in it not just the coca leaf but
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.760]   actual cocaine but then you hear various versions of this myth slash legend what's the deal with
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.060]   coca-cola the coca leaf and cocaine yeah so it's a it's a great old story i had john pemberton was
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:32.400]   a pharmacist in atlanta home of coca-cola these days and developed a formula that contained the
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:43.220]   coca leaf extract from the coca leaf and extract from the cola nut so coca-cola and put this together
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.000]   sold it as a tonic it's an interesting just a quick segue on soft drinks in general so soft drinks came
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.700]   about because they weren't hard drinks so it was an alternative to liquor so they weren't hard
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.120]   alcohol they were soft drinks or soft beverages they also generally had effervescence to them or
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.720]   carbonation and most of those were available at a pharmacist soda fountain so 7up had lithium in it
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.540]   in the past and it was um you know for mind wellness um pepsi had pepsinogen which is a digestive peptide
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.540]   in it um most of the soft drinks dr pepper was developed by dr pepper in waco texas and was a
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.740]   special formula that he had come up with for well-being as well so all these soft drinks have a
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.460]   really cool history but john pemberton's story of coca-cola was it actually goes way back further than
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.520]   coca-cola in terms of putting uh coca leaf into beverages um but we'll we'll just stick with coca-cola
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:57.400]   so coca-cola um definitely had cocaine in it in in its original setting um and then as time went on
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.360]   and we realized that cocaine was problematic and addictive um there was pressure for him to take
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.480]   that out of of the process and so and what they realized was the coca leaf in in many people that
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.520]   chew coca leaf talk about the different varieties that are available within south uh america and
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.640]   different flavor profiles that are there well the the specific um one that they use for coca-cola has a
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:36.060]   a definitive flavor profile to it and when they took that out it lost the flavor that people were used
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.800]   to um and so they they decided to keep this in there and coca-cola is still the major importer of coca
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.280]   leaves into the united states to this day they do it through a company called the stepan company in new jersey
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:00.120]   the leaf comes from peru uh comes from a state-run company in peru that oversees the production of the coca leaf
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:09.840]   comes into uh this company in new jersey they then process the leaf into um two parts so they take all of the
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.660]   cocaine and all of the cocaine metabolites essentially the alkaloids right we talked about these alkaloids
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.660]   they take the alkaloids out and that gets sent to a pharmaceutical company and those are processed
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.080]   into cocaine which is used as a pharmaceutical still to this day
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.080]   uh a lot of people probably don't know this but cocaine is the best local anesthetic that's ever
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.920]   been discovered uh it was the template for all the local anesthetics that we use now like lidocaine
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.240]   or bapivacaine um it was the template and it is still the best one that we have and it's used almost
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.480]   exclusively for nasal and eye surgeries now where you have to stay awake and you have to be functioning and we
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.920]   we can't intubate you and we can't do these things so this is the ideal uh drug um it's also obviously
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.720]   put into lots of drug testing kits and supplies and whatnot for for the forensics industries
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:15.360]   but what's the fate of what's left right well that coca leaf extract the dealkalinated extract
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:25.680]   decoconized extract if you will um is the secret sauce if you will for coca-cola still so that is a
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:34.800]   grass substance a gras generally recognized as safe food substance and that is the flavoring agent that
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.600]   gives coca-cola its unique flavor and there was a period of time i believe is in the 80s where coca-cola
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:50.400]   really wanted to distance itself from the cocaine industry cocaine became hugely the drug of choice
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.640]   sort of drug of abuse len bias one nba basketball player died from overdose it just became a very
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.440]   nationally uh aware drug of abuse and there was a problem associated with cocaine and so coca-cola
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.120]   said we're gonna cut our ties with the coca plant completely they came out with this product called new
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.960]   coke and it didn't last long because the flavor profile couldn't be replicated to the old coke and
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:28.000]   so indeed they re uh re-upped their their sort of contract uh and have been bringing it in ever since
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.360]   and to this day coca-cola classic and coke zero are the two products interestingly enough um you know diet
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.560]   coke does not taste very much like coca-cola original and a lot of people complained about that for a long
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.160]   time um they got smart and made this product called coke zero that has the flavoring agent from the coca
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:58.000]   plant in it and lo and behold everyone started saying gosh this tastes a lot more like coca-cola does well
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.640]   yeah it's got the flavoring ingredient in it and so everybody in the united states almost has had a
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:12.560]   coke at one point at a time so you've all had coca leaf already in your dietary chain and i think it'll
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.840]   be interesting to see where things develop as we start to do more research as the world health organization
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:29.120]   and reconsiders um removing uh coca leaf from an international ban and and looking at it as a potential product
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:37.760]   to work into food products and develop um further and so you know it supposedly has no abuse potential as the leaf
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:46.400]   but again it's that story of isolating that one alkaloid out and sort of destroying the rest of it
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:54.240]   forever however coca-cola was smart enough to keep sort of a monopoly if you will on on keeping that plant
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:02.400]   alive uh in their product and so it's it's there and um the next time you have a coca-cola or coke zero
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.800]   just realized that it's got natural product in it that's incredible and i'll keep that in mind the next
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:19.440]   time i have a coke zero is there any evidence that what's still retained from the coca plant in coca-cola
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.320]   is psychoactive and not just there for flavor that's a great question and that's been debated quite a bit
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.160]   so the one thing that we know um is that probably it is not having any psychoactivity
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.920]   um and the the other thing that we know um back to my pharmacy days we used to sell coke syrup so
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:49.040]   when coke is sold uh for fountain beverages um it's it's the syrup that's then blended with the carbonated
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:55.360]   water uh to make coca-cola and that's why a lot of people say coca-cola out of a fountain is so much
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.840]   better than out of a can or a bottle because it is it is a sort of formulated on the spot product if you
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:12.720]   will uh yeah on tap and um coke syrup we used to sell out of the pharmacy for uh nausea and vomiting
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.120]   particularly in pregnant women is one of the safest things you could use and it really calms and settles
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:29.280]   the gi tract and this is interesting because one of the big um benefits that people report drinking coca
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:37.600]   tea is that it soothes their gi tract and it calms their gi tract and it helps um them be able to be
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:46.160]   alert of course the coca tea's got all the alkaloids in it but that same gi tract benefit is still still there
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:54.720]   and that's probably what's still remaining within that extract that's now devoid of of the alkaloids
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:03.280]   and you are not paid for by coca-cola no in fact we went to coca-cola to see if we could work um with
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:12.400]   them on developing uh some type of medications or or something from the coca leaf and i have a former
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:19.040]   colleague that is in their natural products division at coca-cola and they said they won't even let us
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.800]   touch the the coca extract and they've also got all that cocaine that they've pulled out of the coca
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.880]   leaf in this plant in new jersey i can only imagine what the security is on this place i don't i don't
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:37.200]   know but if you you know you can you can fact check me on wikipedia or or which is not a great place to
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:44.240]   fact check but uh you got my agreement there but this the stepan company is listed there in new jersey and
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.520]   their connection to coca-cola and this whole this whole story is actually out there in front of
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:58.080]   everybody to see um it just takes knowing where to look and find it love it last question about soda
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:07.440]   is there still lithium and 7up no lithium has gone from 7up but that was the whole idea right up mood
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:14.880]   lift your mood up and lithium and we know lithium carbonate is still used to this day as a treatment
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:25.760]   for uh psychosis so
