[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   I would like to call attention once more to the words which are to be found in Paul's
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.840]   epistle to the Ephesians in the sixth chapter, verses 10 to 13.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.120]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:30.280]   Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.280]   devil.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.440]   For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.040]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   places.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.520]   Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.500]   evil day, and having done all, to stand."
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.120]   We come back once more to this most important and, in many ways, at the present time, crucial
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.520]   statement by the apostle here at the end of this great epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.480]   And at the moment in particular, we are engaged upon a study and an investigation of what
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.440]   the apostle describes here as the wiles of the devil.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.460]   There is nothing more important for Christian people than that they should know something
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.460]   about this.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.320]   Otherwise, we shall be defeated and brought into a state of misery and of bondage, and
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.600]   great harm may result to the whole life of the Christian Church.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.560]   Now we have divided up this subject in this way.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.520]   There are very clearly indicated in the New Testament and in the subsequent history of
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.360]   the Christian Church certain general manifestations of the wiles of the devil.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:05.480]   I mean by that that he has exerted himself in such a way as to produce movements in the
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.020]   life of the Church as a whole, which has brought much disaster and trouble.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.520]   And then the second grouping is the wiles of the devil as manifested in a more personal
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.480]   manner in the life of the individual Christian.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.320]   Now both these aspects are of importance for us.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.520]   Let nobody think that this first aspect is irrelevant for the individual Christian.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.040]   I pause with that point for a moment for this reason, that it does seem to me that there
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.760]   is an increasing tendency today for people to think of the Church as a whole, as being
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.440]   something that appertains only to Church leaders, and that it has nothing to do with the individual
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.720]   Christian.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.520]   The great leaders go around the world from conference to conference, and they decide
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.560]   what happens to the Church.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.800]   And the individual member tends to divorce himself from that, and feel that that is not
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   within his province at all.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.900]   Now that, as the New Testament shows very clearly, is very wrong and very false.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.840]   And it is particularly so in churches which do not have a hierarchical or episcopal system
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.160]   of Church government.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.600]   Ultimately, the power of decision is in the hands of the individual Church members who
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.480]   express their views in their verse.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.240]   So it may well be that the ignorance of the individual Church member concerning these
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.880]   matters may be responsible ultimately for some serious error or heresy or even division
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.760]   in the ranks of the Christian Church.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.920]   No, we are meant to understand the doctrine of the Church as a whole, and we are to feel
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.720]   responsible for the state of the Church as a whole, as well as for our individual position
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   and situation.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.680]   It is a very sad day in the life and history of the Church when people atomize, as it were,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.760]   the whole state of the Church, and come to God's house only concerned about themselves
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.880]   and their own personal moods and states and feelings and problems.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.960]   We are responsible for the whole as well as for ourselves.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.520]   The whole teaching of that twelfth chapter of 1 Corinthians, which we read just now,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.120]   surely should bring us all to see the rightness of such an emphasis.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.080]   Well now then, I say, we are looking at the moment at these general activities of the
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.560]   devil, the ways in which he manifests and shows his wiles and his subtleties with regard
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.280]   to the Church as a whole.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.440]   We have already considered the question of heresies, and last Sunday morning we considered
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:58.040]   the question of apostasy, and we did so in terms of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.640]   You will remember that the difference between those two things is this.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:11.840]   A heresy is a kind of doubt or denial of any defined Christian doctrine.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:21.920]   It does not involve the whole; it is some particular error or doubt or difficulty, whereas
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.920]   apostasy means a general departure from the Christian faith and teaching.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.440]   And we tried to show how the Roman Church is guilty of that in the ways that we indicated.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.840]   Now we come this morning to another manifestation of this general activity of the devil, the
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.640]   wiles of the devil shown in yet another manner in the Church as a whole.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.760]   And this is something which is clearly described and indicated in the New Testament, and which
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.240]   is seen very clearly in the subsequent history of the Christian Church.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.040]   I refer to the whole problem and question of schism.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.760]   Now this term schism means division.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.480]   It means a tearing, a tearing apart.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.760]   It means a rent-making, a cloak, or a bit of material.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.600]   That is the original, ultimate meaning of this word schism.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:35.280]   Now it is to be found in three places in the New Testament in particular, and they are
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.920]   all in that first epistle to the Corinthians, a portion of which we read at the beginning.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.360]   Now you notice that in the twelfth chapter which we read you have got the actual word
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.880]   schism itself.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:56.760]   On the twenty-fifth verse the apostle says that there should be no schism in the body,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.600]   but that the members should have the same care one for another.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.720]   But exactly the same word was used by the apostle in two other places in that first
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.120]   epistle to the Corinthians, though it is translated by a different word in our translations.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.840]   It is in the tenth verse of the first chapter.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.400]   Now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak the
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.880]   same thing, that there be no divisions among you.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.160]   Now that should be that there be no schisms among you.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.760]   It is exactly the same word as you have got there in chapter twelve in verse twenty-five.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:44.560]   And again you have got another example of it in chapter eleven and in verse eighteen.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.640]   For first of all, says the apostle, when ye come together in the church, he is dealing
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.040]   here with the question of the communion.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.080]   For first of all when ye come together in the church I hear that there be divisions
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   among you.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.120]   It is the same word, it is the word schisms.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:07.200]   I hear that there be schisms among you, and I partly believe it.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.960]   Now this is therefore the condition with which we are going to deal.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.680]   I can't help feeling that it is somehow significant that in the hymn which we have
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.960]   just been singing a verse has been omitted, which you will find in some of the older hymn
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.520]   books and which is very much to the point.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:34.080]   It reads like this, "Though with a scornful wonder men see her sore oppressed, by schisms
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.280]   rent asunder, by heresies distressed."
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.280]   Now that is omitted.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.880]   I can't help feeling I say that it's got some sort of significance.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.760]   Why was that omitted?
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.160]   Well I think the answer partly is what we were considering a fortnight ago, that people
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.520]   no longer tend to recognize heresies.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.680]   And it's because of this loose thinking and the whole notion of heresies disliked
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.480]   because it involves discipline, and it's an age which hates discipline.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.880]   It's an age of laxity and of looseness and of license.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.680]   And it comes out, you see, even in the matter of selecting what stanzas you put into a hymn.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.360]   However, there it is.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.960]   That is what we are considering.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:26.620]   Now this, as I have indicated, is a subject that is dealt with in the New Testament.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:33.300]   That first epistle to the Corinthians was written almost entirely to deal with the question
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.140]   of schism.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.800]   You remember it's one of those omnibus epistles.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.000]   The apostle doesn't so much sit down as it were to write or to dictate a letter giving
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.880]   instruction as he does in the case of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.800]   No, he's had a number of letters and of messages from the church at Corinth.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:55.280]   It was a church that was in great trouble, divided up in various ways, and the apostle
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.140]   writes in order to show them the wrongness of these divisions.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:05.040]   It is the classical epistle on this whole subject of schism.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.280]   And as I hope to show you, you will find it running as a theme through the entire epistle.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.840]   But you will find it also in the other epistles.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:21.280]   There are odd references to it, glances at it, almost in every one of the New Testament
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.600]   writings.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.560]   So that it was a problem that arose at the very beginning in the life of the Christian
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560]   church.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.080]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:41.160]   Well, it means a kind of division coming into the life of the Christian church, a division
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:48.000]   that should never be there, a natural, wrong division in the life of the church.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.620]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:56.320]   It is a state and condition of the church in which she no longer conforms to our Lord's
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:05.760]   prayer recorded in John 17, 21, where we read that he prayed that they all may be one, as
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:13.440]   thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.880]   may believe that thou hast sent me.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.920]   Now, schism is the exact opposite of that.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:30.220]   It is a state in which the church is wrongly divided, the opposite of John 17, 21, a state
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:39.980]   in which you've got factions, groups, and divisions in the body of the Christian church.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:48.260]   Now I'm most anxious to make it clear that this is a vital subject for all of us.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.320]   You can't understand your New Testament properly if you don't understand this doctrine.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:59.700]   As I say, it's explicit in one Corinthians, it's implicit in almost every epistle.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.820]   So in order to understand the New Testament, we must know something about this.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.920]   And when you come to the subsequent history of the Christian church, well, you won't begin
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.240]   to understand it.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.920]   If you don't know exactly what is meant by schism, the history of the church, alas, is
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.520]   full of this very thing that we're looking at.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.160]   And if you lacked any other reason, the one given by our Lord in that great high priestly
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.000]   prayer of his surely should be enough.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.640]   Why should we be concerned about this?
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.160]   For this reason, the world outside, he says, is looking on.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.040]   That's why he prays that they all may be one, even as he and the Father are one, that the
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.800]   world may know that thou hast sent me.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.620]   The world is looking on at the Christian church, and there can be no question at all but that
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:58.120]   schisms and divisions do constitute an obstacle and a hindrance to those who are outside from
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.080]   believing and submitting themselves to the Christian faith and the Christian teaching.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.040]   Very well, then, I say this should be an urgent metaphor at all.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.920]   We see the world, we see the majority outside the church in this country.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.720]   Therefore, this is a matter, I say, that should be at the center of all our thinking.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.640]   Well now then, let's look at it.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:29.680]   Here again we see the extreme subtlety and wiliness of the devil.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:40.160]   Nowhere perhaps is his subtle art and artistry and artfulness shown so clearly as in the
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:50.080]   way in which he drives us as Christian people to overcorrection and to extremes.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.320]   Now let me show you what I mean.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.180]   Take for instance the relationship of this matter of schism to what we've been considering
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:05.280]   on the two previous Sundays—heresy, apostasy, as shown in the Roman Catholic Church or in
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   any other form.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:12.600]   Now, I want to show you the extreme subtlety and wiliness of the devil.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.800]   This is how it works.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.700]   Fortnight ago we were here considering the danger of heresy.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.840]   We were showing the terrible danger of this attitude that is so common today, an attitude
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.800]   of what we may call indifferentism, by which we mean this.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.400]   This popular ecumenical teaching so-called, which rarely says, "It doesn't matter what
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.360]   you believe, as long as you're a Christian, as long as you're standing against communism,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.520]   as long as you somehow believe in God, it doesn't matter what you believe.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.120]   You mustn't be particular about these doctrines."
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.960]   Now we were showing the danger of all that, how that leads of necessity to heresy.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.880]   If you have no standard, you can't judge anything to be wrong.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.280]   You'll never know where you are, but everything will be all right, and on you go.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.120]   There is nothing more dangerous than that.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.800]   And we spent time in showing that.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.200]   Then last Sunday, in exactly the same way, we were looking at apostasy, and we saw that
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.000]   there is nothing more important than for us to denounce apostasy and to separate ourselves
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   from it.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Very well.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.760]   The thing was clear.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.480]   There were the pictures, and we saw it so clearly.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.280]   Now then, the devil comes in at that point, he says, "Perfectly right.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.320]   Heresy is something terrible, and you must separate yourself from it.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   Apostasy is worse.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.120]   You must get as far away from apostasy as you possibly can."
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   "You're quite right," says the devil, "this can never be overemphasized.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.360]   You can never be too careful and punctilious about all this."
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.240]   And he presses it, and he presses it, and he presses it, until we've gone so far away
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:58.040]   from heresy and from apostasy that we begin to divide when we shouldn't divide, and
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.160]   separate when we shouldn't separate.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.600]   Now that is what is meant by scissor.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.000]   Now this is the problem, therefore, I say for us today.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.320]   You see, in the Christian life, you are always, as someone as well put it, walking as it were
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.320]   on a knife edge.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.880]   There's a great chasm there, there's another one here.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:28.600]   And the Christian is a man who has always got to avoid certain extremes, and this is
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.680]   the task for the Christian, and especially at the present time.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:40.760]   How are we to draw the line between allowing heresy and apostasy?
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.640]   On the one hand, being guilty of schism on the other hand.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.560]   Now those who belong to the Roman Catholic Church say that all of us who are Protestants
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.880]   are schismatics, and that we are guilty of schism.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.340]   That's what the Roman Church says about us this morning.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.080]   We are guilty, they say, of schism.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.440]   That is because we are not still in the Roman Church.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.960]   How do we demonstrate to them that we are not guilty of schism, but that it is they
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.360]   who are guilty of apostasy?
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   That's the problem.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.040]   And it's exactly the same, I say, with this whole modern tendency to have one great world
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.400]   church, believe what you like, don't be too particular about these definitions of
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.440]   faith and of doctrine.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:30.920]   How do we walk on this narrow ledge between that and, on the other hand, being guilty
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.920]   of schism?
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.040]   Or let me put it to you like this.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.800]   There's a very good statement concerning all this matter in the second epistle of
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.000]   John in verse 10.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.960]   John says there, "If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.040]   him not into your house, neither bid him Godspeed."
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.240]   John is saying quite explicitly that there were certain false teachers in the early church
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   who were not preaching the true doctrine of Christ.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.760]   "Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.280]   He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.680]   If therefore there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.280]   your house, neither bid him Godspeed."
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.800]   Now, there's one side, isn't it?
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.840]   We are not to have fellowship with these people who don't hold the true doctrine.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.800]   There it is quite explicitly.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.520]   It's in many other places in the New Testament.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.080]   A man who's not clear about the doctrine of the person and the work of the Lord Jesus
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.640]   Christ is a man who's to be avoided.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.680]   We are not to receive him into our church, into our house.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.640]   We are not to bid him Godspeed.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.000]   It's wrong to do so.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   There's one side.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.960]   Yes, but you see, in your desire to do that and to be right at that point, the devil will
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   come and will drive you so far to the other extreme that you become guilty of the sin
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.600]   of schism.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:10.200]   And remember, the sin of schism is condemned in the New Testament quite as much as is the
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.480]   sin of heresy or of apostasy.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.320]   It is a terrible sin.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.120]   And therefore, we have to discover the position between these two things, and that is the
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.560]   task that is before us this morning.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.960]   When is it right to separate?
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.040]   When is it wrong to separate?
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:35.960]   Now, if we don't recognize the two things, we're already in a false position.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.820]   The only way to answer this question is to consider the New Testament teaching concerning
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.480]   this whole matter of schism.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:50.080]   I do want you to keep in your minds this whole question of the wiles of the devil, and especially
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.640]   perhaps those who rejoiced most of all last Sunday morning and the previous Sunday morning.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.960]   Now, this is your morning.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:05.280]   Those who denounce the Roman Catholic Church, and those who denounce the ecumenical movement,
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   and so on.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.660]   Now then, this is for you.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:14.680]   It is you especially that the devil is likely to attack with all his wiles and subtlety,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.000]   because of the clarity of your understanding concerning the two previous doctrines.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.440]   You are the very person that he'll take, and he'll drive you so far in that direction
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.400]   that you will have fallen into the sin of schism.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.560]   Very well then, how do we define schism?
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.000]   I suggest a division like this.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.120]   Schism is division without an adequate cause.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:47.440]   Or if you like, schism is division for most inadequate reasons.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.000]   Very well, now let's look at it like this.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.920]   I suggest that the classical statement about this is really that John 17, 21, that I've
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.080]   already read.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:07.080]   I know of no verse at the present time that is so misunderstood, so utterly abused and
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.560]   misused as John 17, 21.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   Listen to it.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.600]   "That they all may be one as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:26.040]   be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me."
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.040]   Now, how is that verse being interpreted today?
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.320]   Well, you're familiar.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.600]   This is the interpretation.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.440]   Here we are, they say, that's what our Lord prayed for.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.440]   And that is the greatest need today.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:45.200]   They say the greatest sin in the world today is a disunited church.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.880]   There's the enemy, there's the world looking on, and she sees a divided church.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.920]   They say there's only one thing for us to do, we must all come together, we must unite
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.920]   at all costs.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.640]   They say our Lord prayed for that, that they all might be one.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.600]   They say, why are you holding on to this particular doctrine?
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.680]   Why do you say that a man must believe in the virgin birth?
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.160]   Why must he believe in the miracles of our Lord?
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.040]   Why must he believe in the substitution of the atonement?
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.960]   Why must he believe in the literal physical resurrection?
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.000]   Why must he believe in the person of the Holy Spirit?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Why?
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.320]   With things as they are.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.920]   Surely, our Lord says that they all may be one.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.520]   Any man who calls himself a Christian, we must be one, that the world may know that
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.520]   God has sent him.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.920]   Now that's the interpretation that's being given, isn't it?
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.800]   But you see, it's entirely false.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.920]   That isn't what our Lord is saying there at all.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:42.960]   What he is saying is this, he is praying that his followers may be kept from the sin of
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   schism.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   What's that?
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.240]   It's this.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:58.120]   His disciples for whom our Lord was praying all believed exactly the same things.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.840]   There was no disagreement on doctrine amongst the apostles for whom Christ was praying.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.400]   He has already said that.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.720]   He has in his prayer reminded his father that these were the men who had believed his teaching.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.440]   He says, I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.720]   They were and thou gavest to me and they have kept thy word.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.360]   Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.840]   I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.600]   have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.580]   me.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:41.480]   These were men who were absolutely agreed about all the doctrines.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.200]   There was no trouble there.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.160]   They were doctrinally one.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160]   What is he praying for?
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.720]   Well, what he's praying for is this, that nothing may come in and separate and divide
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:24:00.680]   these men from one another who are absolutely agreed about the truth and the doctrines.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.160]   You see, it is the very reverse of the use that is being made at the present time of
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.400]   John 17.21.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.700]   Our Lord was not praying that they all might hang together, though they might disagree
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.000]   about cardinal doctrines.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.100]   No, no.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.860]   What he's saying is this, "Oh, I pray that these men who are agreed about cardinal doctrines
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.760]   may never separate for any other reason."
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.320]   You see, it's the exact opposite.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.720]   Our Lord was not making a great plea for ecumenicity.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.800]   He was praying that the disciples may be saved from schism.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.200]   Very well.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.120]   There, I say, is the key to the understanding of all this matter.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.740]   If you like a further one, we've already had it in this great epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740]   Take the fourth chapter.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:49.520]   Here is the apostle saying at the beginning, "I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:56.600]   you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness,
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:04.600]   with longsuffering, forbearing one another, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.120]   in the bond of peace."
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.640]   Now there are foolish people at the present time who interpret that in the wrong way.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.280]   "Ah, you see," they say, "Paul doesn't teach there that we should all believe the same
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   thing.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.200]   He is concerned about the unity of the Spirit.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.680]   Let's all get together.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.080]   Let's work together.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.360]   And then, as we work together and exercise this loving Christian spirit, perhaps we'll
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.840]   draw a little bit nearer together in our doctrines and in what we believe."
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.160]   That's the use, isn't it?
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.360]   No, the apostle says the exact opposite.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.840]   You see, the apostle in the first three chapters has been laying down the cardinal doctrines,
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.480]   and they're all agreed about these.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.480]   What is he saying then?
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:50.040]   Well, he says, "I pray that you all may be kept there in that unity, with all lowliness
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040]   and meekness."
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.840]   You see, the danger is not so much that they'll go wrong with their doctrine there, but that
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.720]   they'll go wrong in the matter of pride or self-esteem.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:03.640]   He prays they may be kept low and meek, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.840]   not on matters of doctrine, but on, as we shall see, on matters of personality and a
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.760]   thousand and one other things.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:16.120]   He says, "Endeavoring not to form a unity, but to keep the unity, to safeguard it, to
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.480]   preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.280]   And then he says, "There is, of course, only one body and one Spirit, even as ye are
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.760]   called in one hope of your calling.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.160]   One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is above all and through
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   all and in you all."
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:42.480]   So again, what the apostle is concerned about is not that people may vaguely and loosely
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.440]   come together, some believing in the virgin birth and some not, some believing in the
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.360]   substitution, reattainment, and others regarding it just as a manifestation of love.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.920]   No, no.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:00.320]   He is praying that men who are agreed and who are one in doctrine may be kept like that
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.640]   and not allow anything to separate them or to divide them.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:09.920]   It is again, I say, a warning against the terrible danger of schism.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:16.680]   Very well then, realizing that this is the controlling principle, let me now give you
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:27.240]   some practical individual illustrations of how one may fall into this sin of schism.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:33.080]   What are the matters concerning which it is wrong to divide?
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.680]   Well let us look at them as they are given to us in the New Testament.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:43.720]   First, it is very wrong to divide over persons and over personalities.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.920]   Here it is, of course, in its classical statement in the first chapter of the first epistle
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   to the Corinthians.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:55.200]   "I beseech you, brethren," I am reading at verse 10 again, "by the name of our Lord
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.000]   Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you, but
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.920]   that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   Why does he say that?
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.480]   Here is the answer.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:13.040]   "For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.520]   of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.200]   What were they contending about?
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.500]   The person of Christ?
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.140]   The meaning of the death of Christ?
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.140]   Not at all.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.680]   "There are contentions among you."
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680]   About what?
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.400]   "Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul."
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.300]   Another says, "I am of Apollos."
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.040]   And another says, "I am of Cephas."
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.760]   And another, "I am of Christ."
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.560]   They were dividing and separating about persons.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.880]   There was no disagreement about the cardinal central doctrines.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.080]   That was not the trouble in Corinth.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.280]   The trouble was over these persons.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.080]   Some people said, "Paul is the man.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   That is the preacher I like.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   There is nobody like him."
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   And so on.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   "Oh, silly old man, nonsense.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   Haven't you heard of Apollos?"
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   Why, Paul may have been a clever man, but he was a very poor speaker.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.400]   In any case, he was nothing to look at.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.760]   His presence was weak and his speech contemptible.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.760]   "Nonsense," they said.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.760]   "Apollos was the man.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.520]   A handsome fellow, didn't you hear him?
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.120]   And learned in the Scriptures, eloquent, moving, mighty."
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.600]   Well, I am very glad that you are laughing, because you are laughing at yourselves.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.760]   That is precisely what people are still doing in the Christian Church.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.520]   It is most interesting.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.920]   Paul and Apollos and Cephas and Christ.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:48.480]   Now, that is a perfect illustration of what is meant by schism.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:59.960]   Here were men who were believing in the same Lord, dividing the Church because of a carnal,
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:06.080]   unhealthy interest in persons and in personalities.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.560]   And the apostle therefore puts it like this.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.120]   He says, "What on earth are you doing?
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.080]   Is Christ divided?
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:17.920]   Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.640]   That is schism.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:24.920]   People who are agreed about the doctrine and about the truth, worshipping the same Christ,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:33.600]   dividing the Church, the body of Christ, over this unhealthy interest in persons and personalities.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.760]   The apostle Paul was able to say that he was not responsible for this.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.880]   He says, "I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius."
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.480]   He never set out to form a party.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.560]   He came in humility and in meekness, weakness, fear, and much trembling.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   He did not set himself up.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.880]   And any man who does that and tries to get a personal following is inciting people to
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.120]   the sin of schism.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.960]   It is a terrible sin.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.400]   This modern cult of personality, it is the higher order to schism.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:12.240]   How careful the apostle was to avoid that, and to give no suspicion that in any way he
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.160]   was guilty of leading people into that.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.760]   He did not want personal followers.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.760]   No, no.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.360]   But there it is.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:25.080]   You see, the moment you divide in the Christian Church over things like that, you are already
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.280]   guilty of schism.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.400]   Take another one.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:34.560]   I would put secondly what we may well call carnality.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.880]   What I mean by that is, of course, that we allow the flesh to come into these matters.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.040]   Not in exactly the same way as I have been considering, but in another way.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:49.500]   Take for instance that great and important incident in this respect, which is recorded
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.080]   at the end of the fifteenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   I will begin to read at verse thirty-six.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.520]   And some days after, Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.760]   every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   Excellent, wasn't it?
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:12.160]   And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:17.840]   But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia,
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.480]   and went not with them to the work.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.080]   And the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from another.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.200]   And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.480]   And Paul chose Silas and departed, being recommended by the brethren and to the grace of God.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.920]   Now there is another perfect instance of schism.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.760]   Paul and Barnabas absolutely agreed about the doctrines.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.280]   No division at all.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.320]   No question, no trouble whatsoever.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.000]   And yet they separate, they part from one another.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.600]   What was their duty?
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.240]   It was over the question of these men, John, Mark.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.000]   Barnabas wanted to take him with them.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Paul said no.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Why not?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.160]   Well, Paul said no for this reason, that they'd taken John Mark with them before, but that
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.720]   he'd deserted them.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   He'd left them.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.480]   When they needed him very much, he'd gone back.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.560]   So Paul said, "Well, I think it's wrong to take a man like this.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.040]   He's failed, he's proved himself unreliable.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.880]   Silas on the other hand is a good man.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   Let's take him."
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.080]   Now, Paul was arguing on facts.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.560]   Nevertheless, Barnabas wouldn't give in.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.000]   He was insisting upon taking John Mark with him.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Why?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.240]   Well, you know, there's only one answer.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.040]   John Mark happened to be Barnabas's nephew.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:33.640]   And because he was a blood relation, he stands out and the church is divided.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   That's Sism.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640]   Carnality.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.640]   The flesh coming in.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.240]   Oh, how often has it happened.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:46.240]   You see this in the Christian church and in a story so frequently, a man's called of God
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.480]   to do a work, then he's got a son.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.920]   The son has not been called to do the work and he hasn't the ability very often, but
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.400]   because he's a son, he's worked in, the position is so arranged that he must follow.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.040]   Much better men is there present and could do the work.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.520]   No, no, because he's the son of his father.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.480]   That's sure carnality.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.160]   And to cause division in the Christian church on those grounds is to be guilty of Sism.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   You've got the same thing in embryos, it were, in Philippians 1.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.640]   There were people in the church who were very jealous of the apostle Paul, rejoicing that
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.600]   he was in prison, preaching Christ of envy.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.760]   That's the same thing.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.040]   It often ends in this same disastrous position.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.560]   Well, think of many other examples and illustrations for yourself.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:38.880]   I've known churches divided purely for familial reasons, old family feuds have often divided
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.760]   the Christian church and brought terrible havoc.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.240]   See, it's nothing to do with the doctrine at all.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:49.200]   It's dividing on other grounds amongst people who are agreed about the doctrine.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.320]   Let me give you a third.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:57.960]   It really is, in a sense, a part of this carnality, but I think it deserves a heading for itself.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:07.120]   The desire to have the preeminence, masterfulness, the desire to be a leader and to be a dictator
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   in the church.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.800]   There's a classical illustration of this.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.240]   James and John, you remember, sent their mother to ask our Lord, "Should these two sons of
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.160]   hers be seated when he was in his glory in his kingdom, one on his right hand, one on
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   the left hand?"
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.880]   And of course, it created division.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.640]   We are told the other disciples were very annoyed with the two brothers, and rightly
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   so.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.800]   You see, the desire for preeminence, the desire to be important, to have a big place, to cut
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.640]   a big figure, is absolutely fatal.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.440]   They said, "Let us be put one on the right, one on the left."
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.240]   No doctrinal disagreement, but dividing in terms, again, of the desire for greatness
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.320]   and for importance.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.960]   You read the story of the church, keep your eyes open.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.360]   This thing is happening and has happened constantly.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.800]   It's sizzling, this devilish pride coming out in people.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:06.240]   There's perhaps the best statement of all concerning this, this time in the third epistle
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:14.080]   of John, where we've got a very good statement concerning it, concerning that man, Diotrephes,
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.960]   who is mentioned there by the apostle.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.960]   Listen.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:25.480]   Verse 9, "I wrote unto the church, but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them,
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.800]   receiveth us not."
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.000]   This man was causing division in the church, simply and solely because he wanted to be
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.600]   important and to have preeminence.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.640]   But you know, it happens in all sorts of ways.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:44.080]   Listen to Philippians 4, verse 2, "I beseech you, Odius, and beseech Syntike, that they
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.800]   be of the same mind in the Lord."
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   And then he goes on, "And I entreat thee also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.560]   with me in the gospel with Clement also."
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.560]   Now what was happening?
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.560]   Well, here it was.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.600]   Here were two excellent women in the church at Philippi, Eodius and Syntike.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.880]   They had been a great help to the apostle when he was there.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.000]   There was no difference amongst them as regards doctrine at all.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Well what was the trouble?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.600]   Well, it was personalities again.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.200]   We don't know which of them was to be blamed.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.840]   Perhaps both of them were to be blamed.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.560]   Eodius wanted to be the leading woman, so did Syntike.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.200]   And they were each pressing their claims, forming groups around them, and factions.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.000]   They were the leaders, importance, preeminence.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.640]   What a devilish thing it is.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.480]   The devil fell because of the same desire, you remember.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   He saw that.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   He lifted himself up.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.720]   It was his pride, his desire to be as great as God, to be above all else.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   There it is.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.200]   And it comes out, and that is Sism.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:49.160]   Nothing to do with doctrine, but just a desire to be great and self-important, and dividing
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.040]   the church on that.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.840]   Another cause of division, number four, is social status.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.840]   There is no doubt at all that in 1 Corinthians 11, the apostle is dealing with that quite
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.840]   specifically.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.480]   Now we are going to come to the communion table, and the apostle deals with it there.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.000]   Listen, that is how he puts it.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.600]   He says, "Now in this I declare unto you that I praise you not, that ye come together
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.760]   not for the better, but for the worse.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.200]   For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be schisms among
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.360]   you, and I partly believe it.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.460]   For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.460]   among you.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.340]   Come together therefore into one place.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:35.540]   This is not to eat the Lord's supper, for in eating every one taketh before other his
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.960]   own supper.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.860]   One is hungry, and another is drunken.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.860]   What?
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.060]   Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.220]   Or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not?
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.220]   What shall I say to you?
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.540]   Why, shall I praise you in this?
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.420]   I praise you not."
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.820]   You see, what was happening was this.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.620]   The rich and the poor.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.620]   The rich are too much.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.980]   They are eating and drinking too much.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.860]   The others are insufficient.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:02.520]   And they were abusing even the Lord's table and the love feasts which they had in connection
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:08.540]   with it, because of this division amongst the rich and the poor, those who had too much
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.260]   and those who did not have enough.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.420]   So the apostle, you see, in coming to his great doctrine—he has already mentioned
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:20.860]   it to them, actually, in chapter 10—he says, "You know, you have not understood this
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.860]   at all."
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.940]   "Listen," says the apostle, in verses 16 and 17 in chapter 10, "the cup of blessing
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.820]   which we bless, is it not the communion?"
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.820]   Communion.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.700]   We are all one together.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:39.660]   It is a communion, some kind of community, a communal spirit.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.020]   Is it not the communion of the blood of Christ, the bread which we break?
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.780]   Is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.340]   For we being many are one bread.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.620]   He said, "You must learn to think of yourselves like a loaf.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.500]   Don't think of yourselves as a collection of people.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.980]   A loaf is not a mere collection of molecules.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.980]   A loaf is one.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.500]   You are one bread, one loaf.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:08.220]   We," he says, "though we are many people, we are one bread, one loaf, and one body,
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:12.780]   for we are all partakers of that one bread."
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:18.900]   And that is the answer, that there are to be no divisions and distinctions recognized
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.900]   in the Christian church.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.100]   It does not matter whether you are wealthy or poor, whether you are clever or whether
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:27.180]   you are lacking in ability, whether you are learned or ignorant, when you come here you
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:31.580]   are one, as the body is one, as the loaf is one.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.740]   No, no, there must be no other divisions introduced here.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:38.260]   James, of course, had to take up the same point, you remember.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.940]   He puts it there in the second chapter of his epistle.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.940]   Let me just read a verse or two to you.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:53.980]   "My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.980]   of persons.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:41:00.340]   For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel, and there
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.300]   come in also a poor man in vile raiment, and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.980]   clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor, Stand
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:15.340]   thou there, or sit here under my footstool.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.500]   Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and have become judges of evil thoughts?
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.500]   And on he goes."
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:25.540]   Now, there is another case of schism.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:30.500]   Division amongst people who confess that they are all sinners and lost and damned, and who
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:36.380]   believe in the same Lord and in his blood, dividing up according to their natural birth,
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.540]   their pedigree, the amount of money or the size of the house in which they were brought
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:46.100]   up, the school they went to, the college they went to, dividing the Christian church over
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.620]   things like that.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.940]   "My brethren, these things ought not to be so."
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.500]   That is schism.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:59.780]   Another cause of division, number five, gifts and understanding.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.300]   I needn't keep you with this.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:07.380]   It is all expanded perfectly in that twelfth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.900]   There they were dividing up the church because of the nature of their gifts, some of the
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.180]   head, some of the feet, some of the eyes, some of the hands, and so on.
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:20.060]   And they were priding themselves or suffering and feeling a sense of grudge because they
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:26.100]   hadn't got the other gift, and the church was divided, torn asunder, guilty of schism,
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.300]   over this question of spiritual gifts.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.060]   You haven't spoken with tongues.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.060]   You haven't done this or that.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060]   I have.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.700]   And the church is divided.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:39.060]   And the apostle says there that if you divide on any one of these accounts, you are guilty
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.060]   of schism.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.260]   All are necessary.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:47.220]   And it is the Spirit who decides how he dispenses his gifts, whether he gives any or none, and
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.820]   what particular gifts he may chance to give.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:55.580]   Of course, you've got the same thing, really, in the eighth chapter of that first epistle
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.340]   to the Corinthians, where they were dividing over their knowledge and understanding about
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.500]   meats offered to idols.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.020]   You've got the same thing in Galatians 6.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:11.820]   Now, says Paul, "Bury one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.620]   Don't despise your weak brother.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.500]   It's in Romans 14.1 and Romans 15.1.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.740]   Same thing again, the weaker brother.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:24.500]   You mustn't divide on these things.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.940]   And it's there again in the epistle to the Colossians.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:32.980]   The Colossian heresy was in a sense this incipient gnosticism, this pride of knowledge, this
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:37.960]   mystical experience, this understanding, this esoteric thing that they claim to have.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.540]   They were dividing the church on that.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.420]   That's equally bad.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:49.420]   I go on to a sixth heading, which is a dividing over rites and ceremonies.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:58.660]   Again, you'll find a kind of reference to that in that same epistle to the Colossians.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:03.620]   And it's there raising its head in other places, in other epistles also.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.700]   Well, these are some of them.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.100]   And I end this morning with this one.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.380]   Bigotry.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.380]   Now what is bigotry?
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:22.580]   Well, it's a very important term, and it's very vital that we should be clear about it.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:29.620]   Bigotry is ultimately a matter of a man's spirit.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:35.100]   Bigotry is ultimately due to a man failing to discipline himself.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:44.460]   To be a bigot means that you are obstinate in what you believe.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.980]   Now the bigot, of course, believes something, yes, but why do you call him a bigot?
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.140]   What is it that constitutes the very essence of bigotry?
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.140]   It's this.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:57.820]   That a man holds on to this particular thing in a blind, unreasoning, and obstinate manner.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.260]   That he won't listen to argument, he won't listen to anything.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:04.580]   I say this, I believe this, and he'll wreck a church, he'll divide anything or everything
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.580]   because of...
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:10.100]   Now, it's a psychological condition.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.620]   The trouble with the poor bigot is that he doesn't realize that.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:17.580]   He thinks he's contending for the faith, but he isn't.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:24.020]   He is a man who lacks balance, he lacks discipline, he doesn't know how to control his own spirit.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.420]   The bigot is a man, of course, whom we should feel very sorry for.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:34.900]   He's a man to be pitied because he is not aware of what is happening to him.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:40.620]   And I believe that ultimately, the ultimate cause of all bigotry is a spirit of fear.
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:46.940]   You see, he's so afraid of being a heretic, he's so afraid of being an apostate, and he's
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.900]   so obsessed by this spirit of fear that he goes right over.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:55.500]   And there he stands, you can't reason with him, he just says it, and his eyes blaze,
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.500]   and he doesn't know what to...
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.460]   He stands with obstinacy, utterly unreasoning.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.340]   He doesn't stop to consider whether the matter is sufficiently important to divide.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.580]   No, no, he just stands and he's obsessed by...
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.680]   It's a form of obsession.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.140]   It is ultimately, therefore, a defect of character.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.700]   It's a psychological condition.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.820]   It is a failure to exercise restraint and self-discipline.
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:28.260]   It is to be governed by a spirit of fear instead of the spirit of power and of love and of
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.260]   a sound mind.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.020]   Well, we've got to leave it at that, I see, for this morning.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.460]   I haven't quite finished this subject.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:42.800]   God willing, I'll go on to consider yet another aspect of this whole danger and problem of
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.460]   schism next Sunday morning.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:52.380]   But we've seen enough, I trust, to make us all see what a terrible, what a horrible,
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.820]   what a foul thing schism is.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.520]   God preserve us from it.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:04.620]   And he can, he will, he tells us that we can be clothed and filled with the power of his
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.620]   might.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:13.220]   And if we partake unto us the whole armor of God, we shall be ready, we shall be prepared,
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:19.260]   we shall see it even beginning to raise its head, and we shall conquer it and defeat it
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:25.100]   before it has conquered and engulfed us.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.980]   Amen.
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.900]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
