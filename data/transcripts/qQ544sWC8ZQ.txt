[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Oh, J Cal's here. Hello, J Cal.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Hey, how are you?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Thanks for showing up.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   I've been here the whole time. I was just, I was just having some of these beautiful
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.440]   salted roasted pistachios. The only problem is when I went to the store, I kid you not,
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.600]   there was a shelf of these. All flavors available except one flavor.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   Salt and vinegar.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.600]   Sea salt and vinegar.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   The entire-
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480]   We moved the market. We moved the market.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.440]   I am not kidding. I go to the fancy, you know, bespoke-
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.440]   The Raley's? You went to the Raley's?
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.800]   You went to the Raley's and Truckee?
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.280]   I went to the Raley's and Truckee, the artisanal, and they have, you know, all these overpriced-
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.200]   First of all, it's called artisanal?
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.440]   That's what I said. The art stuff. The artistic food. The artisanal row where they had this,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.800]   I kid you not, spicy, salty, no salt, every shelf packed. Then there's one shelf I can
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.360]   see straight through to the ice cream.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.440]   But not sea salt and vinegar.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.560]   And I look at the tiny little sign, salt and vinegar, shelled nuts.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.560]   Sea salt and vinegar.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.680]   Sea salt and vinegar. Chamat's shelled nuts. Sold out across the country.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.560]   You know, I cannot recommend these more highly. They're incredible.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.160]   You can't recommend your salty nuts more?
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.840]   They are delicious. My salty nuts are delicious.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:35.080]   Did you see Joe Manchin's high heater op-ed in the Wall Street Journal?
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.560]   Uh-oh.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.520]   Oh my God.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.680]   Yep. Joe Manchin went for it.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.600]   But Joe Manchin's running for president.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.720]   He is. I think. Okay, so let me ask Saks right there.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.600]   Saks, Joe Manchin, Nikki Haley, and who's the guy from Florida?
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.720]   What's your question?
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.200]   By the way, there was a big dissection that was leaked this week. Ron Lauder
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.560]   flipped from Trump to DeSantis. That's a big one because Lauder's good for
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.360]   a lot of money. Five to 10 million at least.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.400]   Joe Manchin, what impact would he have coming into the race? I'm not trolling you.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.520]   Looking for your honest opinion.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.160]   Well, it depends how he comes in. What did he say in the op-ed?
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.600]   He was talking about the insincerity of the Biden administration to control costs and how
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.040]   everybody was incompetent. And it's certainly there's some waste and we can control some
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.360]   spending and everybody needs to grow up and get in a room and just manage the budget for
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.960]   the American people and stop playing politics.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yeah, I think the headline of the article actually, to your point, Jake,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.360]   was much worse than the substance of the article, Saks. But if you see the headline,
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.000]   I don't know, Nick, if you can just throw it up there, it was brutal.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.880]   The headline and the byline of the article, I think, was more damaging than the substance
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.440]   of the article.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.800]   Biden's Inflation Reduction Act betrayal. Instead of implementing the law as intended,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.880]   his administration subverts it for ideological, ideological ends.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.920]   I have to think that Joe was responsible for that, for the titling of that article.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.480]   You don't, you know,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.720]   He would get permission to approve it.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.220]   Right.
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.320]   And by the way, I think if you guys remember, we talked about this when that act was first
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.960]   published. And if you guys remember, I think I pulled up the CBO data, the CBO model,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.680]   and it showed for the first five years, this thing burns a couple hundred billion dollars.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.200]   And then there's some expectation that there'll be some sudden boom in revenue
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.160]   in the out years, and then you make the money back in the out years.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.880]   So it's total like accounting shenanigans for him to have made the claim in the first place
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.040]   that the IRA was actually going to be like a net deficit reduction or debt reduction.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.720]   In fact, it's all just accounting shenanigans. And it's just a massive spend package,
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.360]   particularly in the near term when it matters most.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.200]   I think I told you guys this, but I think this was like,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.000]   when was the last time I was in Washington? Probably, what is it March now? So maybe it
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.320]   was January I was there. And I saw Schumer and Mark Warner, and I spent about two hours with
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   Manchin. He is really impressive. He's cool. He's interesting. He's thoughtful. He's moderate.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.800]   Manchin's like a formidable guy. So this will be really interesting if he steps in there and
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.200]   tries to take on the-
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.080]   Between Nikki Haley and Manchin, where do you write your check?
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.080]   I'd probably write a check to both, to be honest.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.120]   Feels like a good ticket to me. I've always wanted to see the cross-
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.200]   Could you imagine a Democrat and Republican merging somehow and like running together?
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.920]   It would be the greatest.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.520]   Oh my God.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.800]   I've been pitching that for years. I think that's like a clear path.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.840]   David Freeberg may have just come up with one of the most disruptive ideas in American politics
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.880]   that's ever been floated. Oh my God.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.680]   Manchin Haley?
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.160]   Haley Manchin.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.640]   Keep dreaming.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.360]   Manchin Haley, yeah.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.280]   Just my comment on this. So first of all, I remember when, you know, Manchin did a good
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.680]   job stopping Biden's $3.5 trillion build back better. Remember, it was him and Sinema that
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.400]   were the holdouts. But then Manchin compromised and gave Biden a $750 billion version of it.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.480]   And I guess now he's complaining that Biden didn't live up to his end of the bargain in
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.160]   doing the deficit reduction. But quite frankly, many commentators said at the time that the
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.560]   bill's claims to deficit reduction were preposterous and that would never happen.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.680]   So quite frankly, you know, Manchin shouldn't have been euchared or hoodwinked by Biden.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.720]   Everyone was basically saying there'll never be any deficit reduction out of this bill.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.160]   It's just more spending. So I don't really feel bad for Manchin here saying that somehow he was
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.840]   betrayed by Biden. He should have known better. Now, in terms of him running, yeah, I think as
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.720]   a Democrat who's figured out how to get himself elected in West Virginia, which is a plus 20
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.280]   red state, he obviously knows how to appeal to the center. The problem for him is just how do
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.720]   you get the Democratic Party nomination? Because he's far to the right of your average Democratic
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.440]   Party voter. If he wants to run as an independent, that's a different story. And that would really
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.480]   throw a curveball into the race. But I don't see him doing that. I think it's kind of a stretch.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.240]   And this is the problem with a lot of these fantasy candidates is that, you know, centrist or
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.200]   moderate voters might like them, but they can't get the nomination of their party.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.240]   And unless you mean like Trump and Obama, those who are fantasy candidates?
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.440]   I don't think so. I mean...
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.360]   Trump was not a fantasy candidate. He's the ultimate fantasy candidate.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.960]   Well, he was an outsider, but he appealed to the base of the party. He appealed to the
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.040]   base of the party. What I'm saying is in order to get the nomination of a major party, you have
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.440]   to appeal to its base. And I don't think Manchin appeals to the base of the Democratic Party. He's
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.360]   out of step with it. He's out of step with it in ways that I like, don't get me wrong,
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.720]   but I just, I don't see how he's going to get a nomination.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.240]   Chris Christie? What do you think of him? It seems like he's about to come in the race too, David.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.440]   Pointless.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.240]   He's viable?
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.800]   Pointless.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.520]   Pointless.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.800]   He's just clutter.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.360]   Okay.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.560]   Pointless. All right. Listen, everybody, welcome to the all-in podcast. It's like episode 100
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.440]   something with me again today. The Rain Man himself. Yeah. David Sacks is here. Friedberg
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:39.960]   is in his garden at his home in Paris. Spring has sprung. The Queen of Quinoa. And of course,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.560]   the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, the Silver Fox. Look at that little tuft of silver
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.240]   hair. So distinguished.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.320]   I got a haircut from somebody recently who said that people go to her and ask her to put the
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.600]   silver thing in their hair. Really?
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.840]   I don't have to worry about that.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.760]   Friedberg looks like he's in Smurf Village there. What is that background?
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.800]   That is a scene from [censored]
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.680]   Oh, okay.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.000]   I like most of my backgrounds. I think it reflects the mood and the moment of the week.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.040]   You guys just totally, totally denied half the beta mails in the YouTube comments from
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.840]   being able to guess what the background was. Thanks a lot, Sacks.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.120]   You ruined it for them.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.920]   Well, he'll break it up.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.640]   Actually, I did a reverse image search and then I used a chat GPT plug-in to automatically figure
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.720]   out Friedberg's background each week.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.080]   Oh, okay. All right. Well, let's get started. Come on.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.280]   Let's get started. Okay. Listen.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.080]   Look at Sacks. I got to get out of here.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.760]   The alpha is spoken. The alpha is spoken.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   Sacks feels like he's in a good mood. I like this.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.000]   Welcome to the world's greatest podcast.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.600]   OpenAI launched a bunch of chat GPT plugins and I don't know if you saw it, but David Sacks
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.680]   wrote a blog post with chat GPT. It's an amazing back and forth. I read this back and forth.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:05.880]   Explain what you did, Sacks. This was really one of the best conversations I've seen with chat GPT.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.200]   It'll pop it up here on the screen, but explain what you did.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:16.360]   Well, I had an idea for a blog post about the use of a, I guess, tactic you could call give to get.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.640]   I thought it would be an interesting tactic for AI startups to use if they're trying to get a
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.560]   hold of proprietary training data. For example, if you want to create an architect AI, you need
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:34.120]   a lot of plans. Or if you're going to create a doctor AI, you need a lot of lab results or medical
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.080]   reports to train the AI on. Those are hard to get. OpenAI doesn't necessarily have them yet.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.560]   There is an opportunity, I think, for startups to create these AIs in different,
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:50.200]   you'd call them professional verticals. The give to get technique would be you give points to your
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.560]   users for uploading that data and then they can spend those points by using the AI. Anyway,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.560]   the company that came up with this give to get tactic was a company called Jigsaw almost 20
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.400]   years ago. No one remembers this company. I'm kind of dating myself because I remembered it.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.800]   But I just had this idea, gee, I wonder if the Jigsaw approach could be used for AI startups.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:16.200]   I started by going into chat GPT and I said, "Hey, have you heard of Jigsaw?" Then it had.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.880]   Then I said, "Tell me about its give to get approach." Then I said, "Would this approach
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:29.240]   work for AI startups that want proprietary training data sets?" It said, "Yes, this is a good idea."
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.800]   Then I gave the architect example and I said, "Can you give me more examples like this?" It gave me
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.560]   like 20 more examples. Then I asked it just to flesh out various kinds of details. I went down
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.120]   some cul-de-sacs I didn't use. Then at the end, I said, "Can you summarize everything we've just
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.560]   talked about in a blog post?" It gave me the first draft of a blog post. I then did a substantial
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.960]   amount of editing on most of the blog posts, although some of it I just used verbatim.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.120]   Then I had a couple of people in my firm look at it. They made some good suggestions. It's not like
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.920]   the human is completely out of the loop. Then I copied and pasted my edited version back into
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:09.080]   chat. GPT said, "Here's my edit." Then I asked for some suggestions. It made a few small edits.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.560]   I said, "Okay, great. Just incorporate the edits yourself." Gave me that final output.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.640]   Then I posted on Substack, a blog that probably would have taken me a week to research and write.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.080]   If I had done it at all, I was able to do in a day. I can't see myself going back now. I think
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.960]   this is just how I'm going to write all my blog posts is use chat GPT as my researcher,
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.360]   as a writing partner, some cases an editor, but I'm definitely going to run it through.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:45.160]   The thing that I was struck by was just how kind and generous and thoughtful this conversation was.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.520]   I just thought, "I've never seen Sax have a conversation where he was so kind to the
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.880]   other person and thoughtful." Right about now, all your friends and family are like,
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.960]   "How do we get Sax to have this conversation with us?" You were super kind to the AI.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.760]   Because it's not a person, it was a robot.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.260]   Oh, no.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.920]   Well, just in case it takes over the world, J-Cal, you can't be too careful. No, I think,
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.680]   listen, it's important to give the AI-
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.840]   Look at him, he's so kind. He's like, "Oh, perfect, thanks."
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.920]   Perfect, thanks. Exclamation mark.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.840]   I've never once gotten a thanks from Sax.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.160]   Well, show that example, actually.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.200]   Scroll up and show that example. The AI actually gave me some information about Jigsaw's point
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:26.440]   system, again, the rewards that they used. And it was just in text. So I said down below, "Hey,
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.960]   can you spit that out as a table?" And it did instantly, perfectly.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.160]   It's like a day's work, right? You would have to have an analyst or researcher do a day's work.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.880]   It's incredible.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.840]   Then I just screenshot of that and I made it an exhibit in my blog post.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.040]   But you also said thank you.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.400]   And then it was delightful back to you. I mean, this is a-
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.080]   Yes, it was delightful back to me.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:50.120]   This is a literal road to you being a kind human being. All the money that you've spent on therapy
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.080]   and just trying coaching to be nice to people, you're just nice naturally to people.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.160]   No, J. Kell, Sax is in a good mood today. I don't know why you're instigating him.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.640]   He's laughing. Come on, it's fun. You have to think it's funny,
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.440]   Sax saying thank you to the AI. Perfect.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.000]   This is confirmatory of what we know. David wants to live in a set of highly
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.200]   transactional relationships, ideally with a machine,
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.320]   who can then eventually help him make him money.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.000]   Can I ask you a question, though? Sincerely, Sax. What did you enjoy more,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.680]   working with your team of humans on this or working with
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.320]   ChatGPT? Which one was more enjoyable for you, just personally?
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.760]   Well, I think they both were. I would say that the human contributions were essential.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.120]   Okay. But what did you enjoy more?
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:44.120]   It's not about enjoyment. This is just a job to get done, but it definitely sped things up
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.280]   enormously. I personally find the hardest part of writing a blog is when you're staring at that
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.360]   blank sheet of paper and just having to spit out the first thousand words. It's just so time
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.240]   consuming to do that. But again, if you start with the first draft, even if it's not very good,
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.360]   then you can just edit it and it speeds things up a lot.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.960]   Ideation. It's great for ideation.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   But the contributions of people in my firm were important. I actually trusted it. I know that you
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.280]   probably should fact check it in a way because it can hallucinate. But the things that we're
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.160]   saying made so much sense to me that I didn't think it was hallucinating.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:23.640]   Well, this is a great moment to pivot into what OpenAI did with plugins. These came fast and
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:30.840]   furious this week. And a bunch of folks who had started verticalized ChatGPT-based projects,
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:38.040]   MVPs were like, "Oh, maybe my project MVP is now dead," because Instacart, OpenTable, Shopify,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:44.440]   Slack, Zapier, and Zapier, obviously, like if then this, then that is a very wide ranging tool
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:51.080]   that allows you to connect APIs from a multitude of sources. And what this all lets you do at the
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:58.600]   end of the day is have ChatGPT ping one of these sources, just like an app might do or some custom
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:06.440]   software might do, ping the API and return data. So, hey, what tables are open on OpenTable?
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:14.280]   Maybe Shopify, find me things to buy in this category, etc. And so people have started building
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:22.600]   little scripts. We used to call these when magic leap was out, internet agents, and the concept of
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.200]   a software agent that's existed for a long time, actually, in computer science, I'm sure Freebird
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.000]   will give us some examples of that. But also ChatGPT can now use a browser. So that means you
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.720]   can get around the dated nature of the content in the corpus. Somebody did things like, "Hey,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.600]   build me a meal plan, book me a reservation for Friday night in OpenTable, source other ingredients
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:50.360]   and buy it for Saturday night on Instacart and then use something like Wolfram Alpha to, you
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:56.760]   know, calculate the calories, etc." So when you saw this drop, Sax, what did you think in terms of
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:05.320]   the opportunity for startups and to build these intelligent agents, things that will do if that,
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.400]   if this, then that, or just background tasks over time, and you could actually leave them running?
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.160]   Yeah, I mean, I think this is the most important developer platform
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:22.360]   since the iPhone and the launch of iOS in the App Store, and I would argue maybe ever in our
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.960]   industry, certainly since the beginning of the internet. I think there was a question when
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.720]   ChatGPT launched on November 30th, and people started playing with in December, what exactly
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:38.120]   OpenAI's product strategy was going to be? Was this just like a proof of concept or a demo?
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:44.280]   And they even kind of called it like a demo. And initially, it looked like what their business
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:51.080]   model was going to be was providing an intelligence API that other websites, other applications could
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.200]   incorporate. And we saw some really cool demos like that Notion demo of other applications
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:02.280]   incorporating AI capabilities. And so initially, it looked like what OpenAI was going to be was
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.720]   more like Stripe, where in the same way that Stripe made payments functionality available
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.520]   very easily through a developer platform, they were going to make AI capabilities available
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.320]   through their developer platform. And then I think a funny thing happened on the way to this
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.560]   announcement, which is they became the fastest growing application of all time, talking about
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.760]   ChatGPT, over 100 million users in two months. Nobody else has ever done that before. I think
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:33.720]   it took the iPhone, you know, two years plus, Gmail, Google, those products all took, I think,
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.480]   well over a year. So this became the fastest growing site of all time. And I think with
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.360]   plugins, what they're indicating is that they will become a destination site. This is not just a
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.640]   developer platform, this is a destination site. And through plugins, they are now incorporating
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:56.120]   the ability to basically, you know, anything you could do through an application, you will now be
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.400]   able to do through a plugin, you'll just tell ChatGPT what you want done. If you say, hey,
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.960]   book me a plane ticket on this date, it will go into Kayaks plugin and do that. You say,
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.640]   book me a plane ticket and then an Airbnb.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:14.280]   So the promise of Siri and Alexa realized because those were very rigid, they had no intelligence,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:20.680]   right, Friedberg? If you wanted Siri to do something specific, like use Waze, or to go
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:26.280]   get you an open table, it needed to be pretty specific. And it didn't have any kind of natural
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.160]   language model behind it. So this is taking existing APIs and putting a natural language
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.760]   layer in front of it, which makes it, you know, perform a little more naturally. Is that what
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.640]   we're seeing here, Friedberg?
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:45.400]   I think it provides access to a corpus of data and a suite of services that are not well
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:52.760]   integrated into a search or chat interface anywhere today. So, you know, knowing what
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.480]   restaurants have what seats available is in a closed service, it's in a data warehouse,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.640]   operated by OpenTable. And now what OpenTable can do is provide an API into that data
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.640]   via an interface and they can allow chat GPT to make a request to figure that data out
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:16.840]   to give a response to a user where they can ultimately benefit from transacting and allowing
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:24.840]   a service. This closes the loop between search and commerce in a way that Google cannot and
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.240]   does not do today. And I think that's what makes it very powerful. We've seen this
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.760]   attempted in a number of important ways in the last couple of years with Alexa
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.400]   and Apple Home and Google Home kind of integration via the chat services that they offer,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.200]   you know, where you speak to the device. But the deep integration that's possible now,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.080]   and the natural language way that you can go from the request all the way through to the
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.760]   transaction is what makes this so extremely powerful. And I think, you know, the points
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.440]   I made a few weeks ago, when we first talked about, you know, search, having so many searches
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:07.160]   that are done, where the human computer interface presents a table or presents a chart, or presents
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.600]   a shopping list in a matrix. That's what makes search such a defensible product, I think,
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.240]   could theoretically be completely obviated or destroyed with an interface like this,
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:23.560]   where you can write the ability for chat GPT or whatever the core centralized services to
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:29.000]   actually present results in a table in a matrix in an interface in a shopping list, and actually
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.200]   close the transaction loop. It's really disruptive to things like commerce providers,
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.040]   it's really disruptive. You know, some of these commerce platforms, it's really disruptive
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.840]   to a lot of different industries, but also introduces a lot of real opportunity to build
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.480]   on top of that capability and that functionality to rewrite and ultimately make things easier and
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.920]   better for consumers on the internet. What do you think Chamath you're looking at this,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.440]   and it seems to be moving at a very fast pace. Over 100 million users, they put a business model
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.720]   on it already 20 bucks a month, they have a secondary business model of, hey, use the API
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.120]   and we'll charge you for usage. And then you layer on what Zapier and if this than that had
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.720]   already sort of established in the world, which is API's, but nobody ever really wanted to write
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.840]   scripts. So that seemed to be the blocker, you go into Zapier, if this and that, it's where 5%
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.600]   of the audience people want to customize stuff, people who want to tinker. But this seems to now
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.960]   with the chat GPT chat interface, open it up to a lot of people. So is this super significant? Or
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.680]   is this a commodity product that, you know, 10 people will have for sitting here next year on
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.760]   all in Episode 220? I think you are asking the exact right question. And you use the great term,
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:43.640]   like in poker, if there are three hearts on the board, and you have the ace of hearts,
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:50.360]   you have what's called the nut blocker, right? Which means that nobody else, even if anybody
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:55.480]   else has a flush, they never have the best flush. And if flush is the best hand, there's a lot of
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.320]   ways that you can manipulate the pot and eventually win the pot because you have that ace of hearts
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:06.360]   and nobody else has it. The concept of blocker, I think is very important to understand here,
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.040]   which is what are the real blockers for this capability to not be broadly available.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.360]   So I think you have to segregate, you have the end user destination,
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:23.160]   you have the language model, and then you have the third party services. And so if you ask the
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.720]   question, what is the incentive of the third party service? Well, the shareholders of
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:36.440]   a travel site, right? They're not interested in doing an exclusive deal with any distribution
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:42.040]   endpoint, they want their services integrated as broadly as possible. Right? So I think the
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:48.520]   the answer for the service providers is just like they build an app for iOS and for Google. And,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.600]   you know, if they could have justified it, they would have built an app for a gaming console,
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.800]   they can, they should, they would, they do. Right? So that's going to get commoditized
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.120]   and broadly available. I think on the LLM side, I think we've talked about this.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.440]   Everybody's converging on each other. In fact, there was an interesting
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.760]   article that was released that said that there was a handful of Google engineers that quit,
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.960]   because apparently Bard was actually learning on top of
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.720]   chat GPT, which they felt was either legal or unethical or something, right? So,
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.120]   so the point is, I think we've talked about this for a while, but all of these models will
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.720]   converge in the absence of highly unique data, right? What I've been calling these white truffles.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.920]   So if you can hoard white truffles, your model will be better. Otherwise, your model will be
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.440]   the same as everybody else's model. And then you have the distribution endpoints of which there
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.880]   are many whose economic incentives are very high, right? So Facebook doesn't want to just sit around
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.760]   and have all this traffic go to chat GPT, they want to be able to enable Instagram users and
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.640]   WhatsApp users and Facebook users to interact through messenger or what have you. Obviously,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:08.040]   Google has a, you know, many hundreds of billions of reasons to defend their territory. So I think
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.720]   all of this to me just means that these are really important use cases. As an investor,
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:20.200]   I think it's important to just stay a little patient. Because it's not clear to me that
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.920]   there are any natural blockers. But I do think that David's right that it's demonstrating a
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:32.200]   use case that's important. But it's still so early, we are six weeks in. Yeah, I tell you,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.600]   I think there's a couple of great blockers here, or there's going to be an M&A bonanza for Silicon
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:45.000]   Valley. If you look at certain data sets, Reddit, stack overflow for programming, and Cora, these
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.880]   things are going to be worth a fortune and to be able to buy those or get exclusive licenses to
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.840]   those if you're maybe Google barred, or if you're a chat GPT, that could be a major difference maker
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.040]   Twitter's data set, obviously. And then you look at certain tools like Zapier. And if this and that
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:07.400]   they've spent a decade building the sort of meta API, that would be an incredible blocker. I think
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.800]   this is going to be like a balkanization of so many oil sources. Zapier already did it for free,
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.720]   they did a plugin for free. Yeah, exactly. I was just going to say, I don't think these are not
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.880]   blockers. I don't think this is the ace of hearts on the flush board. I don't think so. I think that
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:26.520]   these things are really interesting assets. They are definitely truffly in nature. But they may not
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.240]   be the you know, 10 pound white truffle from Alba that we're looking for. Yeah, no, but on the M&A
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.920]   side, don't you think this would be like incredible? No, but the only reason I say that again,
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.320]   is it is just so early, like I in the text, I mentioned this to you guys, I remember,
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.920]   and sacks and I were in the middle of this. We were both right at the beginning of social
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.880]   networking, sack started genie, I was in the middle of aim. And all of a sudden, we saw
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:56.920]   read start social net. Then we saw Friendster get started. Then we saw myspace get started. And you
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.200]   have to remember, when you look back now 20 years later, the winner was the seventh company, which
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.480]   was Facebook, not the first, not the second, it was the seventh, which started two and a half years
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.440]   properly after the entire web point to a phenomenon started. Yeah, same with search,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.800]   by the way, where Google was probably 20. Exactly. To the scene. Yeah, excite like us.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.400]   If you want to be a real student of business history, I'll just say something that's more
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   meta, which is, if there's something that I've learned on the heels of this SVB fiasco,
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:34.120]   is that there is an enormous amount of negative perception of Silicon Valley, and frankly,
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:40.280]   a lot of disdain for VCs and prognosticating technologists, right. And I think that
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.760]   So you mean this podcast?
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.560]   I think we have to be very careful. Yeah. And I do think that we are an example of that,
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.760]   because we are the bright, shiny object of the people that were successful. And the broad makeup
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.280]   of America thinks that we're not nearly as smart as we all think we are. And after all of this money
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.880]   that's been burned in crypto land, and NF T's and all of this web three nonsense, to yet again,
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:10.680]   whip up the next hype cycle, I think doesn't serve us well. So I do think there's something
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:18.600]   very important here. But I think if we want to maintain reputational capital through this cycle,
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.800]   because government will get involved much faster in this cycle, I think it's important to just
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.440]   be methodical and thoughtful, iterate experiment, but it's too early to call it,
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.560]   I guess is what I would say.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.240]   Yeah, it's definitely too early to call it. But,
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.040]   Saks, you're saying explicitly, you think this is bigger than the internet itself,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.760]   bigger than mobile as a platform shift.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.200]   It's definitely top three. And I think it might be the biggest ever. I think, look,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.720]   I think things could certainly play out the way that Jamath is saying. However,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   I actually think that open AI has demonstrated now with these platform features, that it has a lead,
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.520]   a substantial lead. And I actually think that lead is likely to grow in the next year. And let me
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.640]   tell you why I think it's got a couple of assets here that are hard to replicate. So number one,
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.200]   user attention, I think they've now got, I would guess hundreds of millions of users. And this
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.160]   thing is caught on like wildfire, must have been beyond their wildest dream. I think it even
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.120]   surprised them how much this has taken off. It's really captured the public's imagination and
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:24.360]   people are discovering new use cases for it every day. If you are sort of the number two or number
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:30.040]   three or the seventh large language model to basically get deployed behind a chatbot, I just
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.080]   don't think you're going to get that kind of distribution because the novelty factor will
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:39.480]   have worn off and people will have already kind of learned to use chat GPT. So number one is the
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.560]   hundreds of millions of eyeballs. Number two is with this developer platform, I think we should
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:49.160]   describe a couple of other features of it. One of the problems with chat GPT, if you've used it,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:55.080]   is that the training data ends in 2021. And so you very rapidly for many questions, get to a
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.560]   stopping point where it says, like, I don't know the answer to that because I don't have any
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.920]   information about the last two years. Well, one of the plugins that OpenAI has introduced itself
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:11.640]   is called the browsing plugin. And it allows chat GPT to go search the internet and not just run
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:18.360]   internet searches, but to run an internet search as if it were a human. So you ask chat GPT a
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:24.200]   question and it goes to find, it runs a search and then it scours through the list of 20 links
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.960]   and it doesn't stop until it finds a good answer. And then it comes back to you with just the
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.560]   answer. So it actually saves you the time of clicking through all those loops and it'll give
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.120]   you the browsing history to show you what it did. That's mind blowing. They also have a thing called
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:43.000]   a retrieval API, which allows developers to share proprietary knowledge bases with chat GPT. So if
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.760]   you have a company knowledge base or some other kind of content, you can share with chat GPT so
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.160]   that chat GPT can be aware of that. And there are some privacy concerns, but the company has said
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.400]   they're going to sandbox that data and protect it. As an example, I'm planning on writing a book on
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.280]   SAS using chat GPT, and I'm going to put together all the previous articles and talks I've done as
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:09.960]   a database so I can then work with that in chat GPT. So you're going to have more and more developers
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:18.440]   sharing information with chat GPT. You're going to have chat GPT able to update its training based
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.680]   on sort of the last two years, being able to search the internet. And I think that as those
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.840]   hundreds of millions of users use the product, and as developers keep sharing more and more of
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.320]   these data sets, the AI is going to get smarter and smarter. And then what's going to happen is
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.600]   both consumers and developers are going to want to use or build on the smartest API.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.440]   Yeah, see, this is where it feeds on itself. I mean, yeah, I think there might be a
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.640]   I agree with much of what you're saying. But I do think somebody like Facebook, when they release
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.920]   their language model, which they're about to, is not going to allow chat GPT to have any access to
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.640]   the Facebook corpus of data. And then LinkedIn will do the same, they'll block any access to
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.120]   chat GPT to their data. And so then you might say, you know what, I'm doing something related
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.880]   to business and business contacts, I need to use the LinkedIn one. And they're just going to block
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.400]   other people's usage of and tell you, hey, you have to come to our interface and have a pro
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:12.760]   account on LinkedIn. And this all becomes little islands of data. And so I'm not sure that you may
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.600]   be right to call us too early to have a definitive opinion. But I would say I have to believe plugins
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.680]   are going to be promiscuous. Yes, exactly. plugins are the refutation of your idea does
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.560]   not have an API, Twitter turned off their API, people who are smart, data sets, Cora doesn't
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.840]   let people use its data. So I just picked three. Those are three incredible data sets that don't
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:35.560]   allow people and Craigslist doesn't. So people who are smart, do not allow API's into their data,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:41.560]   they keep it for themselves. I think there were a lot of people when the app store rolled out
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.360]   that swore up and down, they'd never build a mobile app, because they didn't want to give
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.080]   Apple that kind of power that the internet was open, whereas the app store is closed and curated
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.640]   by Apple. And sure enough, they all at the end of the day had to roll out apps, even though in
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.200]   the case of Facebook, it definitely has made them vulnerable, because they're downstream of Apple.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.400]   I mean, Apple now has enormous influence over Facebook's advertising revenue, because
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.640]   users have to go through Apple, they never had to do that before the internet. Nonetheless,
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.880]   Facebook felt compelled to release a mobile app, because they knew was existential for them,
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   if they did it. And I believe that was happening. I don't think it's right analogy, the right
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:21.400]   analogy would be Google search, does Facebook does Craigslist allow their data to be indexed
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.720]   inside of Google search answers? No, right? They block that for a reason they and they will write
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.320]   a cease and desist letter. Fine. So so you know what, those guys will stay out of it. But look
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:35.160]   how much content Google search already has. And I think that chat GPT will start by eating a
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.360]   substantial portion of search, because again, you don't have to go through the 20 links,
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.800]   it just gives you the answer. It's going to eat a substantial portion of browser usage and app
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.880]   usage, because you're just going to tell chat GPT what you want to do. It will go book your plane
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.960]   ticket, it will go book your hotel room. Yeah, see, this is a play in this hold on the apps that
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.840]   want to play in this will benefit. So there'll be a powerful incentive for applications to get an
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   advantage by participating. Let me finish my point. Yeah. And then eventually, they will be forced to
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.360]   do it not because they get an advantage, but because they're so competitively disadvantaged,
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.760]   if they don't participate in that ecosystem, I agree that they'll participate in it. But here's
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.200]   the thing, what's going to happen is Google is going to turn on bard and I've been playing with
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:24.520]   bard, it is 80% of chat GPT already. And then when they make bard a default, you know, little snippet
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.240]   on your Google search return page, or bard is built into YouTube, or Chrome, or Android,
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.640]   all the Play Store, they're going to roll right over chat GPT because they have billions of users
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:39.480]   already. So this advantage that you see today, I see that getting rolled real quick, because you'll
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.400]   be on YouTube. And on the top right hand side will be barred. And when you do a search, it's going to
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.800]   say, here are other sentences you could do, oh, you want to search Mr. Beast, when he's helped
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.560]   people or Mr. Beast when he's given away more money, or people have copied and been inspired
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.560]   by Mr. Beast, all that's going to occur inside of YouTube, and chat GPT is not going to have access
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.760]   to the YouTube corpus of data. And then when you do a search, it's going to be the same thing,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.960]   it's going to be on the right hand side. And it's going to be playing just like it is in Bing,
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.600]   if you turn on your Android phone, they're going to make Google Assistant go right into bard.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.320]   And Google Assistant is already used by hundreds of millions of people. So I think that Google
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:17.160]   will roll. I think they're going to roll chat GPT. I don't know who's going to win. But I'm looking
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:23.320]   at this saxapoo more reductively as a capitalist, which is what are people's incentives, because
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:32.840]   that's what they'll do. Google's incentive is to usurp chat GPT usage by inserting something
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:39.160]   inside of their existing distribution channels to suppress the ability for you to want to go
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:45.720]   to the app known as bundling. I think Facebook has that same incentive. Oddly, even though
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.960]   Microsoft is such a deep partner, I think certain assets of Microsoft have that incentive, you're
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:55.080]   talking collectively about five or $6 trillion of market cap, then when you add in Alexa, and
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:02.920]   Amazon and Siri and Apple, what is their incentive, I don't think their incentive is to let this
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:08.200]   happen. And I think if you look at the slack, Microsoft Teams example of even a better engineer
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.480]   product was excellent and widely deployed, even at hundreds of millions of users doesn't much
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:22.040]   matter when it's more cleverly distributed and priced. And so those things again, you may still
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:28.840]   be right, all I'm saying is, it's just so early to know. And as slow and lumbering as some of
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:35.000]   these big companies are, they are not so stupid as to kill their own golden goose and or defend it
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.680]   when threatened. So I think you just have to let let it see what happens. I want to finish the
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.720]   point on Google. And then we can move on to the bundling thing. Let me just make the counter
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.600]   argument, which is that I think Google is caught completely flat footed here, even though they
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.560]   shouldn't have been because they published the original paper on transformers in 2017. They
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:57.000]   should have seen where all this was going, but they didn't open AI, use that paper and commercialized
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.680]   it. And the proof of that is there was just a lawsuit a couple of days ago, or at least a claim
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:09.720]   by a former employee of Google who quit, because he said that they were using chat GPT to train
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:17.160]   their AI. So their AI is so far behind. They were violating the terms of use, hold on,
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:23.960]   they were violating the terms of use of open AI to train their own AI on chat GPT. That's not a
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:29.640]   good sign. That's not a good sign. I also think hold on, hold on, I'm just making the counter
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:34.280]   argument here. I mean, don't dismiss it out of hand, give me a chance to explain it. Moreover,
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:41.640]   chat GPT for which was just released a few weeks ago, we know that open AI had that they were using
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.240]   it internally for seven months. So the state of the art is not what we're using. It's what
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:53.640]   open AI has internally, they're obviously working now on chat GPT five. And so if you're saying
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:01.800]   that Bard is 80% of chat GPT four, well, I got news for you, it's probably 50% or 20% of chat
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:08.680]   GPT five. And who knows what the product roadmap is inside of open AI, I am sure that they've got
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:14.280]   200 ideas for things they could do to make it better and low hanging fruit. But look, regardless,
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.160]   I think the pace of innovation here in development is going to speed up massively. I mean, there is
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.040]   going to be a flurry of activity. I agree, it's hard to know exactly how it's going to play out.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.200]   But I think this idea that oh, it's a foregone conclusion, these big companies are just going
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.520]   to catch up with open AI, I think that there's a strong counter argument. That's not the case.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.360]   I'm making a very specific argument. It's not a foregone conclusion where all the value will
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:42.200]   get captured. Just like in any of these major tidal waves. If you make the bets too early,
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:48.520]   you typically don't make all the money. And it tends to be the case. And it has been in the past,
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.880]   at least with these transformative moves. It's sort of in the early third of the cycle,
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:59.080]   is where the real opportunities to make the tons of money emerge. And there's a lot of folks that
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.160]   show you a path and then just don't necessarily capture the value. I'm not saying that that's
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:09.000]   going to be the case here. All I'm saying is, if history is a guide, all of these other big waves
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.760]   have shown that fact pattern. And so I'm very excited and I'm paying attention. But I'm just
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.920]   being circumspect with this idea that you know, having been in the middle of these couple of
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.760]   waves before it, I made all the money by waiting a couple years. I don't know if that's going to
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.720]   be true this time around. But right, that's sort of my posture right now.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.680]   So you look, you obviously have a point because we're only four months in. So how can we know
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.000]   where this is going to be in five years. So you could be right to your point, Saks. I think it's
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.520]   clear. And this is, you know, big ups to the open AI team, that they will be one of the top two or
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.720]   three players. Absolutely. We all agree on that, which is extraordinary in itself. And the top four
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   players freeberg are obviously going to be Microsoft OpenAI, we'll call that like, whatever
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:56.120]   that little, you know, pairing, and then Google, Facebook. And then we haven't talked about Apple,
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.760]   but obviously, Apple is not going to take this sitting down. And hopefully, they'll get in gear
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.000]   and have Siri, you know, make it to the next level, or they'll just put her out to pasture.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.080]   If you were to look at those four, and we're sitting here a year from now, who has the best
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.880]   product offering? Who has the biggest user base? Just take a minute to think about that. Because
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:22.360]   you were at Google. And we all know, the word on the street is, it's the return of the kings.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:27.480]   Larry and Sergey are super engaged by all reports, every back channel, everybody I talked to was
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.680]   saying that their every day, they're obsessed with Google's legacy now and making this happen.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:38.600]   So what can you tell us in terms of who you think a year or two from now, we'll have the biggest
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:44.440]   user base and be the most innovative amongst that quartet, or maybe you think there's other players
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:53.320]   who will emerge? The advantage that OpenAI has, which is the advantage that any call it emerging,
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:39:01.080]   you know, advantage competitor has, outside is, yeah, outsider is that the incumbents are
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:07.560]   handicapped by their current scale. Much of the consideration set that Google has had in deciding
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.440]   what features and tools to launch with respect to AI over the last couple of years, has been driven
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:18.280]   fundamentally by a concern about public policy and public reaction. And I know this from speaking to
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:26.120]   folks there that are close enough to kind of indicate like, Google has been so targeted has
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.400]   been such the point of attack by governments around the world with respect to their scale and
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:39.240]   monopoly and monopolistic kind of behavior. Some people have framed it privacy concerns, you know,
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:45.160]   etc, etc. The fines in the EU are extraordinary, that so much of what goes on at Google today,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.960]   is can I get approval to do this? And so many people have felt so frustrated that they can't
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.680]   actually unleash the toolkit that Google has built. And so they've been harnessed and focused
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.440]   on these internal capabilities. I think I mentioned this in the past, but things like,
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:04.040]   what's the right video to show on YouTube to keep people engaged? What's the right ad to show to
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.080]   increase click through rates, etc, etc. versus building great consumer products for fear of the
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.560]   backlash that would arise, and governments coming down on them and ultimately, and ultimately
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:19.080]   attacking the revenue and the core revenue stream. And this is no different than any other kind of
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.400]   innovative dilemma. You know, any other business of scale in any other industry historically
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.360]   ultimately gets disrupted, because their job at that point is to protect their cash flow and their
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:34.040]   revenue stream and their balance and their assets, not to disrupt themselves, especially as a public
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.200]   company, especially under the scrutiny and the watchful eye of governments and regulators.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:44.840]   So I think Google has, in aggregate, probably good competitive talent, if not better talent
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:50.520]   than open AI and others. Google has arguably the best corpus of data upon which to train
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:55.400]   the best capabilities, the best toolkit, the best hardware issues, the lowest cost
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.360]   for running these sorts of models, the lowest cost for serving them, etc, etc. So frankly,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.800]   they're way behind the battle is theirs to lose, if they are willing to disrupt themselves. And
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:10.360]   this is the moment that Larry and Sergey should wield those founders shares that they have.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.040]   And they should wield the comments that they wrote in that founders letter, that they will always
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.200]   make the right decision for the long term for this company, even if it means taking a cost in
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.320]   the short term and disrupting themselves. This is the moment to prove that those founders shares
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:29.080]   were worth, you know, the negotiation to get there. And, and I think that it is going to require
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.040]   a real degree of scrutiny, a real degree of regulatory uncertainty, a real degree of
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.520]   challenge by governments, and public policy people, and perhaps even a revenue hit in the
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:43.160]   near term to realize the opportunity, but I do think that they're better equipped to win if they
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.520]   chose to. Well said,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.760]   well, really well said. I think the founders share insight is particularly interesting,
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.600]   Saks. The fact that by the way, sorry for those who did nothing with them.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.360]   Gotcha. Yeah, no, no, I was just gonna say the exact same thing. It's like, if they don't use
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:03.160]   it now, what would it take? And when? Yeah, this is good. Yet another, yet another case of the
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:07.960]   emperor has no clothes, just a power grab by Silicon Valley execs, which was meaningless,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.840]   because if in this moment, you don't wield that power, and break that company into bits as you
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:18.360]   need to, what was the point of having it? They need to come in and say, we're going to give
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.920]   barred results to 10% of users and ask them to get feedback on it. Because who has worse
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:29.240]   queries than just one point I want to make there for revert, who has more reinforcement learning
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:35.000]   than Google, that search box is everywhere. And people write after question and Gmail,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.600]   and Google Docs, etc, etc. I mean, they have so many people asking questions. And YouTube might
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:46.200]   be the the transcripts of YouTube, every video and the image of every video bananas and the comments
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.440]   under it, you know, the comments under the video, you have the transcript of what happened in this
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.160]   video. And then what was the question and answer underneath it? Let me make the counterpoint,
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.880]   please, to my own point, like, look at how Gerstner came after Zuck. So Zuck had his point
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:05.000]   of view, his strongly held belief that AR VR was the future of the platform. That's what he wanted
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.520]   to bet into. That's what he wanted to lean into. It's what he wanted to build the company against.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:13.560]   He did it. And then the financial analysts and the investors came at him and said,
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.880]   this is a waste of money, focus on making money, you have a responsibility to shareholders,
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   F those founders shares, you don't deserve that 10x voting right, or whatever the framing might
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.880]   have been to get him to say, you know what I acquiesce, I'm giving it up. And I think that
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.320]   we should also think about what's going to happen on the other side, Google is a trillion plus dollar
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.680]   market cap company. Their shares are owned by every public endowment, public pension fund,
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.840]   institutional investor owns Google in their portfolio. So the backlash against Google
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.800]   making a hard bet like this, and potentially destroying billions of dollars of cash flow
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.680]   in the process every year will not be easy to do that the same sorts of letters that Gerstner at
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.000]   all and obviously, we love Gerstner. And, you know, we can all defend him all day long. At
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.040]   Zuck is what might may end up happening with with alphabet if they did choose to go this path.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.960]   Saks, what do you think here about the founder share specifically Google's chances
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.560]   of disrupting themselves and, you know, just putting this into every product
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.600]   and shoving it down users throats and catching up?
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:16.120]   Well, I mean, with all due respect, Larry and Sergey, I mean, they've been on the beach a long
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:22.440]   time. This reminds me of Apollo Creed coming out of retirement in rocket four.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.920]   A lot of shape, a lot of shape.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.320]   A lot of a lot of fanfare.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.160]   They could be a little out of shape.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.480]   Sam Altman may not look like Ivan Drago, but but this this is one shrewd character.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.400]   This is one shrewd character. I mean,
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.200]   Altman is fit.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:38.840]   He's fit.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.440]   He's been in the arena.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.600]   Yeah, he's, you know, he's a multi time founder who sat at the top of YC and got to see everything
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:51.240]   that worked. Yep. And got to see all the research and he's been plugging away at this for what,
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:57.320]   like, years. So there's a there's a big I just think there's a big gap to catch up on. Now,
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.880]   Google has all the resources in the world. And they've got a lot of proprietary assets,
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.320]   too. And they've got all the incentive in the world. So do I think that Google will be
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.760]   one of the top four players in AI? Absolutely. But this idea that is going to come in steamroll
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.560]   open AI, I have a prediction. I got a prediction. But then next year, Larry and Sergey take the
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:20.520]   title of co CEOs. And then they do a demo day where the two of them get on stage.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:26.440]   They actually do the demos of these products. If that happens, that fictional quantification,
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.520]   that's it. That's listen, and base us to the run for president. Those are my two predictions.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.760]   I'm taking love riddance. Can you imagine if Larry freeberg? Where are the chances of Larry
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.000]   and Sergey taking co CEO slots? That's prediction one and then prediction two,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.200]   where are the chances of them running the next Google IO, where they get on stage and they walk
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.840]   people through all the products that they shepherded and that they have a vested interest in that
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:54.760]   there they want to demo. There is an institutional problem at Google at the top level, which does
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:46:02.040]   need to be solved, which is this position of constantly being in defense against the scrutiny,
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:07.240]   again, of regulators and public policy folks and, you know, all these different groups that are
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:13.800]   against Google. And so as a result, the kind of cultural seasoning, particularly the executive
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:19.720]   and the board level has been one of like, you know, protect the nest, don't overreach, don't
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:25.800]   overstep. And it's a real, you know, I think one for the for the business school books or whatever,
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.200]   ultimately is what they end up doing about it. Because now is, you know, the time when
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.040]   that defensive posture is really kind of putting the entire business at risk.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.920]   The same thing happened to Microsoft. Remember in the late 90s? That's right,
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.320]   when they got crushed by that antitrust lawsuit, that can be very defensive.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.000]   Well, that can know but that consent decree,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.200]   they put up they had a wartime CEO come in, Balmer came in. And, you know, followed by kind
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:53.720]   of an innovative guy who could kind of continue to build. And I think that there may be a moment
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.760]   here. I look, I love Sundar. He's a great guy, great CEO, because sooner or not, I don't forget,
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.800]   if I ever told you this, he and I started at Google on the same day. We're both in the same
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:07.160]   nuclear class, we were the freaking hat on the TGIF day and on stage. He was a product manager,
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:13.320]   and now he runs the company. But I think the question is like, whether it's the CEO or the
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:18.440]   broader whole kind of executive org or the board, a degree of disruption necessary to shift that
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.760]   cultural seasoning is so necessary right now, for them to have a shot at this. And similar to what
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.400]   you just said, sacks, like you're gonna need a bomber type moment to kind of, you know,
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.480]   reinvigorate that business. And by the way, I'll tell you such a moment, I think that
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:37.240]   it's an important port point when bomber took over during that period after gates,
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.680]   when they were on their heels, he basically just focused on revenue and paying dividends
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:47.560]   and stock buybacks, and the stock went sideways. And he missed mobile. And now,
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.840]   yeah, it's a good point.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:53.480]   Jay K. You're forgetting one big thing, which is that that was also because he had to operate
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.880]   under a consent decree to the DOJ. Exactly. So the product managers of Microsoft were replaced
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.560]   with lawyers from the Department of Justice, and you had to get their sign off before you
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.920]   could ship anything. So we have to remember that those things probably slowed Microsoft down as
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:14.120]   well. And the great thing that Satya had was a blank slate and the removal of that consent decree.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:19.720]   So he was able to do everything that just made a lot of sense. And he's executed flawlessly.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:28.520]   I think the problem at Google is not Sundar or Larry or Sergey. I think it's more in the deep
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.080]   bowels of middle management of that company, which is that there's just far too many people
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:39.960]   that probably have an opinion. And their opinion is not shrouded in survival. Their opinion is
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:46.040]   shrouded in elite language around what is the moral and ethical implications of this and where
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:53.000]   has this been properly tested on the diaspora of 19 different ethnic tribes of the Amazon.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.920]   That's the kind of decision making that is a nice to have when you are the second or third
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:05.080]   most valuable technology company in the world. But you have to be able to pause that kind of
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:11.000]   thinking and instead get into wartime survival mode. And it's very hard. So it doesn't almost
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.720]   matter. At this point, what Sundar wants, the real question is, what is the capability of middle
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.080]   management to either do it or get out of the way. And I think that in all of these big companies
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:28.120]   that struggle, what you really see is an inability for middle management to get out of the way or
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:34.840]   frankly, just you need somebody to then fire them. And if you look at folks who get their groove back,
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:40.360]   let's see what Facebook does. What are they targeting? They're targeting middle management.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:46.840]   If you look at what Elon does in the companies that he owns, there is virtually no middle management.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:53.640]   It's like get out of the way, build product, build product and ship it. Yeah. And what is
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:58.200]   the core truth? And so if failure is there in front of you, and if David is right, that you
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.720]   have 200 million users come out of nowhere, who are voting every day with their time and attention
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:09.080]   to use an app, and that doesn't create a five alarm fire where you get middle management out
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:15.000]   of the way and you are the senior most people talking to the people doing the work and shipping
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.760]   things every day you're you are toast. You are toast. A lot of people are starting to think
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:27.480]   we're moving a little bit too fast. When it comes to open AI is incredible performance, which I GPT
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:33.560]   for the plugins and all this and so the future of life Institute, which was formed in 2015. It's a
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:41.240]   nonprofit that's focused on de risking major technology like AI. They did a petition titled
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:47.000]   pause giant AI experiments and open letter, a bunch of computer scientists sign this letter.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.840]   And the letter quote says we must ask ourselves should we let machines flood our information
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:59.880]   channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs including the
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:04.440]   fulfilling ones? Should we develop non human minds that might eventually outnumber outsmart
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.640]   obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization, a number of notable
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:15.320]   tech leaders like Elon, Steve Wozniak, and a handful of deep mind researchers have signed it.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.840]   What do you guys think of the latter? Are we going to slow down or not? And then we can ask the
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.680]   question generally, how close are we getting to AGI, which is what everybody's scared of,
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:27.560]   is that these agents start working with each other in the background to do things that are
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.840]   against human interest. I know it sounds like science fiction. But there is a theory that when
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:38.920]   these AI is start operating on their own, like we explained in the previous sort of segment here with
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:45.560]   plugins, and they make agents that are operating based on feedback from each other, could they get
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.880]   out of control and be mischievous and then work against human interest? Or what do you think sex?
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.560]   I think there's a difference between what could happen in the short term and then what could
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:58.120]   happen in the long term. I think in the short term, everything we're seeing right now is
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:02.600]   very positive. And let me just give you an example. There was a really interesting
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:09.160]   tweet storm about a guy who wrote about how Chad GPT saved his dog. And do you guys see this?
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:16.680]   This is one of the really mind blowing ones to me, use cases. So his dog was sick, took him to a vet,
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.600]   vet prescribed some medication, three days later, dog still sick, in fact, even worse.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:27.720]   So the owner of the pet just literally copied and pasted the lab result for the blood test for the
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:33.240]   dog with all the lab values into chat GPT and said, what could this be like, what's your
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:40.200]   likely diagnosis? Chat GPT gave three possible answers, three illnesses. The first one was what
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:45.480]   the vet basically diagnosed with. So that wasn't it. The second one was excluded by another test.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:50.200]   So he then went to a second vet and said, listen, I think my dog has the third one.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:57.880]   And vet prescribed something and sure enough, dog is cured, saved. So that's really mind blowing
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:04.120]   that even though chat GPT hasn't been specifically optimized, as far as we know, for lab results,
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.400]   it could figure this out. The reason I'm mentioning this is it gives you a sense of
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:13.880]   the potential here to cure disease to, you know, like I could see major medical breakthroughs
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:19.400]   based on the AI in the next five or 10 years. Now, the question is, like, what happens in
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.960]   the long term, you know, as the AI gets smarter and smarter, and we are kind of getting
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.960]   into the realm of science fiction, but here would be the scenario is you're on
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:35.800]   chat GPT 10, or 20, or whatever it is, or maybe some other companies AI. And the developers asked
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:41.640]   the AI, hey, how could you make yourself better? Now do it? Which is a question we asked chat GPT
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:47.400]   all the time in different contexts. And so chat GPT will already have the ability to write perfect
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.040]   code by that point. I think, you know, code writing is one of the I think of its superpowers already.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:57.880]   So it gives itself the ability to rewrite its code to auto update it to recursively make itself
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:04.200]   better. I mean, at that point, isn't that like a speciation event doesn't that very quickly lead
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:10.440]   to the singularity if the AI has the capability to rewrite its own code to make itself better?
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.200]   And you know, won't it very quickly write billions of versions of itself.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:19.320]   And, you know, it's very hard to predict what that future looks like. Now, I also don't know
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.680]   how far away we are from that that could be 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, whatever.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.600]   But I think it's a question worth asking for sure.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.880]   Is it worth slowing down, though, sex? Should we be pausing because, based on what you said,
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.200]   you know, I think you've framed it properly. When these things hit a certain point, and they start
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:42.120]   reinforcing their own learning with each other, they can go at infinite speed, right? This is not
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:47.400]   comparable to human speed, they could be firing off millions, billions of different I think you're
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:54.600]   right scenarios. We're definitely now on this fuck around, find out curve. Yeah. And so there's only
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:55:00.120]   one way to really find out which is somebody is going to push the boundaries, the competitive
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   dynamics will get the better of some startup, they'll do something that people will look back
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:11.320]   on and say, Whoa, that was a little that was a bridge too far. So yeah, we're just a matter of
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:16.120]   time. Yeah, I think we're not going to slow down. I actually think it's going the other way. I think
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.280]   things are going to speed up. And the reason they're going to speed up is because the one
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:25.320]   thing Silicon Valley is really good at is taking advantage of a platform shift. And so when you
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:31.480]   think about like all the VCs, and all the founders, you know, everyone accuses us of being lemmings.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   And so when there's like kind of like a fake platform shift, or people kind of glom on to
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:42.120]   something that ends up not being real, everyone's kind of got egg on their faces. But the flip side
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:47.560]   of that is that when the platform shift is real, Silicon Valley is really good at throwing money
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:53.720]   at it, the talent knows how to go after it. And they keep making it better and better. And so
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:58.120]   that's the dynamic we're in right now. You look at 70% of the last YC class was ready all AI
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:04.360]   startups for the next one probably 95%. So I think that we're on a path here where the pace of
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:08.520]   innovation is actually going to speed up. Companies are going to compete with each other, they're
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:13.960]   going to seek to invent new capabilities. And I think the results are going to all be incredibly
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:18.280]   positive for some period of time, like you know, the vet example, we're going to cure
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:25.320]   illnesses, we're going to solve major problems are positive, then we invest more, we trust more.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:29.720]   But the paradox of that as Chamath is pointing out, Friedberg is if we trust it more, we invest
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.360]   more than some person in a free market is going to say, you know what, I need to be
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.440]   chat GPT. Therefore, I'm going to take the rails off this thing, I'm going to let it go
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:43.080]   faster, and take off some constraints, because I need to win. And I'm so far behind.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:47.400]   How do you feel about that scenario that sort of Chamath and
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:57.320]   Saks T. Dep Friedberg, I think there's like, GPT three, I think ran on 700 gigs. Is that right?
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:03.800]   Does anyone know what GPT four runs on? It's got to be on some number that's, you know, not too
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:12.840]   not not many multiples of that. But look, someone could make a copy of this thing and fork it and
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:20.600]   develop an entirely new model. I think that's what's incredible about software and digital
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:26.760]   technology and also kind of, you know, means that it's very hard to contain. Similar to like what
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:32.920]   we've seen in biology ever since biology got digitized through DNA sequencing, and the ability
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:39.720]   to kind of express molecules through gene editing. You know, you can't control or contain the ability
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:46.280]   to do gene editing work at all. Because everyone knows the code. Everyone can make CRISPR cast
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:51.480]   molecules, everyone can make gene editing systems in any lab anywhere. Once it was out, it was out.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:57.240]   And now there's hundreds of variants for doing gene editing, many of which are much improved
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:01.480]   over CRISPR cast nine, I use that as an analogy, because it was this breakthrough technology that
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:06.120]   allowed us to precisely, specifically edit genomes. And that allowed us to engineer biology and do
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:11.160]   these incredible things where biology effectively became software. And remember, CRISPR cast nine
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:18.280]   gave us effectively a word processing type tool find and replace. And the tooling that's evolved
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   from that is much better. So whatever is underlying, whatever the parameters are for GPT for
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:32.680]   whatever that model is, if a close enough replicant of that model exists, or a copy of that model is
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:37.960]   made, and then new training data and new evolutions can be done separately, you could see many, many
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   variants kind of emerge from here. And I think this is a good echoing of chumas point, we don't
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:46.440]   know what's ultimately going to win. Is there enough of a network effect in the plugin model,
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:51.560]   as Saks pointed out, to really give open AI the sustaining competitive advantage? I'm not sure.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:58.200]   The model runs on 700 gigs. That's less data than, you know, fits on my iPhone. So you know,
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.720]   I could take that model, I could take the parameters of that model. And I could create
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.680]   an entirely new version, I could fork it, and I could do something entirely new with it.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:10.200]   So I don't think you can contain it. I don't think that this idea that we can put in place,
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:17.080]   some regulatory constraints and say, it's illegal to do this, or, you know, try and,
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.480]   you know, create IP around it, or protections around it is realistic at this state,
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:25.960]   the power of the tool is so extraordinary, the extendability of the tools are so extraordinary.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:32.520]   So the economic and the various incentives are there for, you know, other models to emerge,
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:37.080]   and whether they're directly copied from someone hacking into open AI servers and making a copy of
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:40.760]   that model, or whether they're, you know, open sourced, or whether that someone generates
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:45.720]   something that's 95% is good, and then it forks and a whole new class of models emerge.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:52.200]   I think this is like, it's as Saks pointed out, highlighting the kind of economic, market
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:57.800]   uprooting, social uprooting potential, and many models will start to kind of come to market.
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.120]   What do we think the impact of white collar jobs getting annihilated by this technology,
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.840]   if that in fact, I want to say one thing on this. Yeah, look, I just share one example here. So
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.960]   here's a Reddit post that I was made aware of earlier this week. I lost everything that made
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:16.840]   me love my job through mid journey overnight. I am employed as a 3d artist and a small games
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:22.520]   company of 10 people. Our team is two people who basically explains he says since mid journey
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.800]   version five came out, he's not an artist anymore, nor a 3d artist. All they do is prompting
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.080]   photoshopping and implementing good looking pictures. And he basically says, this happened
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.120]   overnight, and he had no choices. Boss also had no choice. He says I am now able to create rig
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.640]   and animate a character that spit out from MJ mid journey in two to three days before it took
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.440]   us several weeks and 3d. The difference is that he cares about his you know, job and for his boss,
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.160]   it's just a huge time money saver. He's no longer making art and the person who was number two in
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:58.600]   the organization who didn't make as good content as him is now embracing this technology because
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:04.280]   it carries favor with his boss. And he ends basically saying, getting a job in the game
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:09.560]   industry is already hard, but leaving a company and a nice team because AI took my job feels very
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:14.520]   dystopian. I doubt it would be better in a different company. Also, I am between grief
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:20.200]   and anger and I am sorry for using my gosh, your art fellow artists. This is yet another reason
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:27.080]   that figma really needs to close this acquisition from Adobe. I mean, it's like, the value of these
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:33.480]   apps are just getting gutted. If you take a workflow management tool for things like design
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:40.200]   and imagery, and you reduce it by an order of 90% it's like what is that app experience worth?
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:47.240]   And how could you replicate it if you were a big company that already has distribution? That's one
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.560]   comment. But what I would tell you Jason to answer the white collar question is I think there are a
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:56.520]   handful of companies you need to look at exclusively because they will be the first ones to
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:02.840]   really figure out how to displace human labor. And that is TCS. So Tata Consulting Services,
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:10.920]   Accenture, Cognizant, these are all the folks that do coding for hire work at scale. I think
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:18.280]   Accenture has something like 750,000 employees. So the incentive to sort of squeeze op ex to
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:24.280]   create better utilization rates to increase profitability is quite obvious. It always has
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:29.240]   been they will be the first people to figure out how to use these tools at scale. Before the law
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.320]   firms or the accounting firms or any of those folks, even sort of try to figure out how to
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.760]   displace white collar labor, I think is going to be the coding jobs and it's going to be the coding
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.360]   for hire jobs that companies like Accenture and TCS. So those business processing do for other
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:48.120]   people, developer kind of folks, they're going to need half as many people 25% as many people,
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.440]   we're going to find out the efficient frontier. Yeah.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:56.200]   I see it a different way. I mean, this argument that productivity leads to job loss has been made
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:01.240]   for hundreds of years. And it's always been refuted. When you make human beings more productive,
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:07.080]   it leads to more prosperity, more wealth, growth, more growth. And so yeah, it's easy to think about
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.000]   in a narrow way, the jobs are going to be displaced. But but why would that be? It's
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.040]   because you're giving leverage to other human beings to get more done. And some of those human
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.840]   beings, really anybody with a good idea is now going to be able to create a startup much more
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:27.400]   easily. So you're going to see a huge explosion in creativity in startup creation, new companies,
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:33.480]   new jobs. Imagine think about the case of you know, Zuckerberg founding Facebook at Harvard,
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.520]   he wrote the first version himself, maybe with a couple of friends, that project happened and
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:44.360]   turned into a giant company because he was able to self execute his idea without needing to raise
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.520]   venture capital or even recruit employees. Even really before forming a company, anyone with a
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.280]   good idea to be able to do that soon, you're going to be able to use these AI tools, they truly
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:59.640]   will be no code, you'll be able to create an app or a website just by speaking to some AI program
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.440]   in a natural language way. So more flowers will bloom more startups, more projects. Now,
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:11.880]   it will create I think a lot of dislocation. But for every testimonial that is like the one that
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:17.960]   you showed, which I think is, I'd say a little bit overly dramatic, I have seen 10 or 100
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:24.280]   testimonials from coders on Twitter or other blogs, talking about the power that these new
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.320]   tools give them. They are like this makes me a 10x engineer, right? And, and especially these
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.400]   like junior engineers who are right out of school, who don't have 20 years of coding history,
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.160]   they get superpowers right away. Like it makes them so much better.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.200]   It's a proper response.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:45.160]   Let me give you a response to that guy. So so and using sexist point, that guy saying what used to
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.680]   take me weeks, I can now do in two to three days. And I feel like my work is gone. And that's because
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:56.360]   he's thinking in terms of his output being static. And if he thinks about his output being dynamic,
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:01.960]   he can now in the matter of three weeks, instead of making one character, he cannot make a character
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:07.400]   every two days. So he can make 30 characters in three weeks. That's an alternative way for him
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:12.360]   to think about what this tooling does for him and his business, the number of video games will go up
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:18.600]   by 10x, or 100x or 1000x. The number of movies and videos that can be rendered in computers can go up
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:25.000]   by 10x or 100x or 1000x. This is why I really believe strongly that in some period of time,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.880]   we will all have our own movie or our own video game ultimately generated for us on the fly.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.040]   Based on our particular interests, there will certainly be shared culture, shared themes,
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.840]   you know, shared morality, shared things that that tie all these things together.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:43.960]   And that will become the shared experience. But in terms of like us all consuming the same content,
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.680]   it will really like you with YouTube and Tick Tock, we're all consuming different stuff all the time.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:54.120]   And this will enable an acceleration of that evolution and personalization. I'll also highlight,
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:59.960]   you know, back in the day, one human had to farm a farm by hand. And we eventually got the tool of
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:05.400]   a hoe and we can put in the ground and make, you know, make stuff faster. And then we got a plow.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:13.240]   And then we got a tractor. And today, agricultural farm equipment allows one farmer to farm over 10,000
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.360]   acres, you go to Western Australia, it's incredible. These guys have 24 row planters
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.640]   and harvesters. And it's completely changed the game. So the unit of output per farmer
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.480]   is now literally millions of times what it was just 150 years ago.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:30.280]   And in that case, Freeberg, nobody wants to do backbreaking labor in the fields. And everybody
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:34.520]   wants that cheaper food. But in this case, let me just read you one quote that I didn't read in the
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:39.960]   original reading of this. He says, I want to make art that isn't the result of scraped internet
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.920]   content from artists that were not asked. And so I think that's part of this is that it's bespoke
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:51.720]   art. But the one question I have for sacks was, sacks, you we started this conversation, we're
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.640]   saying, hey, this is different than anything in terms of efficiency that came before it. This is,
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:00.520]   I'm going to put some words in my theory, but this is like a step function, more efficient. So
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:07.640]   to the argument of, hey, efficiency has always resulted in, you know, more ideas, and we've
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.240]   found something to do with people's time, is this time different, potentially,
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.360]   because this is so much more powerful. This isn't just like a spellchecker.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:18.360]   I would say differently, I think, and I agree with what J. Cal is saying, because I think that
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:27.320]   the thing that technology has never done is tried to displace human judgment. It's allowed us to
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:37.000]   replace physical exertion of energy, but it has always preserved humans injecting our judgment.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.440]   And I think this is the first time where we're being challenged with autonomous systems
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:47.560]   that has some level of judgment. Now we can say, and it's true,
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.320]   again, we're four months in that that judgment isn't so great. But eventually,
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.480]   and because of the pace of innovation, eventually is probably not that far away.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.520]   To judgment will become perfect. I'll give you a totally different example. You know,
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:09.320]   how many pilots are there in the world? Will we, at some point in the next 10 years, want
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:16.680]   folks to actually manually take off and land? Or will we want precision guided instrumentation and
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.800]   computers and sensors that can guarantee a pitch perfect landing every single time in all kinds of
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:28.520]   weather conditions so that now planes can even have 50 x the number of sensors with a computer
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.840]   that can then process it and act accordingly. Just a random example that isn't even thought
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:38.120]   of when we talk about sort of where AI is going to rear its head. I think that this judgment idea
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:43.160]   is an important one to figure out. Because this is the first time I've seen something that is
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.240]   bumping up against our ability to have judgment. And what this person was talking about in this
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:53.320]   mid journey example is his judgment has been usurped. Yes. Yeah, I would disagree.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:59.720]   I don't know. Yeah, let me just let me just make one point on this. So, you know, an image is a
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.480]   matrix of, you know, data that's rendered on a screen and as pixels and those pixels are different
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:11.000]   colors. And, you know, that's what an image is. Is it or is it is it the judgment of the creator?
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.240]   Well, no, I'm just saying an image in general. So like when Adobe Photoshop and digital photography
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.200]   arose, photographers were like, this is, you know, BS, why are you digitizing photography
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:25.080]   was analog and beautiful before. And then what digital photography allowed is the photographer
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:30.920]   to do editing and to do work that was creative beyond what was possible with just a natural
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.600]   photograph taken through a camera. And they're arguably different art forms, but it was a new
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.840]   kind of art form that emerged through digital photography. And then in the early 90s, there
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:44.920]   was a plugin suite called Kai's power tools that came out in Adobe Photoshop. And it was a third
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:49.080]   party plugin set, you would you would buy it and then it would work on Photoshop and it did things
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:54.680]   like motion blur, sharpening, pixelation, all these interesting kind of like features. And
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:59.480]   prior to those tools coming out, the judgment of the digital artist, the digital photographer was
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:04.600]   to go in and do pixel by pixel changes on the image to make that pixel to make that image look
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.840]   blurry, or to make it look sharper, or to make it look like it had some really interesting motion
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:14.200]   feature. And the Kai's power tools created this instant toolkit where in a few seconds, you
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.160]   created a blur on the image. And that was an incredible toolkit. But a lot of digital artists
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.280]   said, this is automating my work. What is my point now? Why am I here? And the same happened in
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.760]   animation when three when you know, CGI came around, and animators were no longer animating
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:33.880]   cells by hand. And in every point in this evolution, there was a feeling of loss initially,
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.040]   but then the evolution of a whole new art form emerged, and an evolution of a whole new area of
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.280]   human creative expression emerged. And I think we don't yet know what that's going to look like.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:49.160]   Do you think you think the the level of judgment that AI offers you is the same as the level of
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.600]   judgment that Kai power tools offered? Yeah, look, I mean, I think that the person making
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.600]   the judgment or the decision about which pixel to change into what color felt like, you know,
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.840]   I have control. And I think it's ultimately like, I just told her I disagree with you. I mean,
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.480]   I think that this is a magnitude different number. It's more of a magnitude. Yeah,
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:11.800]   it's still love. It's on you. You don't look nice. You and I have sat in spreadsheets. And
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.920]   we've I'm generally happy with this idea. So I'll give you a different example.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:22.600]   Today, we use radiologists and pathologists to identify cancers. Yep. There are closed loop
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.240]   systems. We have one right now that's in front of the FDA. That is a total closed loop system
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:33.000]   that will not need any human input. So I don't know what those folks do.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:40.600]   Except what I can tell you is that we can get cancer detection, basically down to a 0% error
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:48.040]   rate. That is not possible with human intervention. That is judgment. Right? So I just think it's
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.200]   important to really acknowledge that this is happening at a level that it's never happened
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:58.040]   before. You may be right that there's some amazing job for that radiologist or pathologist to do in
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:04.360]   the future. I don't know offhand what that is. But these are closed loop systems now,
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.760]   that think for themselves and self improve. I get it. But I think that there there is an
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:14.360]   unfathomable set of things that emerge. We did not have the concept of Instagram influencers,
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.800]   we did not have the concept of personal trainers, we did not have the concept of like,
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:25.000]   all these new jobs that have emerged in the past couple of decades, that people enjoy doing that
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.800]   they can make money doing that is a greater kind of experience and level of fulfillment for those
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.200]   that choose and have the freedom to do it than what they were having to do before, when they
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.680]   had to work just to make money. What do you think that radiologist or pathologist wants to do?
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.600]   Be a trainer or Pilates instructor? No, I think that's gonna look like
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:48.120]   all right, Sam. Yeah. You have any thoughts on this? As we wrap this topic? It's obviously a
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:52.760]   lot of passion coming out. Yeah. Elimination of white collar jobs in a massive way.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:57.240]   I think that this is a short term versus long term thing. In the short term, I see the benefits
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   of AI being very positive, because I don't think it's in most cases, wiping out human jobs is
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.960]   making them way more productive. You still need the developer. It says that there are five times
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.600]   or 10x more productive. But I don't think we're at the point in the short term, we're gonna be
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.800]   able to eliminate that role entirely. What I've seen in basically every startup I've ever been
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:23.800]   a part of is that the limiting factor on progress is always engineering bandwidth. That is always
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.760]   the thing that you wish you had more of. Totally.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.000]   It's the product roadmap is always the most competed on thing inside the organization.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.080]   Everyone's trying to get their project prioritized, because there's just never
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.240]   enough engineering bandwidth. It's really the lifeblood of the company. If you make
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.680]   the developers more productive, it maybe just accelerates the product roadmap.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:47.800]   I don't think in the short term that what's going to happen is these companies are going to look to
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.360]   cut all their developers because one or two of them can do 10x the work. I think that they're
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:58.280]   going to try and accelerate their product roadmaps. Now, again, you have this long term concern that
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.640]   maybe you don't need developers at all at some point. But I think that the benefits of developing
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.720]   this technology are so great in the short to midterm that we're going down that path no matter
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.480]   what. And we're just gonna have to find out what that long term really looks like. And maybe
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:16.520]   will look very different. I mean, once we get past the short term,
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:21.560]   we may have a different long term view. I think in this narrow vertical, I 100%
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:26.600]   agree with you. Look, I think that AI is going to eliminate unit testing, it has already done.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.560]   So it's going to eliminate most forms of coding, the engineers that you have, all of them will now
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:37.480]   become 10x engineers. So with fewer of them, or with the same number, you'll be able to do as much
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.840]   or more than you could have before. That's a wonderful thing. And all I'm saying on that
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:46.040]   specific narrow vertical is you'll see it first rear its head in companies like Accenture and TCS
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:52.760]   because and cognizant because they have an immediate incentive to use this tooling to drive
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.040]   efficiency and profitability that's rewarded by shareholders. It'll be less visible in other
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.280]   companies. So but what I am saying, though, is that you have to think about the impact
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:10.280]   on the end markets for a second. And I think that AI does something that other technology layers
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:15.960]   have never done before, which is supplant human judgment in a closed loop manner. And I just think
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:21.320]   it's worth appreciating that there are many systems and many jobs that reply that rely on human
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:30.840]   judgment. Where we deal with error bars, and an error rate that a computer will just destroy and
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:36.760]   blow out of the water. And we will have to ask ourselves, should this class of job exist with
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.960]   its inherent error rate? Or should it get replaced fully by a computer which has no error rate? And
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.440]   I think that's an important question that's worth putting on the table.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.440]   Okay, so let's wrap here. I just have my final thought on it is like, you're going to see
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.760]   entire jobs, categories of jobs go away. We've seen this before phone operators, travel agents,
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.840]   copy editors, illustrators, logo designers, accountants, sales development reps, I'm seeing
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:04.920]   a lot of these job functions in the modern world, like phone operators previously, I think these
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.840]   could wholesale just go away. And they would just be done by AI. And I think it's going to happen
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:13.160]   in a very short period of time. And so it's gonna be about who can transition. And some people might
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.720]   not be able to make the transition. And that's going to be pain and suffering. And it's going
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.960]   to be in the white collar ranks. And those people have more influence. So I think this is could
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:25.160]   lead to some societal disturbance. I'm going to learn Pilates and be an influencer.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.000]   That's it. But I do agree with sacks that the software development backlog, if this is what
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.160]   you're saying is so great, that I don't think we'll see it in software development for a decade
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.200]   or two. There's just so much software that still needs to be made. All right, last week, we talked
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.640]   about Tick Tock. And this first bipartisan hearing we've seen in a long time. And people actually,
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.280]   I think framing correctly exactly how dangerous it is, in my opinion, to have Tick Tock in the
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:52.520]   United States. And of course, then we get the great disappointment of the actual bill,
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:59.000]   the restrict act was proposed by Senator Mark Warner, Democrat Virginia, on March 7. The problem
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.600]   with it is, is it seems like it's poorly worded, that there will be civil penalties and criminal
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:12.280]   penalties to Americans for breaking the law and using software that's been banned. And many people
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:17.640]   said, you know, this probably is just bad language. I have a question. Yeah, does it does
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:25.400]   this apply to incognito mode? Because if it doesn't, I don't know, it is not. Yes. They're
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:30.440]   saying they're saying that you can get, you know, you can get fined or 20 years in jail, whatever it
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:36.200]   is, for using a VPN VPN to Tick Tock. Freeberg, what are your thoughts on it? Look, I think this
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   is a real threat to the open internet. I'm really concerned about the language that's been used
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.040]   that basically speaks to protecting the safety and security of the American people
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:51.480]   by actively monitoring network traffic, and making decisions about what network traffic
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:56.120]   is and isn't allowed to be transmitted across the open internet. It's the first time that I
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.600]   think in the United States, we are seeing like a real threat and a real set of behaviors from our
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.960]   government that looks and feels a lot like what goes on in China and elsewhere, where they operate
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:11.640]   with a closed internet and internet that's controlled, monitored, observed, tracked, and,
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:17.160]   and gates are decided by some set of administrators on what is and isn't appropriate. And the language
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:22.120]   is always the same. It's for safety and security of the people. The entire purpose of the internet
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:26.120]   is that it did not have bounds that it did not have governments that it did not have controls
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.160]   that it did not have systems that are politically and economically influenced that the architecture
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.880]   of the internet was and always would be open. The protocols are open, the transmission of data on
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:40.600]   that network would be open. And as a result, all people around the world would have access to
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:45.880]   information of their choosing, and it allowed ultimate freedom of choice. You know, this,
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.520]   this kind of is the first of what I'm concerned, creates a precedent that ultimately leads to a
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.560]   very slippery slope, saying that tick tock cannot make money in the US by charging advertisers or
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.720]   managing commerce flows is one thing. That's where the government can and should and could,
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:04.840]   if they chose to have a role. But I think going in and observing tracking internet traffic and
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:10.280]   making decisions about what is and isn't appropriate for people, I think, is one of the
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.240]   things that we all should be most concerned about what's going on right now. There is no end in sight
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:21.880]   to this. If you allow this to happen in the first time, you know, VPNs, virtual private networks,
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:29.240]   allow you to anonymously access internet traffic and and access internet traffic via remote
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:36.520]   destinations. So, so that the ultimate consumption of content that you're using can't be tracked and
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:42.680]   monitored by local agencies or ISPs. And I think that saying that that can now be restricted,
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:48.120]   takes away all ability to have true privacy and all rights to privacy on the open internet.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.400]   So I'd love to talk about this more. Unfortunately, I got to run.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:56.680]   Great. So this is a super threat to me. And I think this is something we should be super,
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:01.560]   super concerned about. And that the entire community of technology, internet, and anyone
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:06.520]   that wants to have, you know, freedom of choice, steps up and says, this is totally inappropriate
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.080]   and overreach. Yeah, there are other ways to manage stuff like this.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.080]   Feels like complete overreach, Sax.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.760]   Yeah, I agree with this.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.880]   Intentional overreach or poorly written or somewhere in between? What do you think?
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:20.360]   Both. I think both. I think this is the biggest bait and switch that Washington,
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.600]   the central government has ever tried to pull on us. Everybody thinks that they're just trying to
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:29.400]   ban TikTok from operating in the US. And if that's all they did, then I think the bill would be
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:33.560]   supported by most Americans. But that's not what they're doing. They're not restricting TikTok,
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.680]   they're restricting us.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:38.360]   That's not the goal here. Yeah. What a bait and switch.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:42.920]   It's a huge bait and switch. And so just so you know, what the act provides is that a US citizen
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:49.320]   using a VPN to access TikTok could theoretically be subjected to a maximum penalty of 1 million
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:57.000]   in fines or 20 years in prison or both. Now, they'll say, Mark Warner, the sponsor of legislation,
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.160]   will swear up and down. That's not the intent. But the problem is that the language of the bill
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:05.720]   is so vague that some clever prosecutor may want to pursue this theory one day.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:10.520]   And that needs to be stopped. Also, there's another problem with the bill, which is,
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:17.240]   you think this is just about TikTok. It's not. What they do is, it says here, I guess they don't
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:22.360]   want to mention TikTok by name. So they're trying to create a category of threatening application.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:29.320]   But because it is a category, it's very, very broad. So the bill states that it covers any
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:35.560]   transaction, transaction, not just an app, in which an entity described in subparagraph B has
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.680]   any interest. And then entities described in subparagraph B are, quote, a foreign adversary,
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:45.240]   an entity subject to the jurisdiction of or organizing the laws of a foreign adversary,
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:50.520]   an entity owned, directed, or controlled by either of these. And then it gives the executive branch
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:58.040]   the power to name a foreign adversary, any foreign government regime that one of the cabinet
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:04.920]   secretaries defines, without any vote of Congress. So this is giving sweeping powers to the executive
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:11.240]   branch to declare foreign companies to be enemies. It feels like the plot of the prequels in Star
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:16.760]   Wars. Well, like T-Power, here we go. You know, we criticize China for having a great firewall.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:21.960]   What do you think this is? Yeah, I mean, this should obviously have nothing to do with the
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.120]   American consumer and everything to do with a foreign adversary collecting data of Americans
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.520]   at scale. This could be written in a much simpler way. Yeah, you know what it should be? It should
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:36.760]   be one sentence, which is that app stores are prohibited from allowing TikTok to be an app
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   in their store. That's what they do in India. That's it. Case closed. Game over. I think India
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:45.080]   is doing okay, right? They block like 100 Chinese apps, and I think their society is still functioning.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:51.080]   So, you know, all due respect to AOC, you know, like the idea that 150 million Americans are
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:55.480]   going to suffer because they can't be tracked by the CCP is kind of nuts. This is going to give
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:05.080]   sweeping powers to the security state to surveil us, to prosecute us, to limit our internet usage.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.880]   This is basically the biggest power grab and bait and switch they've ever tried to pull on us.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.560]   And again, if they really were concerned about TikTok, it's one sentence.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.040]   Yeah, we were done. All right, everybody. It's been an amazing episode for the
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.840]   Sultan of Science, David Freeburg, the Rain Man himself, David Sachs, and the dictator,
