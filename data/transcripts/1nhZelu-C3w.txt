[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]   If I can get a dramatically lower rate off a seven-year arm, they
[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.060]   call it adjustable rate mortgage, a seven or 10 year.
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.940]   Yeah.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.620]   I like that idea.
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.620]   Here's what I don't like though.
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.180]   What happened in '07, '08, right?
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.620]   Is people have these adjustable mortgages for the same reason
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.720]   like that we're having today.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.300]   And so they'd get the arm because it was cheaper.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.140]   And then when the market collapsed, the arm shot up to 28%.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.380]   So all of a sudden people's mortgages went from a thousand to $5,000.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.880]   And they lost their homes.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.620]   That has been changed.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.680]   There are now limits on what an arm can do.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.660]   A lot of people don't realize this.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.660]   They think, oh, I would never get an adjustable rate mortgage.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.020]   Cause I don't want '08 to happen again.
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.860]   Well, if you look at the paperwork and talk to your lenders, yeah, most
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.820]   arms have a max what they can get to.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.900]   And it's somewhere in the, like the 11, 12% range.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.520]   So I, yeah, could rates stay high forever.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.260]   And then your adjustable rate seven years from now goes up to 12%.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.300]   That is possible.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.220]   That is a risk.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.920]   So if you really don't like risk, take a 30 year mortgage.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.500]   You can refinance a 30 year mortgage too.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.620]   But if you want to lower your interest rate and take a little gamble,
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.340]   that's what I typically do.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.740]   Yeah.
