[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:51.080]   in the right direction.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.080]   As of today's date, which is February 26, 2021, I have 22 recorded episodes, which means
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.360]   at the rate I'm going now, I could release new episodes without creating more into 2022.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.720]   Once I realized that, I sort of pulled the brakes a little bit since I needed a break
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.300]   from podcasting anyway, specifically the script writing portion.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.880]   I bring that up because you might start to see bonus episodes here and there, which is
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.040]   what this is, and they're bonus episodes for the reasons I just explained.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.440]   But what I wanted to do with these bonus episodes, and some of these bonus episodes I'm going
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.080]   to call side notes, is to address events that are a little bit more current.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.680]   I want to apologize for the audio quality.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.920]   I don't have the capability to have good audio quality when it comes to having more than
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.320]   one person on a mic because of hardware reasons, but if we end up doing more of these, perhaps
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.260]   that might change.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.320]   What you're going to hear is an informal discussion I have with Pastor Peter, Pastor Peter Kim,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.740]   about the whole Ravi Zacharias scandal.
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.040]   We don't cover every single aspect of it, but some good portions of it and some of the
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.200]   broader questions that people seem to have.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.840]   Have a listen and enjoy.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.560]   Marine Community Church, I am here once again with Pastor Peter.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.040]   I dragged him here.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.960]   I thought it might be helpful if we did one of those recorded informal discussion times
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.940]   like we did with the one concerning politics right before the election.
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.420]   That was when John Piper, if you recall, John Piper came out with a blog and then Wayne
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.820]   Grudem came out with a blog, and then several people reached out to different people in
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.820]   leadership.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.140]   So we just thought it might be a good idea just to have an extended conversation recorded
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.260]   and then share it with the church.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:55.220]   This is one of those times again, except the subject matter is now involving Ravi Zacharias.
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.220]   Several people, just like the last time, have reached out to different people in leadership,
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.180]   have asked us what we thought.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.780]   So we thought, in the same vein of thinking, we thought it might be helpful if we just
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.700]   again have an informal conversation that's recorded to provide some insight for anyone
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:27.100]   that would be confused, anyone who wants to put together the pieces, so to speak, because
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.660]   he was somewhat of a prominent figure within Christendom.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.720]   I know many of you might not know who Ravi Zacharias is.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.060]   I'll spend a little bit of time just building up what we're going to talk about.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.460]   Ravi Zacharias was a prominent Christian apologist.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.860]   You can think of a modern day C.S. Lewis.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.260]   His ministry had become international.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.960]   They had headquarters in various countries and apologists based in those headquarters.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.300]   They were receiving, I think, in millions in terms of donations.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.000]   Up until recently, they had another main office in the U.K. specifically devoted to a school
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.780]   for apologetics called the Oxford Center for Christian Apologetics.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.140]   Ravi Zacharias himself lectured in various college campuses, including the Ivy League
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.420]   campuses during forums called the Veritas Forum.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.180]   He would come and he would defend the Christian faith.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.780]   These schools included Harvard and Yale.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.980]   He's written numerous books, tons of lectures.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.480]   I've read the vast majority of his books.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.060]   I've listened to the vast majority of his lectures.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.900]   They're like hybrid sermons, lectures.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.380]   He's spoken at megachurches throughout his entire career.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.580]   He also notably in 2000 spoke at the Mormon Tabernacle.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.720]   Many people will say they came to faith because of him.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.260]   He made Christianity understandable in ways that very few people could.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.500]   At his funeral, you had people like Tim Tebow and Mike Pence eulogizing him.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.480]   You even had Kayleigh McEnany say kind words about him.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.740]   He was known as the quintessential gentleman when it came to debating.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.460]   He was extremely bright, but he was extremely kind as well.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.640]   He was the guy that everyone pointed to show you that Christianity is not just for fools.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.700]   It's for smart people as well.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.280]   You can be smart and you could also be a Christian.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.940]   People would point to him.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:50.940]   He made Christianity make sense in a world where you had a vast marketplace of ideas.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:58.900]   A couple years before his death, there were some things that were being talked about him.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.320]   There were some lawsuits that raised some eyebrows.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.900]   A couple years ago, a person by the name of Lorian Thompson alleged certain behavior.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.140]   It was settled with an NDA, so nobody really knew the details.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.220]   After his funeral, victims began to come forward one after another.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.420]   What's interesting is, initially, because it was after his death and he's not allowed
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:33.020]   to defend himself, it could easily be interpreted as picking on someone after they're dead.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.940]   But enough people came forward where it warranted an investigation.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:46.380]   RZIM, to their credit, contracted an independent agency.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.240]   That independent agency looked into the matter.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:58.500]   That investigation, they released preliminary findings a little bit before Christmas.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.060]   The preliminary findings were not good.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.880]   They were not good at all.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.840]   The preliminary findings alleged that Ravi Zacharias did indeed engage in inappropriate
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:16.860]   behavior, that he had owned various massage parlors, which was known by many people, maybe
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.500]   not to the public, but to many people within his circle.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.320]   The preliminary findings had indicated that it was certain that Ravi Zacharias was guilty
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.740]   of many of the things that the victims were saying.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.780]   A final report came out.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:43.300]   I think many people were perhaps holding out hope that the preliminary report was incorrect,
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.380]   but the final report came out not too long ago.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.200]   It was actually worse.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.380]   It was much worse than what the preliminary report said.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.780]   So I'll just kind of read off just a glimpse of the final report.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.300]   The final report stated that Ravi Zacharias was guilty of sexual abuse on many occasions
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.440]   in different places over a period of many years.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.380]   These involve not only women in the U.S., but also in Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.720]   and almost certainly other places.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.700]   The agency, Martin Miller, did not particularly investigate Asian and what he did on these
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.700]   trips, but he especially used those who worked in massage parlors, even importing them from
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.180]   overseas and seeking more than a massage.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.020]   In one example, he offered to take a masseuse to travel overseas with him.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.220]   He used RZIM ministry funds to fund his abuse.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.860]   He will give masseurs large gifts or pay them financially.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:46.000]   Or received monthly supports from RZIM's charity for the poor for a lengthy period of time.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.440]   He used the gospel and Christian language to gain the confidence of his victims.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.920]   Listen to this paragraph.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.680]   This witness told us that their relationship began as a normal massage therapist-client
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.280]   relationship, and she came to think of him as a father figure.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.020]   He elicited information about her faith and her financial situation.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.240]   She reported that after he arranged for the ministry to provide her with financial support,
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.420]   he required sex from her.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.800]   According to this witness, Mr. Zacharias used religious expressions to gain compliance as
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.060]   she was raised to be a person of faith.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.680]   She reported that he made her pray with him to thank God for the opportunity they both
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   received.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.860]   She said he called her his reward for living a life of service to God, and he referenced
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.800]   the godly men in the Bible with more than one wife.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.680]   She said he warned her not to ever speak out against him, or she would be responsible for
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:44.000]   the millions of souls whose salvation would be lost if his reputation was damaged.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   And I can go on just a little bit more.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.220]   Ravi owned at least two apartments in Bangkok.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:57.040]   On one occasion, he spent 256 days in one of those apartments and charged IZIM for rent.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.560]   Also, Ravi Zacharias is on record saying that he's never done anything appropriate in his
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.080]   45 years of marriage to his wife.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.120]   He said this, "In my 45 years of marriage to Margie, I have never engaged in inappropriate
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.860]   behavior of any kind."
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.720]   Just weeks after, this is the Lorian Thompson case, the case I referred to earlier about
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.640]   the non-disclosure agreement, the NDA.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.520]   Just weeks after the Thompson case, he was engaging with similar behavior with a Malaysian
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.560]   masseuse.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.080]   Now, Ravi Zacharias also carried with him, it was well known that he carried with him
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:36.520]   several phones, several phones with him so that on these different phones, they would
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.680]   not be connected to the Wi-Fi.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.400]   On these phones were found pictures.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:51.640]   We're talking hundreds of pictures, hundreds of pictures of different women on his phones.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:59.040]   So it's not just a testimony of different women in different regions of the world as
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.920]   if that weren't enough because the details were eerily similar, but they found pictures
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:13.960]   of hundreds of women on these phones and the digital corroboration, the physical evidence
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.360]   is insurmountable.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.800]   If you want to read the report for yourself, there's a 12-page report that you can find.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   To RZIM's credit, they contracted this agency to do the investigation, they released the
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:41.480]   findings publicly, and they have repudiated Ravi Zacharias' conduct.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.680]   We don't know anything outside of that with respect to how many people knew or didn't
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:52.080]   know or things like that, but this is, in a nutshell, what we know.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:01.440]   So Pastor Peter is here with me, I'm going to ask Pastor Peter an open-ended question.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.880]   Pastor Peter, what are we to make of all this?
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.520]   What are we to make of all this?
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:15.440]   Well, you know, when I first heard the news of Ravi Zacharias, I think it was about five
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   or six ago when the founding pastor of Willow Creek, Bill Hybels, was also accused of sexual
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:29.240]   misconduct and Ravi Zacharias' name actually came up during that time and because he didn't
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.960]   really get much press because of the non-disclosure agreement and then all the press went to Bill
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:41.200]   Hybel, and when I found out a few months later that Ravi Zacharias' case was just closed
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.760]   because of the non-disclosure agreement, I thought that was a very strange way to finish
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:53.240]   something like that, especially when his primary objective in life is to glorify God and to
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.200]   leave it as a question mark like that.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.960]   So I knew something fishy was already going on behind the scenes, it just didn't get the
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:06.120]   press so when all these facts did finally come out, yeah, I wasn't necessarily shocked
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:13.880]   by it and this is not the first time I've experienced somebody that was celebrated as
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.600]   a Christian, you know, apologist that fell, you know, and obviously there's tons of people
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:26.120]   that we could name but people that I've followed and known and heard and respected from a distance,
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.600]   I would say he's probably maybe about fifth or sixth person that I've seen in the last
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.840]   37, 38 years that I've been a Christian and so to me it's not a shock, you know, but it
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:43.440]   always tells me, you know, like the way that people come into ministry and once they come
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:50.520]   in especially somebody who's as influential as he is, to not have that kind of accountability
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.800]   and again it's hard for me to believe that people around him didn't know what was going
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:02.560]   on especially knowing just how elaborate this was and how long it's been, somebody somewhere
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   swept this under the rug.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:10.400]   So it wasn't just him that was doing this, somebody justified it, you know, he was surrounded
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.800]   by people who saw the impact that he was having and justified all his other behavior because
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:21.840]   of it, you know, and so when the Bible says the elder needs to be above reproach, you
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:28.240]   know, as much of a good thing that he did when he was alive, the damage that he has
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:35.320]   done is far greater than the good that he has done because of this and yeah, so, you
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.880]   know, I grieve over the impact that this is having on so many Christians but hopefully
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.920]   that at the least that people will come away from this realizing that all have sinned and
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.960]   fall short of the glory of God, there's no man who is above accountability.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:15:00.400]   Yeah, you know, Pastor Peter, you raise an interesting point when we talk about the qualification
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:08.480]   of an elder, you know, we look back at Ravi Zacharias' ministry and it wasn't done through
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:17.960]   a local church, it was, his ministry was done via corporation, you know, he was the CEO,
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:31.720]   he was the one in charge and it wasn't, you know, the system that was in place that RZIM
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:41.140]   used wasn't the makeup that's given to us in the scriptures.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:46.400]   In the scriptures, a church is led by elders and there's trust there between the elders
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.360]   and the congregation but the elders keep one another accountable and they're also accountable
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:59.800]   to the congregation as well but there are layers of accountability in place where in
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:07.040]   the case of Ravi Zacharias, I mean, he's walking around with multiple phones, you know, women
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:14.680]   are, I mean, I understand that he has a bad back but this woman, this masseuse is following
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   him around the globe, it's strange but do you think that contributed in any way, Pastor
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   Peter?
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.120]   >> Yeah, and I think God's wisdom, he did establish a local church, there's qualifications
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:35.080]   for elders, for deacons, he says to not to entertain a charge against an elder unless
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:40.320]   there's two or three witnesses so it doesn't say not to charge an elder but to do it very
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.960]   seriously and because the consequence of an elder who was living in sin because it's going
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.160]   to damage the whole church.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.760]   But to be fair, most of the people that I know who have fallen were local church pastors
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:01.880]   who embezzled money, who had affairs with their secretaries and so definitely the local
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.160]   church if practiced biblically is meant to have accountability.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.800]   We have plurality of elders, we have discipline that we're supposed to carry out, not to bring
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.640]   charges flippantly but if there is a serious charge, to take it seriously and to take it
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:25.440]   to the church but the problem right now is that the church itself, not just locally but
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.360]   globally is not healthy.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.160]   I think we've given to the goal of what we think is successful is if it grows, if many
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.400]   people get baptized then we're being successful so whatever means that we've used, whoever
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:48.940]   is being used for that end is excusable because we're seeing fruit but in the end ultimately
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:55.140]   what God calls us to do is to be faithful to what he teaches and so true fruit is going
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.600]   to always come from abiding in Christ and to abide in Christ obviously we have to abide
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.100]   by his word and so we can't just look at the end goal and to justify the means.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:11.720]   The means have to also be glorifying to God and I think all these things that we're seeing,
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.900]   it doesn't mean that if you follow what the Bible says it guarantees that we're not going
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:22.660]   to fall in sin but definitely when we don't follow it, it gives room for this type of
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.220]   stuff to happen and to sweep it under the rug so it's not just one.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:32.640]   There had to have been through 30-40 years of this man's ministry and we don't know how
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.840]   long this has been going on but there had to have been dozens and dozens of people who
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:45.420]   justified his behavior that allowed him to be able to go this far in his sin.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:19:00.240]   Yeah and humanly speaking I can't help but think if there were some brave souls who were
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:08.280]   part of his inner circle assuming he had an inner circle that saw this but it's quite
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:18.140]   probable that there was so whoever those hypothetical people are, if they had spoken truth in his
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.480]   life and if they had stuck by it, there are reports that someone brought it up to him
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.960]   but it looks like they were silenced but instead of just kind of being silenced like that,
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:35.440]   if they had maybe just pried a little more, I can't help but wonder if this could have
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:47.920]   been stemmed a lot earlier on but at the same time, if somebody wants to do something, it's
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.760]   ultimately not the fault of someone outside of us.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:20:01.320]   You know what is interesting to me about this situation is that he almost seemed like he
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.640]   knew that this was going to be exposed after he died because he made no effort to cover
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.880]   this up.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.280]   He only covered it up while he was alive so he's not a dummy.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.380]   He knew once he died what was on his computer on his phone was going to get exposed that
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.480]   all those people who made allegations, the hotels, the masseuse, that all of that was
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:27.160]   going to come out which makes me think that he wasn't a believer, that he said all of
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:33.360]   these things but he was not afraid of the consequence after he dies because an unbeliever
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.560]   will think well after I'm dead, I'm not here so it doesn't matter.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.160]   He's not thinking about the afterlife.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.760]   He's not thinking about the consequence afterwards.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.800]   So you know, I know many men who have fallen and have repented, whether the repentance
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:56.320]   is sincere or not, but his behavior is particularly grievous because everything that I've heard
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.980]   and read, it sounds like the mentality of an unbeliever.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.840]   And so for him to have the kind of impact that he had as an unbeliever in and of itself
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.800]   is something that we need to kind of take a step back and look at.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.560]   What caused this man to be effective?
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.000]   What was his message?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.400]   Why were so many people duped by this man, right?
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.960]   I mean, God could use donkeys to speak truth so it doesn't mean that there wasn't any truth
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:30.120]   coming out of this man but how did that many people not recognize that this man may not
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.600]   have been a Christian?
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:38.480]   Yeah I mean, you know, we had to take stock, you know.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:46.160]   I mentioned early on that I read a vast majority of his books and a vast majority of his lectures
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:53.160]   and I remember when this news came out and just kind of as an experiment, I listened
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:22:01.440]   to one of his older lectures and I listened to it with different ears, you know, just
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.400]   completely different ears now that I know him, you know.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:11.480]   And I think, you know, looking back in my mind, I just viewed him as an apologist, you
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:17.880]   know, not as a, not necessarily as someone I'm going to receive biblical truth from.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:24.640]   Not that he didn't, not that that wasn't present at all but that wasn't, to me I didn't see
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.720]   him as that goal but the problem is, but the problem is this, right?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.520]   Truth is truth, you know, truth is truth, period, you know.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:41.000]   And so these questions of like, what did he actually say?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.720]   What did he actually believe?
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.000]   These are fair questions that need to be answered, you know.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:57.440]   And I know for myself, I've given seekers in the past, I've given some seekers some
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.600]   of his books like, "Hey, you know, what book would you recommend if I want to find out
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.200]   more about Jesus?"
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.680]   And to one particular person, I gave them Jesus Among Other Gods.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:13.120]   Now as I'm sitting here right now, I do wish I didn't do that, of course, you know.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:26.240]   But it's reinforcing just, in my mind, the necessity of core truths that we need to absolutely
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:34.480]   fight for and no matter how eloquent you are or how smart you are, nobody is above that.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.440]   Clearly not even Ravi Zacharias, you know.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:50.760]   So Pastor Peter, I want to ask you, for going forward, going forward, I don't think we say,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.880]   "Well, you know, I don't know this guy personally so I'm not gonna listen to him.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.720]   I don't know, you know, I don't know Steve Lawson personally.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.680]   I don't know what's going on in his life so I'm not gonna listen to him."
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:07.360]   Because you and I would agree, in theory, someone even as solid as Steve Lawson, we
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.040]   don't know their life so in theory, they could be someone else.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   I don't think he is.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.800]   Obviously, I'm not saying that.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.520]   But that could be true, you know, in a hypothetical vacuum.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.920]   You know, we don't know anybody, right?
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.360]   And then the other layer to that is we can look at each other.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.400]   I don't know you.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.920]   Are you telling me the truth and start, you know, having this, like, you know, in the
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.480]   spirit of being discerning, kind of take it too far, you know?
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.320]   So what are your thoughts on that, Pastor Peter?
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:42.240]   You know, I think Jonathan Edwards in his book, Religious Affection, you know, he basically
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.560]   writes like half of the book is about, you know, fake affection.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.160]   Like you can go to church and be fake.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.920]   You can be a leader and be fake.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.340]   You can be knowledgeable and be fake.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.240]   You can bear fruit, at least seemingly, and be fake.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.160]   And so he basically tears down everything that we would measure as, like, that's a godly
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   man.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   That's a man who's a Christian.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.320]   And then the second part of it, he builds up and says, well, this is what true affection
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.360]   looks like.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.600]   And the reason why he wrote that book is because the Great Awakening was happening and there
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.180]   was a lot of charismatic things that were happening.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.480]   And so you had one group saying that that was all from God.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.160]   And then you had another group saying, like, that's all from the devil.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.240]   That's not from God.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.160]   And that's why he was sifting through to just biblically.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.680]   So he goes after passage, after passage, after passage.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.200]   And one thing that really stood out to me in his main point in his second part of the
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:39.960]   book is the primary and the most important evidence of genuine faith is his true affection
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.240]   for Christ.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:48.200]   And that's why he, like his, the evidence that his eyes were open to God's glory was
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.860]   his affection, right?
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.920]   And so he starts to break down that, what does that affection look like, right?
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   In worship.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   What does that affection look like in preaching?
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.140]   What does that affection look like in life, in evangelism?
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.360]   And so he kind of deconstructs and then rebuilds up.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.640]   But like I said, the primary thing that really struck me was, you know, it's so simple that
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.520]   the Bible says, you know, the greatest thing that God desires is to love the Lord your
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.640]   God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.320]   With apologetics, the emphasis is on the mind.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.160]   You know, with charismatics, the emphasis is on your emotions, you know.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.960]   With the discipleship movement, the emphasis is on your will and discipline.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:37.120]   But there's a reason why I think all of that is covered because true affection requires
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.200]   all of it.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.500]   You never detach your emotion, you never detach your mind, you never detach your will.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.720]   Like when there is genuine love for Christ, you see the evidence of that in all aspects
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.080]   of your life, not just one aspect.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.320]   And so, but at the core of that is not how smart somebody is, how disciplined somebody
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:01.560]   is, or how passionate somebody is, but how is the affection for Christ evidenced in his
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   passion?
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:08.520]   How is the affection for Christ evidenced in his discipline and his study in theology?
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.200]   And so it doesn't mean, so we're never going to be perfect in our discernment, you know,
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.600]   because only God will know truly what's in man's heart.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.380]   If before this happened, if anybody asked us, like, "Oh, we're questioning Ravi Zacharias,"
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.880]   how many people would have questioned him?
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   Zero.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.480]   Only it's because all this has been laid out, right?
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:34.120]   But I'm always weary when I think of people who are up on the stage, you know, and God
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:41.360]   is obviously using them for a purpose, but there's always an alternate motive when somebody
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.840]   is celebrated in public, like whether they become wealthy because they wrote a book,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.760]   or they're treated, and people line up just to be near this person.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.080]   And so they're human.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:02.600]   So whenever someone is celebrated by earthly standards, you know that they're struggling
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   internally, even if they are a genuine believer, genuinely being used by God, they're struggling
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.680]   with that desire to touch some of that glory.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.840]   There's a reason why Christ put a thorn on Apostle Paul's side, and he said the only
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.520]   reason why he did it is to keep him humble because God was using him, you know.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:28.940]   And so for me as a pastor, I'm always weary of that because, you know, the more "success"
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.880]   that I or our church experiences, there's always that temptation to be proud and to
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.600]   think that, you know, what we're doing is right.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:44.160]   God is using us, and then once that pride gets in, that's the beginning of the unraveling
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.080]   of everything else, you know.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:52.720]   And so I don't think we have ultimately the true discernment to be able to say, you know,
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.600]   with absolute certainty, "This man is somebody that we trust.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.320]   This man isn't somebody that we don't trust."
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.680]   I think as a general rule, we always believe that all have sinned and fall short of the
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   glory of God.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   And the same pride you struggle with, He struggles with.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.160]   Same temptation you struggle with, He struggles with, you know.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:18.520]   So to be discerning in the way that we are looking for the affection for Christ, does
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.220]   He have me to love Christ, right?
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.760]   And if He does, great, you know.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.960]   And to me personally, Rabbi Zacharias was not, I wasn't never like a, I had nothing
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.240]   against him, but I just didn't have that kind of affinity to him.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.760]   So it didn't affect me that much.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:42.200]   And I've had enough people when I was younger that I really looked up to fall, where I'm
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.240]   kind of, you know, like, not only can they fall, I can fall.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:52.400]   So if I know that I can fall, I'm not going to be shocked that they fall, you know.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.880]   But like you said, the truth is the truth.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.360]   It doesn't diminish the Word of God at all.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:03.240]   If anything, to me, it brings my attention back to God's Word, right?
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.520]   Where I truly get fed is not through the presentation, but the content, right?
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.440]   Even if it comes through a man like Rabbi Zacharias.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.080]   I can read, I can still read his books.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:20.560]   I can still be blessed by certain things that he said, you know, even if it did come through
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.800]   a man like him.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:30.320]   Yeah, you know, it's, you know, I'm reminded when you say that, Pastor Peter, I'm reminded
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:36.080]   of James chapter one, you know, where, you know, when we think about wisdom, we think
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.040]   about getting wisdom.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.680]   Sometimes our inclination is to just build principles, okay, I learned this.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.320]   So I'm going to make up this principle and abide by this principle forever.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.640]   Now I'm not saying we shouldn't be reflective or introspective, or I'm not saying that the
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:57.000]   building of principles is bad, but primarily, wisdom comes from God.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.920]   Wisdom comes from God.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:04.040]   It's not, the application of truth isn't static.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.240]   His mercies are new every morning.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.320]   As we seek him, he will give us wisdom.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.360]   And we never reach a point where we say to ourselves, oh, I have all the wisdom I need.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.960]   James chapter one doesn't apply to me anymore.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:25.440]   No one gets into that category anymore, you know, and so, yeah, Pastor Peter, you know,
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.120]   we're not going to start, you know, this witch hunt discernment ministry.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.760]   We're not going to do that.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:36.640]   Neither are we going to be naive as to think that some people are superhuman.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.240]   All men have, all men of sin all fall short of the glory of God.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:46.120]   And so we kind of live in biblical truth.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.800]   And we seek a person, you know, we seek a person, right?
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:32:04.160]   So, you know, Pastor Peter, I want to ask you, so for a lot of people, they, or, you
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:11.880]   know, some group of people maybe, you know, have his books, you know, they profited from
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   his lectures.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.800]   What will be your advice?
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.760]   Should we burn his books?
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:25.640]   You know, should we not listen to it or what, you know, should we get rid of anything associated
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   with him?
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.600]   I see arguments both ways, but if you can kind of just shed some light on that.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.800]   Yeah, I mean, it's hard to give like a universal advice saying that this is what every person
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.040]   should do.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.400]   But I could, you know, I'll tell you what I would do.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:48.200]   I wouldn't recommend his books because there are many other books that I think could do
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.120]   the job that he's done.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.320]   I personally don't have a problem reading it because I can detach what I'm reading from
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.880]   the person who wrote it.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.040]   You know, there's a lot of good books that people fell away in their faith at the latter
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   part of their life.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.380]   And if we were to go back and discern and to trash everything, you know, there's a lot
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.640]   of books that really wouldn't stand the test of time.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:15.600]   But personally, if you're able to do that, and I know a lot of people that did because
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:22.200]   what he did was so disturbing that they can't detach that as they're reading his stuff.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.800]   And you're perfectly within your rights to say, I'm not going to read it because it bothers
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   me.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.920]   But for whatever reason, I could detach that emotional part with what he said.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.640]   So if I can, if I can be blessed by what he said, right, because what he said isn't his
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.700]   knowledge.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.400]   What he's saying is wisdom ultimately come from God.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:50.040]   So even if a secular, a secular scientist, you know, tells me something about the universe
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:55.000]   and even though he's an adulterer and he's as immoral as you can get, you know, that
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.560]   causes me to see the glory of God, even if it came through the study of that man who
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.300]   hates God, you know.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.040]   So I kind of take it like that.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.200]   I don't think we need to collect all his books and burn it.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.760]   But I would be very cautious and wise in the way that I recommend it to people.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.880]   Yeah, no, that, I mean, that's good.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:22.880]   I mean, you know, Einstein wasn't a Christian, but I think everyone accepts his general theory,
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.920]   his theory of general relativity.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:32.400]   And certainly when you study the theory of general relativity, it expands and, you know,
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:40.360]   puts me in a state of awe at how God created the universe.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:48.720]   You know, Pastor Peter, so I don't want to make this too long, but what would you say
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:54.360]   are things that we can learn from the life of, I mean, you've already alluded to it,
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:00.040]   but you know, if someone, you know, someone's in college, it doesn't have to be college,
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.240]   but you know, someone comes up to you, looked up to Ravi Zacharias, you know, he's, he or
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.200]   she is just completely heartbroken.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.120]   And that makes that person introspective because that person understands it could be any one
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.500]   of us.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.600]   What would you say to that person?
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.960]   You know, it's understandable, you know, but you know, what's interesting to me is when
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:30.440]   Apostle Paul went to Berea, he said that the Bereans were more noble character, noble minded
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.580]   because they questioned him and they tested him by scripture.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.080]   So you would think humanly speaking, it's like, what, why you question me?
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.440]   And then Thessalonians, they said, you know, when I spoke the word, you listen to it as
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.840]   if it was the word of God, which it was.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.600]   But he says that the Bereans were even more noble than them because they were questioned.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:56.320]   And I think going forward, everybody, like nothing should be above the word of God, you
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.520]   know, and I'm not saying that we should have a critical spirit, you know, but we need to
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.280]   be familiar with the word of God enough that when we sense the wolf, right, that you don't
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.080]   have to go and ask, is he a wolf?
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:17.160]   Like know the truth well enough that when something is off, right, that you can test
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.160]   it through the word of God.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.520]   So that's one.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:26.600]   Secondly, the emotional damage that that does, if it's damaging to the point where you don't
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:32.960]   trust anybody, and maybe even God, that's something that we have to take a step back
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.360]   and say, maybe your confidence was placed in the wrong place to begin with.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:43.000]   And God may be using this to reveal to you that your confidence ultimately wasn't God
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.920]   himself, right?
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:52.360]   So when his supposed messenger that you realize is, you know, like what's exposed now and
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:58.920]   that destroys your faith, that means your faith was resting upon man and not God, right?
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.360]   So that's the second thing.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:07.080]   But for those people who are genuinely hurt, their faith is not shaken, but genuinely hurt
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   by that.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.520]   That's natural, right?
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.880]   To go from that to say, I trust no man, that's also a mistake because the Bible says to submit,
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:21.680]   to submit to elders, you know, to respect and honor, and God establishes leaders and
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.520]   elders for a reason, right?
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.400]   But to say, go from that to so therefore I don't ever trust the church, you know, I love
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:33.160]   God but I don't love people, you know, that's also a rebellious heart, right?
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.080]   Because God tells us to love, God tells us to submit, God tells us to honor and build.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:43.620]   But that requires maturity, you know, it's just like when you first started dating somebody
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.080]   or getting married and you have this ideal vision of what you think your wife is going
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:54.440]   to be like, and then inevitably you get out of your honeymoon and you see reality of the
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.600]   selfishness and sinfulness in yourself and in your wife.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.760]   And when the building happens is when you see the reality of who you are, you accept
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:10.040]   them and love them anyway, and you speak truth and love, cover over some sins, and you endure
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:17.000]   with one another, and you love despite the things that you see, and eventually a great
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.480]   marriage is built on true foundation, right?
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.440]   In the same way, like, you know, when we're young we have a tendency to idolize and put
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.000]   people on pedestal, and then when they get knocked off the pedestal, like, you don't
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.440]   want to honor anybody, you don't want to follow anybody, that's also a mistake.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:42.860]   That's just like saying, because you came out of your honeymoon, I want a divorce, right?
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.360]   That's an unhealthy way to deal with the situation.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:54.320]   I think the hurt and pain should lead us to find refuge in Christ, and then love everybody
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.360]   as if you're loving a sinner who's been forgiven.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.200]   No matter who you respect, there are also sinners who've been forgiven.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:08.160]   Then we could build a healthy church, that you don't expect perfection from your leaders.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.040]   You expect mistakes, but you can cover over that, right, and still honor them.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.000]   How do you honor somebody that you know are not perfect?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.380]   That's also part of maturity.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:22.720]   Just like we learn to respect our parents, you know, you go through a rebellion when
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.800]   you start to see imperfections in your teenage years, but eventually you grow up and you
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.920]   see them as human beings, but you learn to honor flawed human beings, and that's what
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.000]   causes you to mature.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.440]   So I think that's the same, in the same way, right, like to not to be discerning, you know,
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:46.040]   question and know the Word of God, but at the same time know that mankind, even if they
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:51.480]   are good men of God, they're flawed, right, and to learn to focus on Christ.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:40:02.640]   Yeah, that's good, Pastor Peter, you know, I mean, I go back to what you said, you know,
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:09.960]   early on in this response, but is that the Word of God is sufficient, and we need to
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:21.280]   know the Word of God, because we can handle things in one swing or a completely different
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:28.920]   swing when the Bible is teaching us to handle it in a completely different aspect than what
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.840]   we're normally inclined to do, whether it's left or right, the Bible's telling us to go
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:40.360]   straight in the middle, you know, and you can't follow what you don't know, and if you
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.560]   don't know the Word of God, then we're lost.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:53.240]   Yeah, I mean, you're in a completely dark room with no light without the Word of God,
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:41:00.800]   and you know, we saw this with CRT, we saw this with just what's going on in the world
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:10.720]   with social justice, we're divided, but the Word of God is not ambiguous, the Word of
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:16.760]   God is clear, and the more we attach ourselves to the Word of God, the clearer this world
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:22.400]   is going to be, so yeah, thank you for that, Pastor Peter, did you want to say something?
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.000]   Yeah, I mean, because you brought up what's going on, I mean, think about where we're
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.640]   at right now.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:35.280]   You have one group of Christians saying that if you don't march with the Black Lives Matter,
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:42.440]   you don't love Jesus, right, and if you don't fight against that, you don't love Jesus.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.120]   If you are a Democrat, you don't love Jesus.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.960]   If you aren't a Republican, you don't love Jesus.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.480]   If you don't wear a mask, you don't love Jesus.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.560]   If you wear a mask, it's because you don't love Jesus.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:01.200]   I mean, you have these voices, right, now, are there some truth to everything that they're
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.400]   saying, of course, there's some truth, right, but we have, especially right now, we're living
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:14.240]   in a generation where people are so convicted, one way or the other, right, and maybe some
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:22.160]   of that is true, maybe some of that is wrong, but we're not going to find truth ourselves,
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.100]   just because, you know, I'm balanced, I'm smarter than those guys, you know, I'm more
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:34.520]   moral, that's not the plumb line that God gave us to be able to see if our life is level,
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:39.060]   you know, the only plumb line that we have to be able to measure if something that seems
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:44.920]   to be right, maybe crooked, is God's Word, so, you know, right now, like, it seems right
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.560]   in every direction, to the left or to the right, to wear the mask, don't wear the mask,
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.640]   get the vaccine, don't get the vaccine, and everybody, and even the so-called professionals,
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.800]   pastors, celebrity pastors, are saying polar opposite things, saying that if you really
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.560]   love Jesus, if you really did, you would do this, right, so, if we don't have the plumb
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:12.120]   line to measure with, you're going to end up doing basically who you like, I like this
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.920]   pastor, so I'm going to trust what he says, you know, I tend to lean this way, so I'm
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:22.320]   going to lean toward that way, which is how bad doctrine and bad life and corruption to
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:28.360]   the church comes in, so if there's any time where we needed to stick to the Word of God,
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:34.800]   it's now, right, because that's the only plumb line that measures if something is not level,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.240]   because we can't, clearly, we can't tell with our own eyes.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   Yeah, yeah, in times of peace, you know, the necessity to be in the Word isn't as apparent
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:59.520]   as it is in times of confusion, in times of confusion, you realize, man, I don't know
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.480]   how to interpret, I don't know what's going on, I don't know who to believe, and it kind
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:11.000]   of reveals, maybe we had more trust in men than we ought to have, you know, and the thing
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.480]   is, even if you land on the correct position, whatever that might be, if you don't take
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:23.760]   the proper vehicle there, you know, it doesn't really mean much, because you still have faith
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   in men, you just happen to be fortunate, you know, and that doesn't really do anyone much
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:40.560]   good, so the primacy of every believer being in the Word of God is so apparent now and
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:49.120]   so central, you know, yeah, yeah, so, you know, we can talk more, we can talk about
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.200]   James Coates, we can talk about so many other things, but I'm looking at the time here,
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.480]   and it's already 42 minutes, so we'll end here, Pastor Peter, do you want to pray for
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   us?
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   Sure.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you for this ministry, and we pray, Father, that
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:16.780]   our discussion would just help us to gain wisdom, whatever that was said that may cause
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:23.920]   confusion, I pray, Lord, that you would help to filter that out for the listeners, and
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:28.800]   even in the things that we've said, I pray, Father God, that our listeners would listen
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:34.520]   with a lens of your Word, and help us truly be Bereans, Lord God, who test all things
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.720]   according to what you have said, that Christ would be at the center, Christ would be the
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:44.200]   head of our church, and I thank you, Father, for Elder James, and I pray that you would
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:49.840]   bless this ministry, and just asking, Lord God, that you would give him wisdom, and that
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.560]   this ministry would flourish, Lord God, that we may be blessed as a church as well.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:00.840]   I pray for the believers, Lord, who have been deeply affected by Rav Zechariah's sin, Lord,
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:05.080]   we don't know where he will be in eternity, but we know, Lord God, that you are gracious
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:10.280]   and loving, I pray for those who have been affected, whether it is in our church or all
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.640]   around the world, that this would not be a reason, Lord God, to abandon their faith,
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:21.200]   but only to strengthen it further, and not to put their confidence in men, but in you,
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:27.080]   in your Word alone, so we pray, Father God, that true fruit, genuine fruit, pruning, Lord
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:32.800]   God, would come out of this situation, ultimately for the greater good of your glory, in Jesus'
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.520]   name we pray, amen.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.120]   As Pastor Peter has just prayed, our hope is that this would bring clarity, and not
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.680]   more confusion, but in the case anything we said does raise another question, well, you
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.800]   know where we go to church.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:58.480]   Thanks for making it to the end, I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.360]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
