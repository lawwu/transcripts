[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   As a parent, you know it's not just baby talk.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Somebody's hungry.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   So talk with your baby's doctor about invasive pneumococcal disease, or IPD,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   and ask how Prevnar 20 pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine can help protect them.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Children under 2 are at increased risk,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   but Prevnar 20 can help them develop more immunity to 20 strains of bacteria that cause IPD.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Prevnar 20 is approved for children 6 weeks and older
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   to help prevent infections from 20 strains of bacteria that cause invasive pneumococcal disease.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Do not get Prevnar 20 if your child has had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or its ingredients.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Those with weakened immune systems may have a lower response to the vaccine.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Talk to your health care provider before vaccination if your baby was born prematurely.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Side effects may include irritability, pain, redness, swelling at the injection site,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   drowsiness, muscle pain, decreased appetite, headache, and fever.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   For full prescribing information, please call 1-855-213-2138 or visit Prevnar20.com.

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   My guest today is Joe Fairless. Joe, do you think you can fulfill that tagline
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   and give some ideas and tips and tactics and tools from your own experience
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   to help my audience along that road?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's a tall task, but yeah, let's get rocking.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Well, your website presents you as being a master of these, so we'll do the best we can.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   What's your story?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Well, what's my story? I am from Texas.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I majored in advertising at Texas Tech University.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Graduated in 2005, moved up to New York City.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Right afterwards, worked on Madison Avenue at advertising agencies.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And I went from being a junior project manager
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   all the way to the youngest VP of a New York City advertising agency.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   When I was a junior project manager, my check every two weeks was about $750.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   My rent was $775, so as you can imagine, I was financially strapped living in New York City.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   As I grew, financially and within the companies, the advertising agencies,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I maintained my same level of expenses.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   My rent at most was $1,100, and my paycheck went from $30,000 to $150,000.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So what I did by keeping my expenses fixed for the most part,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   is I was investing on the side.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And my friends would make fun of me.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   They'd be like, "Dude, you're living like a college kid.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   You're eight, nine years removed from college,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and you got a dorm-style refrigerator,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and you don't even have a living room in your apartment, and you have a roommate."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And I said, "Yep, that's true."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   But I was also an investor on the side.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I was investing in single-family homes while living in New York City.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I was investing in Dallas-Fort Worth.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I ended up having four single-family homes that I bought.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   People were wondering, "How the heck are you doing that?"
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And I said, "Well, let me tell you."
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And I told them how I would invest in single-family homes.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I'll get into that in more detail if you'd like.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And after I invested in some single-family homes,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I realized that I wasn't digging advertising anymore.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It wasn't fulfilled.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I learned how to buy apartments and raise money,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   or buy apartments with investors and share in the profits.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And that was in July of 2013 when I bought my first place.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I left the advertising world, and now I haven't looked back.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And I now control $54 million with the real estate,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   primarily multifamily communities.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Who taught you to take this approach to your investment life?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   A bunch of books, a bunch of authors that don't know me,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   and a bunch of seminars, as well as some consultants.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   So, specifically, some books that I read.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   The first one was "Investing for Dummies."
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It talks about the three different ways of investing,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   stocks, bonds, LLCs, and real estate.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I gravitated towards real estate.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Then I went to more seminars.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I went to a Rich Dad Poor Dad seminar.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I went to a couple other local seminars in New York City,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   where I was living at the time.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I now live in Cincinnati.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I went to a couple of those seminars.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And my sister is a real estate agent in Dallas-Fort Worth.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   My dad used to be a real estate agent.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So, I've grown up around real estate.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It just made more sense to me than stocks and bonds
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   and investing in LLCs.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And then I've brought on some consultants.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Since then, I have a life coach right now
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   through the Tony Robbins program.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And I have a podcast that's the world's longest daily
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   real estate podcast.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And as a result of that, I meet a bunch of people,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   some of them who are in my space.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And I stay in touch with them.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And if I come up with some challenging questions
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   or some issues, I reach out to them and they help me out.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Did your parents encourage you to read about finance?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   No.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   No, they did not.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It wasn't ever really a discussion.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I always had a job.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I had a job whenever I was 15.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I think before I was legally able to have a job,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I was pouring concrete and asphalt at Lockheed
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   in Fort Worth, working for a contractor.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   My buddy's dad, who was a contractor for Lockheed.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And I worked at Discount Tire in high school.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I worked at Office Max.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I had my own lawn mowing business.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Always had a job.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   A party warehouse was another job all in high school.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   But the actual financing part wasn't.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   What I realized is whenever I was making $30,000,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   when I moved to New York City,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and my rent was more than half of one of my pay--
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   more than one of my paychecks,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I realized that I needed to figure out how to budget.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And as I was climbing the corporate ladder,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I was making money.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And I just naturally wanted to just kind of command
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   my own future.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And I just kind of realized that was the thing I needed to do.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   How old are you now, Joe?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   34.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And do you consider yourself to be financially independent,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   meaning you're working because you want to,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   not because you have to?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Yeah, I have four or five different streams of income.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And I'd say two or three of them alone
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   would qualify me for working because I want to
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   and not because I have to.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And if you were going to guess,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   do you remember at what age you kind of woke up,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   looked at your financial statements,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   and realized that, "Hey, I've done this.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I'm financially independent"?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It would be within the last 12 months.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Great.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   We're talking about kind of a time frame of about 13 years,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   something like that, from the time you went through college
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   and moved up to New York City.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It took you a little over a decade, something like that,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   to achieve financial independence?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Yep.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   That's awesome.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Congratulations.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I just point that out because one of the things
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   that I've spent a lot of time on Radical Personal Finance
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   talking about is that there are ways to short-circuit
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   the process of becoming financially independent.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   You don't have to wait until you're 65.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And those ways are simple.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   They're not easy, but they're simple.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And they involve increasing your income.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   In your story, I hear dramatic increases in your income,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   going from $30,000 to $150,000 on Madison Avenue.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   How many years did that take you?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It took me about seven.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Okay.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So there's a significant increase there,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   a lot of hard work.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I'm sure there were a lot of hours,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   a lot of building expertise,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   living on less than you make, in your case substantially less,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and then investing the difference wisely.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And if you do that in a reasonably short period of time,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   a decade or two, you can build financial independence.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Yeah, that's what happened.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   It's exciting, right?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Yeah, I guess at this point,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   it doesn't really register with me, quite frankly.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It's more about what can I continue to do
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   to optimize what I'm doing,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and then what's the exciting project that's coming up next,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   and how can I win that project, and how can I add value.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   So it's funny, I never really thought about it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I've more thought about how can I grow
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   the different businesses that I have,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   and how can I optimize them and scale them.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Why is it important to you to grow your businesses and scale them?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Because if we don't grow, we die.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So if I'm not growing, then I'm stagnant,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   and there's complacency,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and any time you're stagnant, just look at stagnant water.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It just becomes filthy and disgusting.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   So I have to constantly grow,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   and as human beings, we have to constantly grow.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   So I think there's also a component about it
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   that's just a whole lot of fun.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   It's fun to track my podcast downloads
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   from the point when I started the podcast,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   when I was bringing, you know,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I had like 800 downloads,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   to now where I'm over 130,000 downloads a month.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   It's fun to track that stuff,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and see how I can bring on team members,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   and then scale something, and then get the notoriety.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I mean, it's just pretty cool,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   as well as it's fun to play at a higher level in business,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   on the different businesses I have.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   So I have my podcast, which is a business.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   I have a consulting program, which is a business.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I buy apartment communities with investors
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   and share in the profits.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That's my main money maker.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And I have a couple miscellaneous things,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   like online classes and stuff.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But those are the main revenue streams,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   and those are the main businesses,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   launching a conference.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So I just enjoy it.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   It's just a lot of fun for me.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Do you ever get tired?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Yeah, yeah, I get tired.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I don't get tired of what I just described,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   but I get sleepy.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   What I mean is, do you ever just look at all these things
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   and say, "Maybe I should simplify.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Maybe I should pull back.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Maybe I should rest on my laurels
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and enjoy what I've built a little bit more"?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Well, everything in that question
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   is the implication that I'm not enjoying it.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And it's actually the opposite.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I thrive off of it.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I love it.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And the businesses that I just described,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   the common denominator is real estate.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So it's not that I've got a consulting gig
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   where I'm teaching people how to make pancakes.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   The consulting thing is how to buy apartments
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   with investors and share in the profits.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   The podcast is The Best Real Estate Investing Advice Ever.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   My book is The Best Real Estate Investing Advice Ever, Volume 1.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   There's going to be a new volume released every six months.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   The conference is The Best Real Estate Investing Advice Ever conference.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And so they all ladder up to real estate investing.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And I think when we have that focus of what we enjoy,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   then the variety comes into play
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   when we spin off of that focus
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   and see how we can expand with little areas of it.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And those little areas are what I described.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   You mentioned that you began your career on Madison Avenue
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   in an entry-level position and you grew it to a six-figure income.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I don't know how impressive $150,000 is in Madison Avenue terms
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   in New York City prices and wages,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   but it's certainly a dramatic difference from $30,000.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   What did you do to grow your income?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   A couple things.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Let's see.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   When I first started, I was making $30,000.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I was working at an advertising agency, a very prestigious one.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I realized that I didn't want to do what my boss was doing.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I also realized that the next step up was just--
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   it wasn't going to be financially rewarding.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   So I left after nine months.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I left that agency, very prestigious,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   and went to an agency where I was the seventh employee.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   The agency was called Mr. Youth.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Now they're called MROY.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   My first salary there was $38,000.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   From $38,000 when I started,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   and then I got probably five, six, seven promotions,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   somewhere around there.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   When I left, I was making $120,000
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   about five and a half, six years after that.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Our agency also grew from me being the seventh employee
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   to over 100 employees during that time.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   We went from being the company that was on the ground
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   passing out flyers at a spring break event
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   to meeting--I was meeting with the chief marketing officer
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   at Microsoft within being an MSN
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   because we're the social media agency of record.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   So we as an agency, as a company, matured,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and through that process, we grew our company
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   and I elevated within it much faster
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   than what would be typical at a more established agency.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I then used that experience and got a vice president position
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   at another more established agency,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and I said--and I looked at the job description.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   I was someone who had to be in the business for 10 plus years,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   and I'd been in it for six or seven.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   But I told them that their agency reminded me
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   of how we grew and how we expanded our offerings,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   and I can bring that to their company.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Regardless of how much experience I have,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   it's the type of experience that I had.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   It's not a number of years.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It's actually the quality of experience,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and I sold them on that.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I was able to get a job with them for $150,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and I don't think that included the bonus either.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I think there's probably going to be a bonus,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   but I didn't stay there for 12 months.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   I actually left after about nine months again
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   because I realized that that wasn't what I wanted to do,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   and that's whenever I got into my entrepreneurial ventures.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   In the real estate field.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Yeah, well, actually, I should also mention,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   right after I left advertising,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   my focus was going to be to help college students
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and young professionals learn how to get to the level
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I was at as fast as I got there.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   So basically, consult them to rise through the ranks.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   But I launched a website, paid a designer $3,000,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   and I didn't get any clients.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   I mean, it was like crickets.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And so I quickly pivoted, and I was like,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   "Okay, this just isn't working."
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And at the time, I had been teaching a class on the side also
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   on how to buy those homes that I was buying,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   and one of a couple people who I knew pretty well,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   they're like, "You know what?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   "If you ever do something larger, let me know."
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I heard that two or three times.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And when you have clients, before you have a product,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   you know you've got a good business.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Whereas on the consulting thing with advertising,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   where I wanted to consult college students
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   and young professionals, I had a product,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   but I didn't have clients.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And it didn't work out.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   But once I heard from potential clients
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   that they wanted a product, I was like,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   "You know what? Maybe I'll look into this."
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And so I spent six months from January to July of 2013
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   looking for a place, got it under contract,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   and ended up making it happen.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   The reason I'm focusing on your career,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   rather your business, your career in New York
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   versus real estate, is that your career,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   from what you're telling me, served as the foundation
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   for the money to get started in real estate.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   That progression, what were you teaching in your class,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   or what did you intend to teach to college students
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and young professionals to help them rise
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   through the ranks as quickly as you did?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Was there some kind of daily practice?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Did you have some kind of psychological juju
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   that you were working on?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   What did you actually do?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   What were you teaching them tactically?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Well, and we can focus on whatever you want, it's your show,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   so I'll just roll with it. I'm fine with it.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   I want to make it clear.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   So I was teaching a class on how to buy houses
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   in other states while living in New York City.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I was teaching that class while I had my full-time job
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   in advertising.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   I wanted, after I left my full-time job,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   I wanted to have clients to teach them
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   how to climb the corporate ladder in PR and advertising.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I did not get any clients with that business venture,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   and I folded it within a month.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   So I did not teach anybody anything about that,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   with one exception.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I was also interviewing people for a book
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   that I was writing called
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   "Join the Remarkable 75 Tips to Have a Remarkable Career."
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And I interviewed a bunch of people
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   who have had remarkable careers
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   in all the different professions,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   and I also, on the side, was teaching a class on that.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   So I was basically doing a bunch of stuff
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   while I had my full-time job.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I also did improv.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I did stand-up comedy at Gotham Comedy Club in New York City.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I was doing as much as I could
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   except for my full-time job in advertising
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   because I wasn't fulfilled towards the very end of it.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Got it.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Tell me about your first two real estate deals.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   My first two?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Those would be my first two single-family homes.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   The one I bought in 2009 and the other, 2010.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   My first one I put 20% down, typical loan.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I bought it for $76,000.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   20% would be--
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I think all in, I was at $20,000
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   when you factor in the closing costs.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   It rented for, at the time, $1,100.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   It's in Duncanville, Texas, four-bedroom, two-bath house.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I still have it today.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   It was in 2009, so it was a time
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   when things were pretty tough to get loans.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Additionally, it was my first loan,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   so I had to write a letter to the lender
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   telling them why I--
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   and I rented in New York City.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I'd tell them why I was renting in New York City
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   but buying in another state,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   who I would have as property management.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   There was a couple things I had to overcome on that one.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   The second one was a three-bedroom, two-bath house
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   The purchase price was $81,000.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   I got it through a loan program called HomePath,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   which no longer exists.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   But HomePath was pretty cool
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   because it allowed me to only put 10% down.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   So I put $8,100 down on that property
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   plus closing costs, all in about $12,000.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And it rented for, at the time--
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   rents have gone up on both of them since then--
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   but it rented for, at the time, $1,150, I believe.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And it was built in 2006.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   That was the kicker.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   It was pretty darn new.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   No, 2006--somewhere around there.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Early 2000s, somewhere around there.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   So it was very, very nice.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Low to no maintenance.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   And both have been rented with the exception of maybe
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   in total 12 months between both of them since then.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   But with single-family homes, what I've realized--
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   it's easy to talk about the potential profits on them,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   but not a lot of people talk about,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   "Well, when someone moves out,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   "you're going to be paying a good chunk of your money
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   "towards fixing it up and getting someone else to move in."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   For example, I just had a move-out on that second house,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   and all in, it cost me $5,000 to get it to be move-in ready again.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Paint, carpet, trash out, fix the toilet,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   put a couple screws in the wall, whatever you need to do.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And when I'm making $250 on a month,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   and you pay $5,000 on that,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   well, that's what, 250 times 12, that's $3,000.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   So it's going to take you almost two years
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   to recover the loss of when one person moves out.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Not a lot of people tell you that.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   That's been one of the eye-opening experiences
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   that I've learned with single-family homes.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And the way to solve that is a couple.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   One, once the mortgage is gone,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   you're going to be doing really well.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   So one of my homes I have on a 15-year mortgage.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   The other two are on 30 years just for cash flow reasons,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   because I don't think I'd cash flow with a 15-year on the other two.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And then the other is,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I realized I wasn't going to do single-family homes anymore
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   after these, because the amount of time it took me to find one,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   to run the numbers, to get financing approval,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   to coordinate the insurance, get the taxes every year,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   it was just annoying for $250 a month,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   and then to have that erased with a $5,000 move-out fee.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   So now I focus on large apartment buildings.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   So my intention of bringing up those two deals
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   is just simply to describe them with no offense intended.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   They sound like just pretty ordinary deals.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   They sound like you just simply went and bought a house,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   and probably you got a decent deal on it,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   but you went and bought a house.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   But the fact that you had a steady job,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   the ability to get bank financing,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   and the fact that you had a down payment,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   which was saved from your income,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   allowed you to get started and to go ahead and get some properties,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   which you were buying at a good time in the market,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   where they were able to cash flow the mortgage.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And they just sound like pretty ordinary deals.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Is that accurate?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Yeah, totally ordinary.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   The only thing that's not ordinary about them
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   is I bought them at the right time in the right market.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   I was just going to say,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   right time in terms of 2008, 2009,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and also in Texas with Texas real estate prices
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   being substantially depressed at that time especially.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   So you transitioned then to multifamily
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   because of recognizing the shortfall of these individual houses
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   that you were owning?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Yeah, a couple of reasons.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   One, I realized that I had to buy a whole bunch of them
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   to get a substantial amount of money coming in every month.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And it was tough to get one, let alone a bunch of them.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Two, when I left advertising,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   the irony is that I couldn't get approved for a single family home
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   because I didn't have a W-2 income,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   but I could bring in a group of investors
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   and we could buy a multi-million dollar apartment community
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   because they're evaluated differently.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   They're evaluated based on the income the property generates,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   the net worth and liquidity of the buying group,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   and the experience of the buying group.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   So all I had to do was be resourceful
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   and put the pieces in place to do bigger deals.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   And you can and you do, if you're doing it right,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   make more money on the bigger deals than the $250 of pop deals.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Tell me about your first multifamily deal.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   It's 168 units in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   We actually got it through a creative financing method
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   called a master lease with option to purchase.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   The reason why we did that is because there was a,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   about a nine hundred, almost a million dollar deficit
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   or prepayment penalty on the property
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   if the loan was paid off early.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   So we had one of two options.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   We could do an assumption and assume the loan with a 1% fee,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   but the loan was 6.19%
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and to pay that assumption fee to just to assume a loan that's 6.19%
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   because they got the loan in, I think, like 2009-ish.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   So their rates were pretty high.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   It just didn't make sense.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   The other was to do something creative called a master lease
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   with option to purchase.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Other states, it could be known as a land contract.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   We were able to take control of the property
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   and then we were responsible for all the expenses,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   including the mortgage payment, insurance, and taxes,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   but we also get to keep all the income.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   The kicker that made it most appealing to us
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   was that while we had the master lease,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   we would get credit on the principal pay down of the mortgage.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So every month that we make the mortgage payment,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   we decrease the principal balance by roughly $15,000.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   So the longer you hold on to it, the more equity that you build
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   as a result of just paying down the mortgage,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   and we agreed to the price of $6.35 million
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   for the purchase that we'd eventually buy it at
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   in three and a half years at the time--or four years, actually.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   So we were agreeing--basically, from taking a step back,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   we were agreeing to purchase the property
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   for today's value in four years from that day,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and over those four years,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   we'd get credit for the principal pay down on the mortgage,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   which would help us build equity,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   even if we didn't increase the value of the property.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And what was your contribution to the deal?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Putting it together.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   For the first deal, I didn't put any of my own money in it
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   because I didn't have any of my own money to put in the deal.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   I raised over--I raised about $1.1 million.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   $843,000 came from a total of 12 investors that I brought in,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   and then the difference of $1.1 and $843 came from
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   the brokers who were representing the buyer.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   They put in their commission into the deal
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   as a form of down payment
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   so that we could get to the down payment mark,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   and they became 25% owners with us in the deal.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And then there were some prorated deposits and taxes
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   that we got credit for, and all in it was around $1.3.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   So this sounds like a neat deal,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and it demonstrates that using what you--
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   using the resources that you had--
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   you didn't have the money, but you had the time, the skill,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   the network--use those resources to put together the deal that--
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   has it paid off financially for you at this point?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   I mean, at closing, I got a check for $22,000
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   to put the deal together.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   It's what's called an acquisition fee.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And just to take a step back to get into some numbers,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   because I know you like numbers,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and your audience likes numbers,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   how I make money on multi-family--
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   what is called multi-family syndication--
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   how I make money is three ways.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   One is an acquisition fee,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   which is usually 2% of the purchase price.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   In this case, it was not.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   It's less than 1%, probably less than one-half of a percent,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   but that was my first deal.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Now, for every other deal, it's 2% of the purchase price.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   The second way is 2% of the income
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   that's collected every month.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   That's an asset management fee--
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   the fee to oversee the numbers,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   oversee the property management company,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   oversee the business plan.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And then there's equity ownership that you have in the deal,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and that's the big one,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   where you get equity ownership in the deal
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   because you put the deal together.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   And that can be anywhere from an 80--
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   you can get 20% for putting in 5% of the deal,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   so basically you're getting 15% putting the deal together.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   It can be any number of combinations.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   You're only limited by your investors
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   and your creativity for how you put it together
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   that meets your investors' goals.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   But going back to the first deal,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   yeah, I got a check at closing for $22,000.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Now, I also learned a bunch of lessons on that deal--
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   a bunch of hard lessons.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   And I have not, nor will I ever, repeat those mistakes again.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   A couple lessons--
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   one is--this is so stupid,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   but if I did it, maybe someone else will do it--
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   or no, they won't do it after they listen to your podcast,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   but maybe someone else might have done it.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And that is, I raised enough money for the down payment,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   but I was so stupid that I didn't raise money
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   for operating budget or capital improvements.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And capital improvements are basically parking lot,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   you know, fix a pool,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   just do certain things around the property,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   fix AC units that need to be done.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   That was a mistake.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   And what I've had to do since we've closed
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   is put in my own money to cover that.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   And we're actually about to close on the property
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   in two or three days from now.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And the investors will make a pretty darn good return on it.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And I've had investors invest in other deals
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   who are in that deal.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   But that was one lesson I've personally learned.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Another lesson that I learned the hard way
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   is I learned the difference between economic and physical occupancy.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   At the time, I would ask, "What's your occupancy?"
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And they said, "98%."
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And you know what, we could make it 100% if you wanted.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   I mean, we're just rocking it.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   I'm like, "That's amazing. That sounds great."
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   But the question I should have asked is,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   "What's your economic occupancy?"
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And the difference between occupancy and economic occupancy
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   is that occupancy is people who are on the rent roll,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   people who are living there.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Economic is people who are living there and paying you rent.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   (laughs)
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   So, it turns out that the property had a physical occupancy of 98%,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   but an economic occupancy of 80%.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Big old difference.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Just stupid rookie mistakes that I made.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   I will never make them again.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Not those mistakes. I'm sure I'll make different ones.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   I'll never make those mistakes again.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And now I've also evolved my business
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   to recognize and to compensate
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   for what my strengths and weaknesses are
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   as a person, as an entrepreneur.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   I brought on a business partner,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   and he has a background in underwriting,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   multifamily analysis.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   The time when I was working in advertising agencies,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   he was working at large multifamily companies
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   that were doing what we do for a living.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And he has the traditional background,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   and he's good at running the numbers,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   doing the asset management,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and getting the debt financing,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   so the lender financing.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   What I'm really good at is getting the equity,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   so the down payment from investors,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   as well as marketing and investor communication.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And so that's what we do.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   That's how we structure our business.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   He's focused on his stuff, and I'm focused on my stuff.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And that has taken us to another level,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   because we're able to put our heads down.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He doesn't like raising money.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I enjoy it.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   I like building the friendships.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And we've gone from, you know,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I bought my first place 168 unit in July 2013.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I waited two long years to buy the second one,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   but I bought the second one with my business partner, Frank,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   and it was a 250 unit in Houston.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Then we bought a 155 unit in Houston.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Then we bought a 320 unit in Carrollton, Texas,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   really nice area in Dallas, north of Dallas.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   We are closing on a 296 unit in a month,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   and we just put another 217 unit under contract in Dallas.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   So the business within the last 14 months
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   has just gone bananas.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   That's why you asked financially free.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Well, it's happened in the last 12 to 14 months,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   because of the key of me identifying
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   what I'm not so good at and what I'm really good at
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   and focusing what I'm really good at.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   How did the relationship with your business partner develop?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Through my consulting program, I have a client,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and I encouraged him to start a meetup in Los Angeles,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   because that's where he lives.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   He started a meetup, and he met Frank,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   and then he introduced me to Frank,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   because they needed to close on this 250 unit in Houston.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   They saw the good deal, but they didn't have the money.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   They didn't have the investor network,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and I said, "I do have the investor network.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   I will partner," and that's how we got the first deal done.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   What did you do to develop the investor network,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   which you now have?
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I spent time on earth.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   That's really what it boils down to.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   I try to help people out,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   and I just live a good life.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Let's go back to the 12 people who invested in my original deal,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   because that will give you some specifics.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Let's see.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I'm on the alumni advisory board at Texas Tech.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I had two investors from that,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   and I joined the alumni advisory board at Texas Tech
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   years and years before I was in real estate.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   I just joined it so I could help out young professionals,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   and I went to Lubbock, Texas every year for the conference.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Let's see.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   I had three of them invest in my deal.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   I have a friend who only knows me from my flag football team
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   that I had in New York City where I was a captain,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   and he invested $25,000.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   A roommate from college,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   and actually two roommates from college,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   and then a roommate that I was living with in New York City invested.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   It was a bunch of different networks,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   and one recommendation if any listener is looking for how to raise money
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   or how to think about it for maybe it's their business
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   that they want to raise funding for or whatever,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   doesn't have to be real estate related,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   I recommend that you put in the spreadsheet the first name,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   last name, those would be columns, and then network.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   That's another column,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and then write down how you know that person.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   The goal is once you list out 50 people,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   the goal is to take a look at the different networks that you're a part of
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   and get one person from each of those networks,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   ideally an influential person,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   but at least one person from each of those networks to show interest.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Then you can name check that person with other people within the network.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   I found that firsthand that worked on my first deal
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   because one of my investors, he's like,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   "Oh, well if Brandon's investing, I know he's really smart with his money,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   so sure, I'll take a look at it."
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   That person who said, "I'll take a look at it,"
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   ended up being my biggest investor in my first deal.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   What do you mean by name check?
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Brandon says, "Okay, I'm interested," and you take that to Brian,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   and Brian says, "Okay, if Brandon's interested, then I'm interested?"
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Yeah, as long as you get approval from the initial person.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   You're trying to find somebody with some credentials,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   somebody with maybe some experience who's looked at the numbers and says,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   "Okay, I can see this working, Joe. If you get enough other partners, I'm in."
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Exactly.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Right.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Joe, if I wipe you out, you just went through bankruptcy,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   and I wipe out your investor network,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   wipe out all your relationships for whatever reason,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   and you got to start fresh.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   You're 34 years old, you got a thousand bucks in your bank,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   and you're going to try to start again and rebuild.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   What would you do today, 2016,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   to get started rebuilding what you've built so far?
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   I'd start a daily podcast.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Really simple.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   I'd interview successful people in real estate.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Since my first one was wiped off the face of the earth,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   I guess it would be Best Real Estate Investing Advice Ever, Part 2.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   (laughter)
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Dot, dot, dot.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Hope this one stays.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I'd do the same thing I'm doing.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   I would do a daily interview with a real estate professional.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   I would build credentials.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   The beauty of it, as you know,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   when you interview people on a podcast,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   they share it out with their network,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   you're getting exposed to a brand new group of people
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   who are learning about you,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   as well as learning the person's story, who you're interviewing.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Once I have that daily podcast seasoned,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   so about six months or so,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   then I'd start looking at sponsors.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   That would allow me to delegate out the editing
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   and finding the guests,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   because I'd be able to pay people to do that for me.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   That would free me up to just do the interviews,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   and then I'd be able to focus on other revenue streams.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   That would always be the foundation for my business.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   What else would you do?
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   As far as going out and looking at property,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   you don't have any money,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   but you want to actually build a real estate business.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Would you try to go and bird dog single family houses?
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   No.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   I would start a meetup.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   I'm in Cincinnati.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   By the way, the first thing I did when I moved to Cincinnati last year
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   was I started a monthly meetup,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   and we've met every month for the last 12 or so months.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   I would start a meetup here in Cincinnati.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I would identify a commercial real estate investor
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   who is already making things happen,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   and then I would volunteer my time for him or her.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I would learn from him or her.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   I would do whatever they needed me to do,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   and then I would eventually do what they are doing,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   either with them or outside of them
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   after I've been able to stand on my own two feet
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   and got the connections and learned the process.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   And specifically what that is, don't know.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Depends on the person,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   because whatever is working for them would work for me.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   I just have to follow the process.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   I mean, you can make money in any type of real estate.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   You can make money in any type of business, right?
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   It's because people have, and so it's possible.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   And the path of least resistance, if I were to start over,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   would be to simply find someone locally who I have rapport with,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   who I can help out through just grunt work,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and then get in good with them,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   spend six months, a year, two years, whatever it takes
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   to add value to their life,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   and then just build up my business
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   as a result of latching on to their success
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   and going from there.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Why did you choose Cincinnati to live in?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Two reasons.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I'll list them in order of importance.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   My girlfriend and future fiance lives here and is from here.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   That's number one.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   I met her whenever I was visiting my property in Cincinnati.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   I was living in New York,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   but I was visiting my property in Cincinnati.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   I met her here, and that's number one.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Number two is there's a lot of good real estate opportunities.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   But I suspect that if Colleen, my girlfriend,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   who I love with my life, did not live here,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   if I did not meet her,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   then I don't think I would be living here.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   But I'm glad I'm here, for the record.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Indeed.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   What is the best investment that you have made thus far in your life?
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Oh, I'd say,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   I would say the Internet,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   because that allowed me to watch YouTube videos.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   And through the YouTube videos,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   I discovered Tony Robbins' TED Talk.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   And from Tony Robbins' TED Talk,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   I went to his website,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   signed up for a free coaching session,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   then got a business coach when I first started as an entrepreneur.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   He told me about Entrepreneur on Fire,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   which I'm sure you know, John Lee Dumas,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   a very successful podcaster.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Podcasting wasn't on my radar,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   but my business coach, who I met through Tony Robbins' program,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   he's like, "You should look into doing something like that."
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   I did look into it, then I did it.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   And the podcast has been a game changer for me,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   for my business.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And without that, without the Internet,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   without paying Time Warner,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   even though I'm not a fan of Time Warner,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   without paying Time Warner, none of that would have been possible.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   How important has your 401(k) and your mutual funds
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   been to your overall wealth and business success?
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Well, by cashing them out whenever I didn't have any money,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   they helped me survive and get my first deal done.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   So, they were important.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   I don't recommend that, but that's what I did,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   because I was running out of money
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and basically ran out of money and I needed to survive.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Cobra insurance was incredibly expensive.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   I don't have that anymore, but it was like $800 a month.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   I mean, something ridiculous, plus my rent,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   and I didn't have money coming in besides $250 from each house that I had.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   So, they helped me, but I don't have them now.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   So, there you go.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   It's a trick question,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   because that story is probably the dominant one that I hear
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   in terms of business people.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   It seems rare for me to meet a business person
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   who didn't do that or get very close to using their 401(k)s
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   to invest in their actual business
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   instead of just leaving them aside for the future.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Oh, that's funny. I didn't know that.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   I thought I was the only one.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   It was a trick question. I didn't prep you for it.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   If you're going to give any final advice,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   something I haven't talked about,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   to encourage somebody else who is looking at things
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   and saying, "I'd really love to build something more,"
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   any tips or advice that you'd love to share with somebody
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   or you'd love to have had shared with you
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   when you were back at the beginning stages of your wealth building journey?
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   If you want to build something more,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   then don't think about it and just do it.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Just build it.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Take consistent daily action. That's the main thing.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   No one in the world, in the entire world,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   has done a daily real estate podcast
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   as long as I have.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And by simply being just doggedly focused
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   on putting out an episode every day,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   there has become a tipping point.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   A tipping point has happened with my business.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And that's the foundation.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   So if you want to create something, then great.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Just spend time every single day
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   doing something towards creating it.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   That's it.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   There's a lot of advice.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   I'm sure I could say something much more poetic,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   which is if we stop thinking about it
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   and just take steps every single day
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   towards what it is we want,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   we might not get exactly what we want,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   but I suspect that we will get something better
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   than where we're at right now.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Joe, thanks for coming on.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Share with us your website,
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   any follow-up action steps that you'd love for my audience to take
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   on your projects and your resources.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   The money-raising spreadsheet that I described,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   I actually have a template.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   My assistant, Samantha, would be happy to send that to you
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   if you email info@joefferless.com.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   That's info@joefferless.com.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   And that's that spreadsheet where you list out the name,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   the network, how much you're going to invest.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   There's a couple of other things that I have in there.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   If you're raising money or want to raise money for real estate
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   or for your business, small business,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   this spreadsheet would be helpful.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Info@joefferless.com.
