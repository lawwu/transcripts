[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   [Choral singing]
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   [Choral singing]

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   [Church organ music]
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I am tempted to say that
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   while I agree that things are
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   very bad and the times are difficult
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   that they are not quite as bad as that
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I am referring to the singing.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I am referring to the singing.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Now let me try to
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   help you to understand
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   this situation in which
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   we do find ourselves
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and which led me to choose
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   that particular hymn.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It's a hymn that expresses
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   the problem and the difficulty
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   but there is one to whom we can
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   pray and therefore
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   we are not without hope and we are not
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   cast down but we
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   must be alive and alert
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   we must quit ourselves as men
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and we must
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   in particular as I am
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   going to try to show you use our
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   understanding.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Now then I am reading once more
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   these verses which
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   we have been examining for a number of
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Friday evenings in Paul's
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   epistle to the Romans chapter 11
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   let me read again from
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   verse 18 to the end of verse 22
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   "Burst not
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   thyself because
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   or against the branches
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   but if thou burst
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   thou bearest not the root
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   but the root thee
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   thou wilt say then the branches
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   were broken off that I might be graft
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   in well because
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   of unbelief they were broken
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   off and thou standest
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   by faith
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   be not high minded but fear
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   for if God spared not
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   the natural branches take heed
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   lest he also spare not thee
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   behold therefore
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   the goodness and severity of God
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   on them which
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   fell severity
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   but goodness
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   but toward thee goodness
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   if thou continue
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   in his goodness
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   otherwise thou also
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   shalt be cut off
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Now I've divided
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   this statement which really begins
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   at verse
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   16 under
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   four main headings
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   we've already dealt with three of them we've expanded
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   it explained the meaning of the terms
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and so on we've
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   also dealt with
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   what is the specific teaching
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   conveyed here and
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   in turn in the third place
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   we dealt with a problem that
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   arises in the minds of Christian
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   people as they read
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   this particular teaching the problem
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   which we dealt with last
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Friday night of how to reconcile
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   what this passage seems to be saying
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   on the surface with
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   other statements already made by the
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   great apostle in this epistle
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and in other places and other
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   teachings in the New Testament
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   very well we come now to the fourth division
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   which I've described as general
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   application of all this
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   to us to ourselves
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and to our present
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   situation now
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   as we come to deal with this
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   there are one or two preliminary remarks
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   that I'm anxious to make
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and feel constrained to make
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   the first is
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   that this which we are now about to do
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   is something which we should always do
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   in other words
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   we should always apply
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   the truth
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   the Bible and its teaching
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   are never to be approached
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   in a detached or in a theoretical
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   manner
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   now that is of course the besetting sin
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   of expositors
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   it is still more the besetting sin
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   of historians
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   the danger always
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   is to take a mechanical interest
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and to forget application
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   you'll find this
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   in many expositors
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   they are interested in the words
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and meanings and shades of meanings
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   and arguments and disputations
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   and they tend to leave it at that
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I know there is a case which can be made
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   for the expositor as such
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   that that is all that he is called upon
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   to do and we don't
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   look to him so much for application
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   but it is a danger
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and one can become so involved
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   in the mere mechanics
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   that one entirely
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   forgets and misses
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   the object and the purpose
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   of the whole statement
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and exactly the same is true about historians
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I've often noticed this
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   it's a very interesting thing
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and a very peculiar thing
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   and a thing against which we should all
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   guard ourselves
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I've noticed throughout the years
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   that speaking generally
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   historians
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   seem to have a strange
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   capacity
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   or propensity almost
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   of being entirely
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   uninfluenced by the very history
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   about which they write
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and to which they give their lives
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   in study. I mean by that I've known
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   many men and some of them I've known
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   very well indeed who have been particularly
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   interested in the 18th century
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   but I know some of these men
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and I can say about them quite truthfully
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   that I've never known men
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   who are further removed
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   from the fathers of the 18th century
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   in whom they're so interested
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   it's purely a kind of antiquarian interest
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   now that's a terrible thing
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   it seems to me
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   that we should approach truth
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   either in the form of didactic teaching
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   or in the form of history
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   or any other form
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   without realizing that it is meant
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   to speak to us, to do something for us
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   there is nothing
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   against which we should guard ourselves
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   so much as a mere detached
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   academic and theoretical
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   interest
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   it should always be a living
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   interest
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and that is why it is
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   especially the part of the preacher
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   always to be
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   applying the truth
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I've never called myself a bible lecturer
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   for that reason
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   the bible is to be preached
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   it's always to be applied
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   now
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   the apostle you see here
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   makes us say this very thing
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   he
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   as I've been showing you
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   is dealing primarily with
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   an actual fact of history
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   which had taken place
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   that the Jews had rejected the gospel
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and are outside the church
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and outside the kingdom
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   whereas the gentiles have come in
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   now that's a pure fact of history
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   but the apostle you see
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   can't merely handle this as a fact of history
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   he's concerned with the meaning of this
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   with the relevance of this
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   what this has got to say
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   to the church, to the gentile Christians
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   who are in the church
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   he applies the very fact of history
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   which he is
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   reminding these people of
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and that is the thing I say which we must
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   always be careful to do
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   there's a great deal of history
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   in the bible
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   but the history that is in the bible
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   is not only history
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   that's the important point
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   why not?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   why is it that the history of the bible
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   must never be regarded merely as history
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   the answer is
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   that the bible
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   history is merely
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   illustrative
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   of great spiritual principles
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   and that is undoubtedly
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   why it has been given to us
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   the business of the history
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   is to
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   illustrate the great
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   teaching, the great fundamental
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   and eternal principles
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   of God's plan and purpose
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   of salvation
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   it's not meant to be something in and of itself
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   which you can therefore either take or leave
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   now there are many people who do this
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   there are many Christian people
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   who ignore the historical portions of the bible
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   and they don't see much value in it
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   it's still worse when you get a Christian
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   who dismisses the whole of the old testament
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and feels that it's no longer relevant to him
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   now it's that very tendency
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I'm warning you against
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   and trying to safeguard you
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   against falling into it
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   we must remember therefore that
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   history in the bible
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   is simply one of the ways
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   in which the
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   great principles are taught
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   that's one
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   great lesson
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   but here's another
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   we must pay attention to the history
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   in the bible because these principles
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   which are taught
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   partly through history
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   are always permanent
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and eternal principles
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   that is why you see
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   the bible never dates
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   that's why it's never out of date
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   or putting it the other way around
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   that is why the bible
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   is always contemporary
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   now you can read here
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   of what God did with the children of Israel
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   thousands of years ago
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   but the fact that it happened so long ago
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   doesn't mean that it's got nothing to say
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   to us, it has for this reason
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   that it's the same God
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   who dealt with them as who deals with us
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   and he doesn't change
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   so the principles
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   which are taught in the history of things which happened
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   so long ago
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   are as applicable and as relevant
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   and as true tonight
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   as they have ever been
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   very well then I say that
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   we must always remember that past history
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and examples
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   of what has happened to nations
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   or to individuals
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   that these are but illustrations
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   of these
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   great eternal truths
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and principles that God is always
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   teaching his people
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   so that then
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   becomes the way in which we should
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   always read the bible
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   when you come to it you don't say
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   oh well in the old testament of course
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I've got the history of the Jews
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   well if one happens to be interested in
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   history or interested in the Jews
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   it's profitable to read the history of the Jews
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   as you read the history of the
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Romans or as you read secular history
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   if you happen to have that sort of mind
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   well it's quite an interesting and an entertaining
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   thing to do, to read history
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   now that's the way in which you must
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   never approach the bible
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   or in the new testament
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   you may feel and people often
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   have felt and have said this
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   they say I can't understand
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   why we have all this in the gospels
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   about the wrangling
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   that took place between the Pharisees
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   and our Lord, what's that got to do
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   with us, these miserable wretched Pharisees
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and scribes and
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Sadducees and doctors of the law
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   were always coming along and putting their questions
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and so on, what's all that got to do with me
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   now this you see is quite a common attitude
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   people say what we want is the positive
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   teaching of Jesus and they wished
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   we hadn't got all this historical
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   addition
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   which while it was quite true and it took
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   place, of course has got nothing to do with us
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   because it happened nearly two thousand
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   years ago
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   and that it's all therefore merely of some
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   purely academic, historical
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   or even antiquarian interest
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   now that I say
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   is an attitude which
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   we must avoid at all costs
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   and it all applies to this
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   passage that is before us
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   you may say why are you taking all this time
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   over this, it was an immediate problem
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   then of course, here were the Jews
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   and here were the Gentiles, the whole thing was new
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   it was a live issue, what's it got to do
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   with us, why spend all this time
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   in 1965
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   on something that was very relevant
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   nineteen hundred years ago but surely
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   is of no interest today, now I want to
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   show you how terribly wrong that is
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   in other words
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   we read the Bible like this
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   when you read about the history
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   of the Jews
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   in the Old Testament
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   you should always read it in this way
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   you should say I am the Jews
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   when you read about the
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Pharisees and Scribes, you don't read it
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   as if you're reading a book of history
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   you say but I am the Pharisees and the Scribes
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   this is speaking to me, what our Lord
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   said to them, he's speaking to me
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   now that's the only profitable
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   way in which you read the Bible
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   if you once detach yourself
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and just regard it as purely
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   academic, theoretical, external history
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   you're missing the whole point
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   you're turning the Bible
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   into a textbook of history
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   or into the account of some ancient philosophy
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   and teaching
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   out of which you can pick things up if you like
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   now and again and try to apply them as best you can
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   but it's all wrong
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   this is always contemporary
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   because God remains
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   the same and men remains
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   the same and the relationships
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   between God and men remain the same
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   so the principles
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   taught in terms of this
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   old history are as
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   relevant and as live and as up
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   to date tonight
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   as they have ever been
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   now the scripture itself
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   puts that in these words
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   these things were written
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   for our examples
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   upon whom the ends
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   of the world have come
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I think if I remember rightly
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   I read that very statement to you
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   last Friday night
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and it is a most important
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   one which we must never
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   forget, it's in 1 Corinthians
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   10
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   1 Corinthians 10-11
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   now all these things happened unto them
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   for examples and they are
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   written for our admonition
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   upon whom the ends
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   of the world are come
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   very well
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   that is by way of introduction
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   to the application
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   of this extraordinary statement
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   which the apostle makes here
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   to the Gentiles of his day and generation
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   the application of all that
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   to us at this present time
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   what is it?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   well I'd like to approach
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   it like this, first of all
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   let us look at the general
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   principles which are laid down
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   with respect to
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   our situation today
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   there are certain general
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   principles taught very clearly
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   here is the first
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   there
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   seems to be always
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   a tendency
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   in the church
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   or if you like in God's people
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   in the olive tree
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   there always seems to be a tendency
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   to decline
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   and to
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   fall away from the
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   truth
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   this of course is because we are not yet
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   perfect
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   because sanctification is a process
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and because
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   we are dull and slow of
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   hearing. The great
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   principle that stands out here is
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   that obviously there is
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   this tendency in God's
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   people to fall away
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   from the truth
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I'll show you the great illustrations
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   of this in history in a moment
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   but here it is of course on the surface in the
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   case of the Jews
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   now I want to quote a sentence
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   to you which I remember reading it must
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   be over thirty years ago and it's
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I'm quoting the man who was
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   about as far removed from being an
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   evangelical Christian as a man could be but he was
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   a great thinker and an acute
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   observer, the late Dean Hing
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   he produced a little book on
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Protestantism, it was one of a series
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I'll never forget the first sentence
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   in that book, it was so true
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   he put it all in one phrase
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   he said "every institution
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   tends to produce its opposite"
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   now that's a
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   very profound remark, it's
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   a very perfect summary
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   of the very thing I'm trying
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   to say here, every institution
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   tends to produce its opposite
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   now he was writing on Protestantism
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   and what he was able to show
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   so cleverly in which I want to
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   repeat tonight is this, that by today
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Protestantism has become almost
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   the exact opposite of what it was
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   at its beginning in the 16th century
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   that's what he meant
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   now this is the trouble, why does it arise?
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   well it arises for this reason
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   and I know of no more
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   fascinating subject than this
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   apart from anything else
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   for the mind and for our understandings
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   one of the greatest
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   fights and struggles
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   that ever goes on
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   is the struggle between
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   the spirit and the form
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   the spirit and the form
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   now the spirit must
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   have a form, that's why
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   you have such a thing as the Christian church
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   an idea must always take
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   form, if it is to be of any
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   value, now that's quite right
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   you must have a form to the spirit
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   but, there is always a tension
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   between these two
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   there are always certain dangers
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   that arise
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   and the biggest danger of all
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   is that the form
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   tends to cripple
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   the spirit
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   oh what a
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   what a fight there has been
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I don't think you can begin to understand
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   church history, you can't understand
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   the bible, unless you've
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   got clear in your mind this struggle
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and tension between form and spirit
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   you see
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   what happens is this
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   you've got to have, I say, a form
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   in other words, there must be a minimum
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   of organization, otherwise you can't do anything
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   you can be a vague dreamer
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   but you won't influence, you won't
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   help anybody, every
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   idea has got to take form in some
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   sense or other, but the moment
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   you give it a form, you've got
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   an organization, you've started on your
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   great problem, and the problem is
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   how to prevent the organization
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   from throttling
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   and killing the spirit
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   that's the problem
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   or if you like it
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   in terms of the spirit and
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   institutionalism
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   you remember that great phrase
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   in the book of Ezekiel at the beginning about
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   the spirit in the wheels
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I'll never forget being in America
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   in 1937 at the
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   and a man gave an
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   address and he was going
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   to tell us about some marvelous movement
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   of the spirit
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   which he said had been taking place
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and he took as his text this term
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   the spirit in the wheels
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   and one was expecting something
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   tremendous, but I'm not exaggerating
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   neither am I caricaturing what the
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   man said, but what it really came
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   to was this, he evidently had
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   some idea, but all we were told
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   about was how they'd taken
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   an office, and what they'd
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   paid for the furniture in the office
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   nothing but sheer
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   organization, in other words it was all wheels
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   and no spirit, and there was no movement
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and nothing had happened, and nothing has
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   ever happened since in connection with what he was telling
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   us about, now that's the danger
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   the wheel and the spirit
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   you work that out, preachers I give you
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   that as a text
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   work that out, the spirit, the relationship
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   between the spirit and the wheels
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   you must have the wheels
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   but God forbid that the wheels
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   should put an end to the spirit
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   now this is the thing
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   that is so clear, the whole story
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   of the children of Israel illustrates this
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   this hardening
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   this institutionalizing
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   this
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   organization
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   which ultimately destroys the spirit
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   altogether, now it's a very
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   subtle process this
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   and it is sometimes a very slow
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   one, but the fact that
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   it is slow doesn't mean that it doesn't take
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   place, but it's subtle and slow
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   it's almost imperceptible
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   you can't see it happening
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   and that is why
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   the tragedy takes place so often in the history
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   of the church, people only wake
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   up to the fact that it has happened when it's
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   too late to do anything about it
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   of course this happens in secular history as well
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   it happened in Germany just before
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   the last war, there were many good things about
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Hitler, and that's why many
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Christian people were entirely
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   persuaded by him
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   and they only realized what he was when it was too late
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   the thing is subtle, it's insinuating
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   now perhaps one of the clearest
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   illustrations of all of this
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   is the way in which
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   the so-called higher critical movement
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   came in in the last century
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   you see here's the church
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   she was orthodox, perhaps not as
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   alive as she should be, but at any rate she was fairly
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   orthodox up until about
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   1830
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   but this teaching gradually came in
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   from Germany, and it began to insinuate
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   in various colleges
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and so on in this country, well people
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   began to say, well what's this
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   that's happening, then they said, but it's alright
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   instead of recognizing it at once
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   and dealing with it, they said, oh it'll
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   work itself off, this is just young people
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   and you know they tend to do those sort of things
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   when they get older they'll shake it off, and so on
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   well, it went on and on
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   like that, there was nothing big
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   nothing great, nothing obvious
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   but by today of course
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   it's become predominating and controlling
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   and the truth is having to fight
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   for its life, that's the
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   sort of thing to which I am referring
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   all this tendency
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   of the false and that
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   which cripples the spirit to come in
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   in a very subtle
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   and often in a slow and
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   imperceptible manner, now our Lord himself of course
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   has used this illustration
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   he has compared it to the action
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   of a moth or the action
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   of rust
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   moth and rust don't act suddenly
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   it's a very slow process
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   that's why
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   you used to have those disasters on railways in the
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   last century, you've read
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   the accounts of an express
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   train going over a bridge and suddenly
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   the bridge collapses, they didn't know about
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   these things then, not only
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   rust but these stresses and so on
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   it happens imperceptibly, there's nothing to be seen
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   but it's taking place
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and suddenly the first thing you know is
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   the collapse of the bridge
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   now that's something that you see so
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   clearly in the Bible and you see
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   it as I say still more clearly
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   perhaps in the subsequent history of the
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Christian Church, there's the first
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   principle then, it is tendency
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   that comes in
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   to declension and all because
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   of the conflict between form and spirit
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   secondly
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   the cause of this decline
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   is always
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   because we forget
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   first
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   and original principles
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   that's always the cause of
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   the trouble, it is always the
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   direct result of
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   forgetting an original
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   principle
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   what do I mean? Well I mean this
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   the principle is, as the epistle to
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   the Romans shows more clearly perhaps
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   than any other single epistle, is
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   that you stand by faith
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   and by faith alone
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   it's the great statement of
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   this epistle, justification is
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   by faith only, and it has always
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   been by faith only
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   it is all we are saved by
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   grace through faith, that not of yourselves
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   or as I quoted to you last
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Friday night in Romans 4, 16
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   it is by grace that it
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   might be of faith to the end
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   that the promise might be sure to all
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   the seed, in other words
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   that's the fundamental controlling
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   principle
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and when things went wrong with the Jews
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and when they go wrong in the church
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   it is always due to the forgetfulness
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   of that first principle
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   this is an astounding
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   thing
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   but it is nevertheless a fact
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   that all the greatest problems
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   in the world today are due to the forgetfulness
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   of first principles
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   not some
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   complicated involved outworking of the
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   principle, it is always the first
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   principles, isn't that
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   the whole problem of humanity today
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   you get all these commissions
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   of inquiries and this and that and proposals
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   but the whole trouble is due to
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   certain first principles
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   indeed there's only one, and that is
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   they don't realize that man is a sinner
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   and because he's a sinner he will go on
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   behaving as he does, they can bring
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   in new institutions, they can do this and that
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   the problem will remain, they don't
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   know their first principles
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   it's exactly the same with the church
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   all the troubles in the church ultimately
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   are due to the fact that we fall away
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   from justification by faith only
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   we begin to take pride in the fact that we are Jews
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   or pride in the fact that we are Gentiles
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   our good deeds and works and our church and this and that
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   we've lost it
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   it's all a question of losing
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   a grip of the first principle
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   and then the
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   third general principle
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   that I find here is this one
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   that
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   those who do fall away in that way
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   from the truth and from the
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   first principle
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   are always
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   the ones who persecute
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   most bitterly
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   those who still
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   hold to the truth in the first principle
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   it was
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   the Jews
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   who put the Messiah
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   to death
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   it was the Pharisees who were the ringleaders
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   in that with the Sadducees
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   it is always
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   the men who have themselves lost sight
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   of the first principle
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   who are the most bitter and violent opponents
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   of men who still see it and who hold to it
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   or have suddenly come to see it
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   and so the history of the church
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   shows a constant repetition
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   of what you get in the New Testament itself
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   that it is
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   those who belong to the
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   visible external
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   olive tree
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   the external Israel
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   are always the most bitter
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   persecutors of the true Israel
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   it is as true today
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   as it has always been
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   now then, there I have put
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   the principles which seem to me
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   to be taught here and which are
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   so relevant to our present situation
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   let me go on then to my second
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   big division
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   the second division is
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   the lessons of history concerning
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   these principles
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   in other words
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   the illustrations
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   see that is what your bible is
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   the bible is a great book of doctrine
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   and of truth, but it illustrates it
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   in the case of individuals, in the case of
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   nations and so on
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   now the history is invaluable
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   by way of illustration
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and the supreme illustration
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   of all is as I am saying
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   the nation of the Jews
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   oh, here it is
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   standing out before us
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   surely it should be
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   unmistakable, but alas, it isn't
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   you see, what we tend to do is
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   we look at the Jews objectively
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   we don't see that it's applying to us
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   we condemn them, look back
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   upon history and give our verdicts
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   we can't see that we are guilty of exactly the same
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   thing so often, but there it is
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   it is the supreme
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   exemplant illustration
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   these are the people who crucified
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   their own messiah, he came unto his own
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   and his own received him
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   there it is once and forever
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   but unfortunately
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   it didn't stop there
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   this has been repeated many times
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   in the history of the church
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   there was at one time
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   you can read about them in the new testament
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   a number of great churches in Asia
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   church at Ephesus
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Laodicea and other churches
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   where are they now?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   they've gone, they've disappeared
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   this very thing happened to them
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   these churches that were so privileged
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   with the preaching of the great apostle Paul
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   and others, John
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   they've disappeared, they've just vanished
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   it was the same principle
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   you get the warning concerning that
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   in the first three chapters of the book of Revelation
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   or take the case
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   of North Africa
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   oh, they were great and mighty churches
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   at one time in North Africa
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   never forget that the great Saint
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Augustine was the bishop of Hippo
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   in North Africa
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and they were rather great churches
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   where are they now? they've vanished, they've gone
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   same thing
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   they went down for the same reason
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   ultimately
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   or indeed
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   it would be very simple to show that this tended
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   to happen to the whole of the Christian church
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I've referred to this
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   on other occasions
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   so I'm not going to go into it in detail tonight
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   I made references to it
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   in my Campbell Morgan lecture back in last June
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   but
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   if you would try to discover
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   how and why it was
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   that the Christian church
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   that you read of in the New Testament
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   ever became the Roman Catholic church
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   of the Middle Ages
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   you will find that it's just this very thing
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   to which I'm referring
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   the way in which it happened
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   may be of interest
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   but it rarely can be put like this
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   in a nutshell
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   it happened solely
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   it happened solely
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   because they forgot this first principle
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   that justification is by faith only
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   that a man is not saved by his intellect
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   his understanding, any more than by his works
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   but because a number of
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Greeks became converted
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   men in the church
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   at the instigation of the devil
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   began to try to show
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   that after all the Christian teaching
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   was very similar to Greek philosophy at its best
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   it wasn't so different
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   they were persecuted
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   you see, and they were attacked
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and they had to be apologists
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and they tried to explain these things
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   and as they were doing it they were leaving their great principle
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   not many wise, not many noble
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   not many mighty accord
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   they tried to show that they were noble and that they were intellectual
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   they were denying the first principle
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   and the church became in a sense a kind of
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   philosophic institution
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I was reading strangely enough only yesterday
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   an article by a modern
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   scientist who is a Christian
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   in which he was saying exactly the same thing
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   that the tragedy was
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   that those men of the second century
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   in trying
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   to deal with the Greek humanists of those age
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   gave their whole case away
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   by becoming humanists themselves
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   and so the process went on
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   still more when Constantine
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   brought the Roman Empire into the church
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   and the result is that you get something
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   which according to the phrase of Beaning
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   is the exact opposite almost
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   of the New Testament church
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   think of the church of the New Testament
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   they haven't got buildings even
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   our Lord would sit down in a boat and teach
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   or sit on the side of a mountain
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   contrast all that with
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   all the pomp and ceremony
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and the ornate buildings of great cathedrals
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   St. Peter's in Rome or St. Paul's Cathedral
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   in London or places like that
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and Westminster Chapel in a sense
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   you see everybody was imitating all that
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   last century and they've gone astray
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   it's not primitive Christianity
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   it's all a forgetting
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   of this fundamental original principle
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and it's happened almost in every conceivable
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   section of the Christian church
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   think of Anglicanism
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   at its beginning in the 16th century
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   its clear view
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   about Rome and so on
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   look at the present Anglican church
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and its tendency
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   going back on almost everything that was done then
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   but still claiming to be the same thing
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   and it happens very slowly
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and in a very subtle manner
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   as I say throughout the centuries
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   it's equally true of non-conformity
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   take Congregationalism
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Independency
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   it started on that great principle
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   now they're proposing to do away
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   with the Congregational Union
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   and to form what will be called the Congregational Church
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   of Great Britain
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   it's the exact opposite
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   of what was started in the 17th century
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   every institution
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   tends to produce its opposite
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and we are seeing it happening
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   before our very eyes
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   you can see it equally clearly in Methodism
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   one wonders what
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   John Wesley would think and do
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   if he could come back to modern Methodism
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   they're denying
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   almost everything he stood for
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   except the circuit system
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   almost everything else they have thrown long since
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   overboard
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   now this you see is something therefore that you can see
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   in all the great divisions
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   every one of them turns itself
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   or is turned unconsciously
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   into the exact opposite of what it was at the beginning
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and all this is but I say
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   further illustration of what we see
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   so clearly in the Bible
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   look at the prophets how they remind Israel of what she once was
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   when you were young
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   says the prophet
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   oh how I led you with the cords of a man
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   and so on and how ready you were to be led
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   how you were a young virgin
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   as it were but you've become
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   just a prostitute
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   isn't that what the prophets are saying
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   how beautiful Israel was
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   how wonderful at the beginning but what she's become
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   that's the terrible thing
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and it's happened to all these
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I've known this happen even in the case of
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Clasius
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   read of Geneva
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   in the 16th century
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   and go and visit Geneva today
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   you'll find it very difficult
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   to get an evangelical sermon
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   in Geneva today, Geneva
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I could name you
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   villages
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   some of you read the early life of Harwell Harris
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Trevaka
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   and Talgoth in the days of Harwell Harris
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   go there now
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   I don't know of any more derelict districts in a spiritual sense
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I lived and was brought up partly
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   in a village called Sangheza
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   where the great Daniel Rowlands preached
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   for over 50 years
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   55 years after his
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   extraordinary conversion in 1735
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   but when I was brought up there
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   it was as dead
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   spiritually as a place could be
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   I've no recollection of ever having heard
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   the gospel truly preached there
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   we were religious but we knew nothing
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   about the fire and the life
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   and the evangelism of that
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   great and mighty man and all who worked
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   with him. What happened?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Well it's the same thing you see
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   it became the Mecca to which everybody went
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and it became proud
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   like the Jews and it lost
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   the spirit
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   it became a kind of show place
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   the spirit had gone, a shell was left
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   the husk and the kernel
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   had vanished
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and so it is
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   with so many other places that I could mention to you
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   well now there are some of the great
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   illustrations in history
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I'm trying to show you that what the apostle
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   is saying here is a principle
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   that has been operating throughout the centuries
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Old Testament but ever since
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   and happening today
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   before our very eyes
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   but the tragedy is that people don't see these things
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   then another
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   thing which seems to me to be shown here
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   very clearly by the history is this
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   is what I would call
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   the principle of delay
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   I emphasize
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   this because failure to see
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   this and to understand this has often
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   confused people. We all
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   seem to have a notion
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   that the moment we do
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   anything wrong or begin to go astray
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   that God will immediately deal with us
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   but he doesn't do that
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   there's a principle of delay
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   now you get
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   let me give you some examples of what I mean
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   God doesn't always act immediately
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I read at the beginning of Luke 13
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   these words "there were present at that season
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   some that told him of the Galileans
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   and Jesus answering
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   said unto them suppose ye
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   that these Galileans were sinners above all the
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Galileans because they suffered such
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   things I tell you nay
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   but except you repent
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   you shall all likewise perish"
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   you see they were citing a case to them
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   what about these people? His answer is what about you?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   He always does this
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   "or those eighteen upon whom
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   the tower of Siloam fell
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   and slew them think ye that they were
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I tell you nay but
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   except he repent ye shall all
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   likewise perish"
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   He speaks also of this parable
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   "a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   and he came and sought fruit thereon
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and found none then said he unto
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   the dresser of his vineyard behold
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   these three years I come
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   cut it down why cumbereth it
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   the ground and he answering
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   said unto him Lord
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   let it alone this year also
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   till I shall dig about it and
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   dung it and if it bear fruit well
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   and if not then after that
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   thou shalt cut it down
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   and he was teaching in one of the synagogues
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   on the Sabbath" now there's the great principle
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   he doesn't cut it down at once
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   he gives it another trial, waits three years
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   and is ready to listen to an argument
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   brought forward, let me try this
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   that's God's way, the principle
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   of delay, or take it
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   as it was shown, I should have
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   thought very clearly in that portion
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   which we read at the beginning
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   at the end of Matthew 21
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   another parable of our Lord
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   about these wicked husband men
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   you notice the point of the parable
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   is this, our Lord is there
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   giving a complete summary of practically the whole
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   of the Old Testament, the wicked
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   husband men of the Jews
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   they have God's vineyard
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   he's given it to them
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   to look after for him
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   and then he sends his servants to get the fruit
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   and they kill them and murder them, that's how they treated all the
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   prophets, and he goes
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   on sending more, he doesn't immediately destroy
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   them, no no he sends more than he'd sent before
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   they do the same to them
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   all the patience of God, all
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   running through the Old Testament, he doesn't at once
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   put an end to them, he's very
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   patient and at last he sends his son
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and they do
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   the same to him, and it is
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   then and only then that
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   he takes it from them, and so
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   our Lord sums it up by saying
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   shall be taken from you and given
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   to a nation, bringing forth the fruits
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   thereof, that's the Christian church
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   consisting mainly of Gentiles
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   but then there is
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   perhaps a still more striking statement
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   of it at the end of
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Matthew 23
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   our Lord's terrible denunciation
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   of the Pharisees, listen
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   from verse 34 onwards
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   wherefore behold I
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   send unto you prophets and wise
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   men and scribes and
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   some of them ye shall kill and crucify
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   and some of them shall ye scourge
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   in your synagogues and persecute them from
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   city to city, listen, that upon
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   you may come
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   all the righteous
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   blood shed upon the earth from
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   the blood of righteous Abel
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   unto the blood of Zacharias
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   the son of Barakas, whom he
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   slew between the temple and the altar
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   verily I say unto you
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   all these things shall come upon
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   this generation
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   God has been patiently
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   waiting for these people
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   sending his messengers, giving them
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   opportunities, he doesn't strike at once
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   but at last he does
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   and it all comes as it were
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   upon one particular
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   generation, that's it
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   or if you like it in the case of an
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   individual, look at our Lord's
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   patient treatment of Judas
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   he knew all about it
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   but he addresses him as friend
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   even to the very end
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   he keeps on
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   waiting patiently in this way
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   and if you want something similar
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   in the realm of history
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   is there anything more astonishing
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   than God's patience with the
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Roman Catholic Church of the Middle Ages
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   how he tolerated
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   it and allowed it to go on
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   even for centuries and it was only as it
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   were at the Protestant Reformation
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   that God acted
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   putting them on one side
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   and producing again his own
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   true church in a visible form
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   in the Protestant Reformation
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   it's the same principle
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   well now then, let me come to the
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   particular application of all that
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   to us at the present time
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   what is it? well it seems to me to be
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   perfectly plain and clear
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   the whole
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   trouble
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   with the modern ecumenical movement
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   non-Roman
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and Roman
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   is precisely
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   this thing and nothing else
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   it is
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   entirely due to this
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   very principle that the apostle is putting
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   here before us. What do I mean? Well what I mean
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   is this. What was the trouble with the Jews
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   at our Lord's time? It was this wasn't it?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   They said we are the people
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   of God. We are the lineal
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   descendants of Abraham. We are Abraham's
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   seed. We are Abraham's children
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   We come down in an unbroken line
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   from Abraham to whom all the
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   great promises were made. Therefore
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   we are saved. We are the people
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   of God. We are all right as we are
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Who is this fellow that seems to suggest
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   there's anything wrong with us?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Wasn't that it?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   And that
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   is precisely the position today
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   What is called Christendom
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   is assumed to be
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   the Christian Church. Why?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   It's assumed to be of necessity
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   the Church. Why? Well
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   simply because it is
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   the lineal descendant
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   It's come down as an unbroken
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   tradition. It's
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   the same external organization
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   It has this long history
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   coming down unbroken
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   until tonight. It's true of Roman
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Catholicism which traces itself back
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   to the original Christian Church. It's true
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   of Protestantism tracing itself back
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   to the reformers and so on
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   It's true of all the denominations
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   They are assuming that because
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   they belong to this same
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   organization, to this one
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   unbroken tradition, that they are of necessity
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Christians
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   The external organization
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   is regarded as the Church
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   The tradition
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   is regarded as a guarantee that we're
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   all right
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   There is no concern
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   about the purity of the Church
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   There seems to be no concern
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   about the message of the Church
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   and the faith and the practice of the Church
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Because a man
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   is a dignitary in the Church
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   well then it's assumed that he must be a Christian
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Though he tells you in his sermons
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and in his books quite plainly
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   that he's not a Christian
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   he still argues that he must be
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   because he belongs to the Church
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   and it's very terrible to say that he's not a Christian
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   In other words, what makes a man a Christian is that he belongs to the Church
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   not what he believes any longer
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   You see, we've left the principle
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   It is no longer justification by faith only
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   You can deny the deity of Christ
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   You can deny the miracles
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   You can deny the atoning sacrifice
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   You can deny the literal resurrection
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You can deny all these things
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   and the rebirth
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   and justification by faith only
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   But still you're regarded as a Christian
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Well, because you're a member of the Church
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   and every member of the Church is a Christian
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Why is he a member of the Church if he isn't a Christian?
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   That's the argument
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   The organization has taken the place of the spirit
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Tradition has taken the place of truth
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Men are no longer concerned in the truth
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   which is believed or in a corresponding life
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   The original basis of what makes a Church a Church
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   is entirely forgotten
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   And the assumption behind the ecumenical movement is
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   that because of the historical and external continuity
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   of the organization
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   that it is of necessity the Church
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   I say that that was precisely the error and the sin
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   of the nation of the Jews
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   when they rejected their Messiah
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   and which caused God to pluck them out of the olive tree
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and of course they're proving the analogy still valid
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   but the question is
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   how can you deny the truth
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   and the truth is the answer
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   to the question
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   of the Church
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   and the truth is the answer
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   and of course they're proving the analogy still further today
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   by persecuting those
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   who are still holding to the original principle
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   They say that those of us who say things like this
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   are not Christians
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   because we're lacking in a Christian spirit
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   which means that you allow anything to be said
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   and that you never criticize
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   that you always praise everybody
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   that you're never negative
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   They are persecuting those who hold to the original principle
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   as an apostate Church has ever done
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   since the days
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   when the nation of Israel herself
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   became apostate
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   The modern ecumenical movement
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   is an exact
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   reproduction
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   of the very thing that the Apostle is dealing with
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   in this section
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Let me give you one other thought
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   I feel that here also
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   the whole question of
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   children brought up in the Church
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   is acutely involved
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   because
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   they of all people are encouraged
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   to assume that they're Christians
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   because they were sprinkled when they were
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   children or because
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   they've always been brought to Church and have always been in the atmosphere
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   They were never anything else
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I'm not saying that they are not Christians
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   They are, so many of them, thank God
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   All I'm saying is this
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   that this tendency
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   is greater in them than in anybody else
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   The danger of assuming
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   that because you belong to the organization
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   that you're of necessity a Christian
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   The danger of forgetting
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   the vital principle
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   which is justification by faith only
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   individual experience of God
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   and of the rebirth
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Think that out for yourselves
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   It's not as acute a problem
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   as the ecumenical one, but it's a very real problem
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Very well then, I say next
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   What is it that awaits us?
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   And the answer is
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   that no man can prophesy
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   because of this principle
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   of delay that I've been showing you
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   All I know is this
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   that there is a day coming
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   when the apostate Church
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   however big and powerful
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   she may be, will be
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   cast out
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   will be spewed out of the mouth of God
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   You get the account
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   of that in Revelations chapter 17
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   and 18, it is coming
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   The great world Church that we are
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   hearing so much about is going to be spewed
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   out as the apostate
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   vile thing that it is
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   And the sons of God will stand out
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   in the brightness of their glory
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I don't know when
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   I can't prophesy what may happen
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   These tendencies may go on and on
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   There is this comfort, there is this hope
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Something great and tremendous is going to happen
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   amongst the Jews before that happens
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   But that will happen
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   There is ultimately
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   going to be not only a sifting
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   but this retribution
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   the principle at the end of Matthew 23
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   is still working
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Very well then, my last word is this
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   What is the way of safety for us in the light of all
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   these things?
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   My first answer is, never forget
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Romans 11, 22
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   That's the best advice I can give
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Keep Romans 11, 22 before you
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Behold therefore the goodness
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   and severity of God on them which
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   fell severity but toward thee goodness
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   if thou continue in his goodness
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   otherwise thou also shalt be cut off
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   What's it mean? It means the need of
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   constant self-examination
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Let him that thinketh
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   he standeth take heed lest he fall
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Don't rely upon the fact
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   that you are sound in doctrine now
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   There's no guarantee that you'll be in a year's time
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Be careful lest
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   in your correctness of doctrine you may
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   become hard in your spirit and make your doctrine
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   of no value to you
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Thank God for any gifts he has given you
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Don't begin to rely upon them
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   because if you do, what applies to you
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   is 1 Corinthians 13
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Though I speak with the tongue of men and of angels
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   and have not charity, though I have faith that I could
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   remove mountains and so on, though I understand
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   all mysteries, it's no good
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Your sounding breast, tinkling cymbal
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   all your knowledge is of no value to you
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   You see how subtle this thing is
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Self-examination
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Constant fear
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Be not high-minded but fear
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Always realize this danger
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Always check yourself
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   by the original principle
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Lest you should in a very subtle and slow manner
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   be drifting away from it
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   The next thing I say is this
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   You and I
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   are responsible only for ourselves
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   and for our age
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   We are responsible for this
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   but we cannot legislate for the future
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   When I say things like this
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   to some people, they say, "All right, we agree with you
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   but if we do what you're saying, is it
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   any guarantee that things will be all right
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   in a hundred years' time?" The answer is no
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   but I'm not responsible for what my
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   grandchildren may do, neither are you
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   But you are responsible for what
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   you do. Every man
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   shall bear his own burdens
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   You cannot legislate for the future
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   but our business is to see
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   always that the church is pure
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Pure in our doctrine
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Pure in our practice, whatever the costs
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   But we can't guarantee
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   that it's going to continue. The church has been
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   so pure many times
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   but always this other principle seems to come in
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   They fall away from the original
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   but we are responsible for our
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   own day and generation
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   And lastly
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   It seems to me quite inevitable
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   that our duty is clear
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   that we have nothing
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   to do with a
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   church which
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   is guilty of repeating
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   the fatal error
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   and sin of the Jewish nation
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   We have nothing to do
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   with a church that is apostate
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   with a church that
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   puts organization before the truth
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   tradition before the truth
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   which has forgotten the very
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   being and existence of itself
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   the principle that has ever brought
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   into being and has made it what it is
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   a church which has departed from that
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   is no longer a church
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   And for us to be associated
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   with such a body is to partake of
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   its sin and to be partly
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   responsible for its apostasy
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Well my dear friends
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   there are some of the things
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   which seem to me to be spoken
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   so plainly and so clearly to us
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   at this very moment
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   by this amazing statement of the
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   great apostle in Romans
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   11 verses
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   16 to 22
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   May God apply them
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   to our minds and hearts
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   and spirits and give us grace
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   to be obedient. If he
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   know these things
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   happy are he
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   if he do them
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Let us pray
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Oh Lord
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   our God we come back unto thee
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   we thank thee
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   that we can do so
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   we are conscious of our own
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   unworthiness
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   we see in ourselves these tendencies
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   about which we have
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   been speaking together
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   we know that we are
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   what we are by thy grace
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   and by that alone
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Oh Lamb of God
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   still keep me close
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   to thy pierced side
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   'tis only there in safety
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   and peace
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   I can abide
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   what snares
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   and foes surround me
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   what fears
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   and lusts within
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   the grace that sought
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   and found me
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   alone can keep me
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   clean
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   thou alone can keep us
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   clean in doctrine
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   and in practice
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Lord bless thy word to us
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   write it deeply
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   we pray thee in our minds and hearts
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   and consciences and wills
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   and oh God
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   give us that spiritual
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   courage to practice what we believe
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   to put into
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   execution
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   what we see in thy word
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   Oh Lord
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   look down upon us in pity and
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   in compassion and lead
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   us on by
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   thy spirit
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   we thank thee that we know
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   that the ultimate victory
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   is certain and secure
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   keep us faithful
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   until that great
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   and glorious
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   and wonderful day shall dawn
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   and now
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   may the grace of our Lord
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   and Saviour Jesus Christ
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   and the love of God
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   and the fellowship and the communion of the
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Holy Spirit abide
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   and continue with us now
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   this night throughout the
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   remainder of this hour's short
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   uncertain earthly
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   life and pilgrimage
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   and until we shall
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   be safely in the
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   glory everlasting
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   Amen
