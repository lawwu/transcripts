[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   Devin Larratt, you son of a bitch.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.160]   Thanks for coming.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.080]   What's the matter?
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.840]   MIT got you pushing too many pencils?
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.240]   All right, you got me.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.520]   Now, if I wanted to beat you, what would I do here?
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.240]   It starts before we even arm wrestle.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.680]   It's all postural, really.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.320]   So if I can make you come to me,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.520]   this is the first step.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.240]   Always make me come to you.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.440]   Exactly. It lets you use more muscles
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.880]   against less muscles.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.080]   You target weakness, right?
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.520]   You target my fingertips.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.840]   You get to use more muscles.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.640]   So you see this ridge?
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.960]   Very important.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.440]   The higher up this ridge is in my hand,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.880]   the better.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.560]   The more the pressure is in my fingers
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.800]   as opposed to your fingers, the better.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.720]   Right.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.680]   What are some basics here that you should know?
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.680]   Okay, maybe we'll start with a move called the post.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.320]   The post, by itself, is not that powerful of a move,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.640]   but it's a fantastic opening.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.960]   Once you have a post established,
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.080]   the world completely opens up for you.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.320]   The post is very simply
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.880]   an upwards drive of the knuckles.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.400]   And there are also climbs at this point.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   Yes, exactly.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.560]   And it's all about generating better angles.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.920]   That's it.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.480]   You're always trying, like if you open up your hand,
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.280]   you're always trying to get deeper as well.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.880]   So you're trying to get deeper and deeper.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.160]   Climbing up and over.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.200]   Both.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   That's it. Advancing that position all the time.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.440]   So you're always climbing.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.720]   You're always climbing over and up.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.760]   That's the goal.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.880]   Always climbing, always improving position.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.200]   A, B, C.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.000]   Always be climbing.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.520]   So basically, inside and outside,
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   that'll be your first division.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.360]   So when we're arm wrestling outside,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.400]   basically, it's all these pulling motions.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.320]   Pulling, pulling.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.880]   And to some degree, they all attack the fingers.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.240]   Okay.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.840]   A standard top roll will look something like this.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.160]   I'll start to apply pressure up into the fingers.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.040]   I'll start to bend my wrist.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.840]   And as I'm bending my wrist,
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.760]   you will be attempting to bend your wrist
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.080]   and I will block you with something called pronation,
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   which is this turning.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.400]   And I'll carry through the fingers
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.600]   and I'll take you all the way to the pin pad
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.640]   through the fingertips.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.200]   It's a fantastic move for beating people.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.080]   It's one of the best techniques in arm wrestling, the top roll.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.680]   Most world champions, I would say,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.240]   I'd say most use top roll.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.800]   I also seen you compliment somebody that,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.920]   you know, it's not over here yet.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.960]   No.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.800]   You can hold some of the strongest people in the world like this.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.120]   And that's, I think you were complimenting somebody
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.480]   that they were able to do that against.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.560]   Another way to talk about arm wrestling,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.040]   so we started to touch on like the top roll,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.440]   the hook.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.080]   So a hook is basically
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.200]   wrist flexor driven.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   Right. So it's more about attacking the person's pronation.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.640]   So you establish a hook
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.000]   and then you can pull out of it
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.120]   or you make it more of a press
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.600]   and it's more shoulders coming right forward
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.480]   and you're coming right in on the person.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.600]   Okay.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.120]   So hooking and pressing are,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.880]   all the moves in arm wrestling are similar.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.080]   Okay. Just subtle differences.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.840]   But the roll results in an asymmetric.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.880]   Like I'm losing, you're winning.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.920]   Right.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.960]   Feels like the hook is where...
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.160]   You get to stay in the match a little bit more.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.200]   You stay in the match.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.240]   You do, yeah.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.600]   But a good arm wrestler
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.240]   isn't going to necessarily give you that.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.440]   Like they're not,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.880]   you don't see a lot of world class matches
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.960]   where the guy is just pressing.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.080]   You don't see it.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.480]   The controversial King's move. What is that?
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.120]   Okay. So the King's move is actually,
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.160]   it's a defensive move.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   Okay. So the only thing I'm trying to do
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.760]   when I King's move
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.160]   is I'm trying to attack your arm angle
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.520]   through dragging.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.960]   Okay.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.680]   And I'm trying to target your fingers
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.720]   through pronation.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.560]   I'm trying to do all the other things as well.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.800]   But these are my anchors.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.160]   Okay. So I'll fight for all the other stuff
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.200]   but I'll give them away.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.880]   This is the one that I hold.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.720]   So I will turn.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.240]   Right. And a lot of times there's a dipping.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.880]   Okay.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.440]   So you're pulling also.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.360]   Am I, are you like basically
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.400]   pulling me towards you?
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   I'll try.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.120]   But I may not be able to.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.800]   So normally a King's move
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.440]   is used against a very strong opponent.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.960]   The King's move is throwing a big wrench
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.040]   into the sport.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.920]   But this has been happening
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.240]   a lot as the sport evolves.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.480]   The King's move is here to stay.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.160]   Where do the injuries come from?
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.200]   Right here.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.240]   That's the one.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.920]   The bad one is the break.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.240]   Is the break.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.280]   Of what?
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.720]   Humerus.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.760]   Oh wow.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.800]   Right here.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.840]   So literally break your arm.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.880]   Past your frame man.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.920]   We are, we're like
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.960]   [imitates breaking]
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.000]   So not a bicep tear.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.040]   Not.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.080]   It can happen. Bicep tears can happen.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.040]   I'd say that the break
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.400]   is the one that's.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.440]   It's a literal arm break.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.920]   And when it goes it's like.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.960]   [smack]
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yep.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.400]   Wow.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.440]   The strongest arm I've ever felt in my life.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.480]   [laughter]
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.520]   And he's not even trying.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.920]   I'm very specialized.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.840]   I'm a super specialized athlete.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.200]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.240]   Devon Larratt.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.280]   This is a huge honor.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   Me too.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.360]   [cheering]
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.400]   You got it.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.440]   Right there.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.480]   Come on.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.520]   You got it.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.600]   You got it.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.640]   Go.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.680]   Go.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.720]   Go.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.800]   [cheering]
