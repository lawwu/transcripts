[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.020]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.860]   >> Here with another episode of Curious Mike,
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.340]   I'm sitting here with Dr. Amen.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.380]   Appreciate you being on the podcast my bro.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.760]   >> Thank you so much.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.540]   >> Yeah. So we just got done.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.940]   I just got done with my brain scan.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.740]   I've been wanting to do something like this for a while.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.300]   But you actually, you worked in the army for 10 years,
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.460]   and then you were helping on the medic side.
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.400]   So you've always wanted to help get people better.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.000]   How did you get into the more this side of it,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.300]   looking at people's brains and helping people get better from that standpoint?
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.960]   >> So when I was an infantry medic,
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.900]   about a year into doing that,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.440]   I realized I didn't like being shot at,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.460]   that it wasn't for me.
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.020]   Some people like it,
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.860]   and I got retrained as an x-ray technician,
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.860]   and developed a passion for medical imaging.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.340]   As our professors used to say,
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.300]   how do you know unless you look?
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.460]   Then I got out of the army,
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.780]   went to medical school,
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660]   and when I was a second year medical student,
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.140]   someone I loved tried to kill herself.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.420]   I took her to see a wonderful psychiatrist,
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.300]   and I came to realize if he helped her,
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.740]   it wouldn't just help her,
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.100]   that ultimately it would help her children and her grandchildren.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.000]   So I fell in love with psychiatry because I realized it can change generations of people.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.700]   But I fell in love with the only medical specialty that never looks at the organ it treats.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.300]   Most people go, "I'm depressed," and they get medicine,
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.060]   with nobody looking at their brain,
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.660]   and I'm like, "That's insane."
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.860]   So we started looking at the brain about 30 years ago,
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.940]   and it's been so exciting.
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.700]   Because what I learned is depression is not one thing,
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.980]   or having ADD, it's not one thing,
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.460]   or people who are anxious,
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.380]   sometimes it's from a head injury,
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.660]   or sometimes it's from toxic exposure,
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.340]   or sometimes it's because no one knows how to manage their mind.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.500]   But if you don't look, you don't know.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.260]   And then I realized, well, your brain's an organ like your heart's an organ,
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.220]   so you've got to keep that healthy,
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.780]   or you're more vulnerable to not being your best.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.540]   Right, and we went through kind of my stuff.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.100]   Self-control was an area I wanted to get better at.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.980]   But a lot of people, like you said, deal with depression, anxiety,
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.900]   making poor decisions, whatever it is.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.740]   You get judged for what you do,
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.260]   and a lot of people just will tell you,
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.220]   especially, you know, we're both men of faith,
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.180]   like the church a lot of times will judge people and say,
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.500]   "You know, just don't do this."
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.860]   But you're saying there's a deeper issue,
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100]   and it can stem from a head injury,
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.620]   it can stem from toxins in your body,
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.420]   all this stuff that could be affecting your brain.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.500]   So you're looking at it from a completely different standpoint
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.580]   and saying, "No, like, when your brain gets more healthy,
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.500]   "you'll be able to go out and live better
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.700]   "and do the things you want to do more effectively."
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.100]   And what roadblocks do you think you have?
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.300]   What do you think could be better?
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.100]   Um, I think... I was just talking to them about this,
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.780]   but I think I'm very, like, disciplined in some areas,
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.940]   but then in other areas...
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180]   Like, when it comes to, like, my workouts and my health
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.500]   and all this different stuff, I'm very disciplined.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.580]   But then other areas, I'm sometimes not consistent,
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.060]   and then that plays a toll on my mental
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.500]   because I feel like when you...
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.860]   A lot of it is your systems, like, you know,
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.700]   getting on a schedule and then maintaining it
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.900]   and, you know, consistently making the right choices.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.700]   And then, obviously, you're more mentally, like, there.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.660]   When you're making mistakes or things you don't want to do,
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.180]   then it can take a toll on your mental, I feel like.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.660]   So I feel like some of those things, for me,
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.740]   that's something I want to improve on,
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.060]   like consistency off the court.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.460]   Consistency as far as the decisions you make...
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.820]   -Decisions... -...on what you eat
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.900]   or what you drink or...
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.660]   Not... Nothing at all with health
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.180]   or what I put in my body or things like that,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.260]   but more, like, you know, consistency,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.380]   practicing, like, my faith,
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.380]   like, getting into my Bible every day
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.180]   or consistency, you know, hanging around the right girls.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.540]   Things like that, for me, are kind of like a hindrance at times.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.140]   Like, I don't feel like I have an addictive personality
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.300]   as far as, you know, drugs or alcohol,
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.300]   but some of the other stuff, like,
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.420]   I just have a certain pull towards it
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.180]   that I wish wasn't there, you know what I mean?
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.700]   -And so if you had a bit better self-control, that would help.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.740]   -Yeah, that'd definitely help.
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.380]   -Ever have a concussion or a head injury?
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.900]   -I didn't have a concussion.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.420]   Never had a concussion, I don't think,
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.700]   but I hit a car with my head.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.900]   I don't know if you can see that scar right there,
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.700]   the little scar right there.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.660]   Yeah, this is when I was young, young,
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.860]   probably 12 or 13-ish.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.700]   10, 9, 10, probably 9 or 10,
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.900]   and I'm riding with my friend on a bike,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.660]   and I'm looking back at him,
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.460]   and his mom was with us, and his mom was like,
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.500]   "Michael, look," so I turn, and that car,
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.700]   like, a parked car is right there,
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.180]   and I hit it with my head right here,
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.060]   and I, like, flip over the car.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.660]   Ended up going to the emergency room and everything.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.460]   Just had stitches.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.980]   I don't know how severe it was, but I definitely hit my head.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.220]   That's the only, like, major head trauma that I've had, though.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.460]   -You have a scar there.
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.940]   What's that from, the other side?
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.020]   -Right here? -No, in your eyebrow.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.860]   -Oh, right here? That's just swag.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.380]   -Oh, that's purposeful.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.980]   -That's swag, yeah.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.500]   That's just swag.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.540]   -Your brain controls everything you do,
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.980]   how you think, how you feel, how you act,
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.380]   how you get along with other people.
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.180]   It's the organ of intelligence, character,
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.180]   and every decision you make,
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.420]   and when your brain works right, you work right,
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.020]   and when your brain is troubled for whatever reason,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.420]   you have more trouble in your life,
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.220]   and it's easy to judge people.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.700]   It's harder to go, "Why?"
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.020]   -No doubt, and I know, like, even for me,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.660]   doing this whole session right now was so --
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.100]   It, like, it almost lifts a weight off your shoulders
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.660]   'cause you realize, no, not everything is your fault.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.620]   You could have gone through some trauma
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.140]   or something that caused you to be the way you are,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.540]   but, like you showed me,
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.060]   there's a way to reverse some of this stuff,
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.220]   and there's a way to heal and things like that.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.980]   So, for me, looking at my brain and everything,
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.020]   what did you see was, like, my kind of issues
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.140]   and how I can get better?
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.500]   -Okay, moment of truth.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.060]   -Let's do it.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.740]   -So, we did a study called SPECT,
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.140]   and SPECT looks at blood flow and activity.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.660]   It looks at how your brain works,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.460]   and it basically shows us three things.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.580]   Good activity -- you have a lot.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.460]   Too little activity --
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.660]   there's some going on we have to talk about.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.540]   And too much, and that's not the issue.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.300]   So, here's an example of a healthy scan.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.260]   We're gonna look at it in two ways.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.580]   This looks at the outside surface,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.020]   and it should be full, even, and symmetrical.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.180]   So, this view, we're looking underneath the brain.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.140]   Top is the front part of the brain.
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.780]   Bottom is the back.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.340]   This is your cerebellum,
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.380]   which I would expect in an NBA player to just be great.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.940]   Here, blue is average activity.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.900]   Red and white are the most active parts of the brain,
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.820]   which should be back here.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.460]   This is the cerebellum.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.140]   And then the visual cortex here.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.780]   We look at your scan.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.220]   I don't like it so much.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.540]   It's low in activity.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.580]   And is that from trauma?
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.660]   I think part of it,
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.300]   'cause I can actually see here in the back,
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.900]   your head got whacked.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.820]   And as you described it,
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.900]   you're going on a bike, and you're turned this way,
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.780]   and someone says, "Hey, Michael,"
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.340]   and you go here, boom, and then you flip.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.380]   That's a lot of force.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.220]   Your brain is the consistency of soft butter,
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.820]   tofu, custard, somewhere between egg whites and Jell-O.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.700]   And if you look inside a skull,
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.900]   it has sharp, bony ridges.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.060]   So I've asked God many times,
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.500]   "Why haven't you put bumper guards?"
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.740]   He goes, "Who knew they would play football?"
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.380]   But it got whacked at some point.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.660]   So if I can make this better,
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.340]   and I'm gonna show you how to do that,
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.740]   you're gonna have more mental horsepower.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.900]   And when you go, "I want to make this decision,"
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.940]   you'll be more likely to follow through.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.100]   But we need to fix this, 'cause five years from now,
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.980]   let's say you didn't care about your health,
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.340]   and you went out drinking and not sleeping,
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.080]   and some of the things you see other NBA players do,
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.780]   you won't make good decisions,
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.500]   which means you won't last as long, right?
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.380]   Now, here, blue is average activity.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.500]   Your cerebellum is awesome, it's healthy.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.900]   I like that.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.980]   Emotional brain's up a little bit,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.620]   but I'm not concerned about this.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.280]   If I fix this, you will love me forever.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.260]   - So there's supposed to be no holes?
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.720]   - Supposed to be no holes.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.020]   With the holes, and you don't have holes in your brain.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.580]   How I make these pictures is I tell the computer
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.540]   I want to see a certain level of activity.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.540]   Anything below it shows up as a hole or a dent.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.420]   But what it means is your brain isn't healthy,
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.820]   and we need to fix it.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.960]   If I get you a healthy brain,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.700]   you'll have the best season you've ever had, right?
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.700]   'Cause it's about consistency, and decision-making,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.480]   and mental energy, right?
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.500]   And with blood flow, caffeine decreases blood flow,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.420]   so I'd limit it.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.780]   - Everybody wanna say caffeine's good for 'em.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.700]   - Yeah, it's not.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.400]   - I knew it.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.700]   - Nicotine, not good.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.300]   Do you vape?
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.140]   - I don't.
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.620]   - Good, don't.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.460]   So, for probably a couple of different reasons,
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.700]   when you were eight or nine,
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.540]   your head hit another car, right, in a bike accident.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.060]   That mattered, I mean, I can still see evidence of that.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.600]   You've had heavy metals in your body,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.020]   and you had general anesthesia.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.240]   All of that led to lower blood flow.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.540]   And the cool thing is we're gonna reverse that,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.340]   but it'll make you struggle more,
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.020]   and you don't want to, right?
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.620]   'Cause you and I both never wanna be normal.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.300]   We wanna be optimal.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.360]   And in order to be optimal,
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.920]   the computer has to work right, right?
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.820]   So, I almost think of it like hardware and software.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.860]   If we get the physical function of your brain
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.600]   as healthy as it can be,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.020]   you can then be the best you can be.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.140]   - Gotcha.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.020]   So, like I've heard it all the time,
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.080]   like around 25, your brain stops,
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.480]   like you're fully developed.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.860]   But you show me some brain scans of people who are 55,
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.500]   and then you scan 'em again at 65,
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.460]   and their brain is more healthy.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.660]   So, where does that come from?
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.260]   And like what stops happening at 25?
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.340]   And then like what is there you can do after that?
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.500]   - So, for girls, their brains
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.260]   are pretty much fully developed at 25.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.940]   For boys, we're always behind.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.060]   It's more like 27 or 28.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.740]   So, there's this process in the brain called myelinization
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.040]   where nerve cells get wrapped
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.620]   with a white fatty substance called myelin.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.220]   And when they get wrapped, they become more efficient.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.340]   They work like 100 times faster.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.660]   And myelin starts to be deposited in little kids
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.060]   at two months in their visual cortex in the back,
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.820]   and then slowly, about 25,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.980]   finishes myelinating their frontal lobes.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.820]   And that's why early drug abuse is a disaster
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.180]   because it stops that beautiful developmental process
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.860]   that's what maturity is about, right?
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.180]   Maturity is you just don't make
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.860]   the same stupid mistakes you made before, right?
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.380]   You're learning.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.060]   But if the organ of decision-making isn't healthy,
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:06.060]   it's not properly developed, that's a problem for you.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.420]   Now, we have a lot of experience
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.660]   of taking brains that are troubled
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.700]   and making them better.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.700]   And so, every day, your brain is becoming better or worse
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.140]   depending on how you slept, what you ate,
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.880]   the nutrients you took, the amount of stress you're under.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.940]   I was on TV yesterday, it was just terrible.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.980]   A new study came out.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.660]   Depression in children doubled during the pandemic
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.860]   because of the isolation, the fear, the social unrest,
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.580]   the political divide.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.740]   And it's just horrifying.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.900]   We need to teach children to love their brains,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.020]   take care of it, and then discipline their minds, right?
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.760]   People think of physical discipline.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.540]   You're a professional athlete.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.140]   It's not something you do once.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.320]   It's something you do over and over and over again
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.640]   so you can maintain a high level of performance.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.900]   Well, mental discipline's the same way.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.060]   We have to do that over and over and over
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.380]   so we can maintain a high level of mental performance.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.660]   - That makes sense.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.540]   And you just, I actually was gonna get into this,
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.500]   but you're saying, you said before COVID and after COVID,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.060]   you've seen a big difference
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.460]   in especially young people's brain,
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.920]   but general population, it's a big difference
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.760]   that you've seen?
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.860]   - Big difference, in part because of the stress.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.060]   And we also talked about COVID.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.540]   And COVID can activate the emotional centers of the brain
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.420]   and put people at higher risk for emotional issues.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.540]   - That makes sense.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.140]   So obviously not everybody has the money or the time
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.020]   to come scan their brain, although everyone should.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.980]   So what's like, for the majority of brains you saw,
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.500]   especially for young people, and then we'll go to old people,
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.100]   what are some practical things everyone can do
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.620]   to keep their brain as healthy as possible
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.860]   without even scanning it?
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.140]   Like what's some day-to-day things?
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.700]   - Well, I mean, the first thing is to love your brain.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.420]   And nobody loves their brain, why?
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.960]   Because you can't see it.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.500]   You can see the wrinkles in your skin
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.180]   or the fat around your belly,
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.160]   and you can do something when you're unhappy with it.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.980]   But because most people never look, they don't care.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.260]   When I looked at my brain first time in 1991,
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.620]   I was the top neuroscience student in medical school.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.400]   I'm a double board certified psychiatrist,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.640]   and I didn't care at all about my brain.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.460]   And then when I saw it and it wasn't healthy,
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.360]   'cause I played football in high school, I had bad habits,
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.460]   I'm like, no, I have to care about this.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.600]   And then I've spent the last 30 years making it better.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.460]   So one, you have to care about it.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.060]   That's the first thing.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.980]   And then avoid things that hurt it.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.860]   You just have to know the list.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.780]   I went to my daughter's second grade class
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.740]   and I put 20 things on the board.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.300]   And I go, okay, you tell me,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.500]   good for your brain or bad for it.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.860]   Football, everybody put bad for it.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.780]   Hitting soccer balls with their head, bad.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.100]   Smoking, bad.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.140]   Marijuana, bad.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.140]   Even the second graders know it, right?
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.340]   I mean, there's this whole discussion in society,
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.180]   but second graders know it's not good for your brain.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.440]   Alcohol, bad.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.840]   Ice cream, they love it, but bad.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.900]   The only thing they missed was orange juice,
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.520]   which they put in the good category,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.220]   but it's way too much sugar.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.780]   Whenever, eating the sugar from six oranges,
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.540]   how does that make any sense?
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.900]   Eat the orange, don't drink the juice.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.300]   - Eat the orange, don't drink the juice.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.220]   I actually, that's surprising to me
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.820]   'cause I'm someone that eats a lot of fruits and vegetables
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.500]   and I was always told like the sugar between the two
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.340]   are a lot different.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.500]   So I thought that oranges
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.500]   would actually be good for your brain, like orange.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.640]   - Oranges are good for your brain, not the juice.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.540]   So whenever you unwrap sugar from its fiber source,
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.580]   it turns toxic in your body.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.340]   So fructose can actually give you fatty liver.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.780]   It's really interesting.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.580]   There's a wonderful YouTube video
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.660]   called "Sugar, the Bitter Truth" by Robert Lustig.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.940]   If you watch that, you'll never drink fruit juice again.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.780]   - That's crazy.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.500]   Yeah, I came in here knowing
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.380]   that some things were toxic for your brain.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.540]   Obviously like alcohol or getting hit in the head
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.500]   that's bad for you or going to McDonald's every day,
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.460]   certain foods are bad for you.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.220]   But there's like a big debate going on,
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.660]   especially now like all these places
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.460]   have legalized marijuana and are saying,
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.820]   all these studies are coming out
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.420]   saying it could be beneficial for you
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.700]   'cause of this or that.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.060]   But you look at the brains.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.860]   Like all these people that are making these assumptions
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.900]   about what it does,
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.500]   they're not looking at what it does to your brain
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.660]   and you've done extensive research
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.500]   and you're saying like no,
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.180]   marijuana's definitely a negative for your brain.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.580]   - So when I first started scanning people,
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.020]   I would see people who were using marijuana,
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.740]   their brain looked toxic.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.940]   It looked older than they were.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.860]   And now, is it bad in every situation all the time?
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.700]   No.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.660]   For my father-in-law who had cancer
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:28.140]   and it was terminal, it helped him eat.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.100]   That was good.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.100]   Some people with resistant seizures seems to be helpful.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.500]   But to just say it's innocuous is a lie.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.940]   I published a study on 62,000 scans on how the brain ages.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.740]   It's the largest imaging study ever.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.380]   And then we looked at, well, what accelerates aging?
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.100]   And having schizophrenia was the worst.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.300]   Your brain looked 10 years older.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.380]   Marijuana was the second worst.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.580]   It surprised me.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.540]   It ages the brain and I don't know about you,
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.860]   but I want a young brain.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.820]   I don't want an older brain.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.220]   And Miley Cyrus is one of my patients
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.060]   and that came out public last year and I love her.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.780]   But I couldn't get her to stop smoking pot
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.460]   for the longest time.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.060]   It's not good for you.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.720]   And then I figured out the secret.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.240]   There's a part of your brain called the hippocampus.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.900]   It's on the inside of your temporal lobes.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.360]   And the hippocampus is Greek for seahorse.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.020]   And every day, it's one of the few areas of your brain
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.420]   that produces stem cells.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.220]   So it actually makes new cells every day,
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.620]   like 700 new cells every day.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.780]   And I was telling her, it's like your brain
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.620]   is making 700 new baby seahorses.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.700]   And her eyes got big 'cause she knew what I was doing.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.820]   And she's an animal lover.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.040]   She said, "Dr. Raymond, it's so unfair."
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.900]   I said, "You're murdering the seahorses, right?
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.420]   "If you wanna grow your brain, you can grow your brain.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.820]   "You have to put it in a healing environment."
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.080]   And the problem with marijuana, it's fat soluble.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.280]   What that means is if you smoke today
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   or you do an edible today, we can measure it for 30 days.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.360]   So it's like you make this one decision today,
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.840]   you're sort of making this decision for a month.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.720]   - That's a good point.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.080]   I asked you this earlier, but I was like, okay.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.600]   So say you're not an alcoholic or you don't drink a ton,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.680]   but you do certain things and you say,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   oh, it's just a balance.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.000]   Like I'm gonna be good most of the time,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.400]   but then I'm gonna make certain decisions
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.720]   like once in a while.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.560]   Or I'm gonna eat bad once in a while.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.000]   Or smoke once in a while.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.400]   But some of these things, even though you do 'em
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.800]   once in a while or as a balance,
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.120]   they have lasting impacts on your brain.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   And we talked earlier about is it helping heal my brain
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.480]   or take away from it?
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.880]   Or what's the consequences of doing these things?
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.520]   And I thought that that was pretty interesting
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.240]   'cause I know a lot of people,
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.160]   especially young people,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.920]   like they'll justify making certain decisions
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.600]   'cause they've been doing good for a while
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.680]   and now they just wanna wild out for a night,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.520]   whatever it is.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.680]   But it has lasting impacts for your brain.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.600]   - Well, and there's the little lies that,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.920]   I would call 'em the little lies
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.840]   that make people fat, depressed, and feeble-minded.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.440]   And one of the little lies is everything in moderation.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.020]   Everything in moderation is the gateway thought to hell.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.360]   Because it's like, well, I'll cheat this
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.640]   and then I'll do that.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.840]   And then I'll, and I'm like, it's my brain.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.080]   I don't wanna be in moderation.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.640]   I want to love my brain.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.920]   And actually doing the right thing
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.000]   is never about deprivation.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.440]   So Drew Carey, the famous comedian,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.080]   he lost a lot of weight and he kept it off.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.360]   And there's this quote that I knew he would keep it off.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.360]   He said, "Eating crappy food isn't a reward.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.080]   "It's a punishment."
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.320]   Because he knew what it did to his body.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.240]   And so when you go, I wanna reward myself,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.880]   it's like, well, it's something that you love
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.720]   that loves you back.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.280]   That if I ever open up a restaurant,
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.240]   I wanna call it loves you back
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.560]   because I love the shake I have in the morning.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.640]   I generally love a big salad with protein on it,
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.520]   with veggies, and I love that stuff, right?
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.000]   I pick things I love.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.120]   Like I make a brain-healthy hot chocolate every night,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   raw cacao, unsweetened organic, vanilla almond milk,
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.400]   little chocolate stevia in it.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.800]   It tastes great.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.160]   I love it.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.240]   And cacao's a superfood.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.680]   I love it back.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.040]   It loves me back.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.440]   - There's plenty of good things you can find,
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.360]   especially nowadays.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.200]   People are becoming more health conscious
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   than they used to be.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.960]   There's so many good restaurants that have healthy food.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   My next question is, you see,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.160]   like what are the biggest outwardly things
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.600]   that people struggle with or that they do
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.480]   in a bad brain that you see versus like a very healthy brain?
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.560]   What is the outward difference in how they live,
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.320]   their mood, like all those things?
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.600]   What's the biggest few outwardly things?
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.000]   - Well, with a healthy brain, you're a better friend.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.040]   You don't interrupt as much.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.240]   You listen.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.940]   You care about what's going on with the other person.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.420]   You're better at managing your money.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.060]   You're more thoughtful.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:59.920]   People sort of like you more because you're consistent,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.280]   reliable, reasonably on time.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.840]   The things that sort of make life work
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.640]   come with a healthier brain.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.840]   - A lot of people these days,
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.560]   they try to separate like science and faith.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.120]   And one thing we talked about earlier
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.960]   was how you take mind, body, spirit,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.760]   all these different things and you put them all into one.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.520]   How do you kind of do that?
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.320]   Like how do they all come together?
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.880]   And you were saying earlier like your brain helps you
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.280]   even with your relationship with God
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.120]   or how you hear him or how you can be effective for him
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.240]   in your purpose, how do you put all those things together?
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.200]   'Cause a lot of people will try to put one.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.400]   If they're struggling in life,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.160]   they'll be like, oh, let me just get in the gym,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.960]   work on my body, then I'll be happy after that.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.040]   And then they find, no, I got super fit
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.840]   and I'm still not all the way happy.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.000]   Or they'll try to fix just their diet
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.840]   and then they like, but like how do you,
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.040]   what do you need to put all of them together?
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.920]   - So when I was a young medical student,
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.640]   our dean drew four big circles on the board.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.240]   And he's like, never think of people as their diagnosis.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.440]   Always think of them in four big circles.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.920]   And this actually prevents burnout.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.840]   It's what's the biology?
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.800]   So that person that's unhappy that's going to the gym,
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.160]   that's a good thing.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.700]   But it's only a piece of it.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.300]   It's they're getting physically healthy.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.220]   So there's a biological circle.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.960]   There's also a psychological circle,
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.940]   which is how do you think?
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.980]   And what was your development like?
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.860]   People who grew up with a lot of trauma,
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.700]   it's hard for them to be happy
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.060]   because they're always watching
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.340]   for some bad thing to happen.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.820]   Because a lot of bad things happen.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.300]   So I call them ants, automatic negative thoughts
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.340]   that just come into your mind automatically
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.780]   and ruin your day.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.780]   I'll never be my best or whatever the negative thought is.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.980]   So learning how to kill the ants is what I talk about.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.220]   There's a social circle, which is how do we get along
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.540]   and what's going on in our society and our level of stress.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.420]   So being effective at living is really helpful.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.020]   Being effective in relationships.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.020]   And just one tip is if you notice what you like
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.620]   five times more than you notice what's wrong,
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.940]   your relationships are gonna be better.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.580]   So you notice in my office I have penguins.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.020]   There's a whole story around that.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.740]   And then there's a spiritual circle,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.780]   which is why do you care?
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.820]   What is your sense of meaning and purpose?
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.300]   Purposeful people live longer.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.180]   They're healthier.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.760]   They have a reason to do the right thing.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.300]   So for my patients, I'm like,
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.180]   so why do you wanna be better?
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.660]   How's your life gonna be better if your brain is better?
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.660]   - And as you go on this journey,
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.060]   you just gave me a lot of things that I could do
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.140]   to get better, but everyone has bad days.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.140]   And you show me the graph of there's this program
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.260]   that you put people on, but they have dips.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.740]   But if they stick with the program, they'll see change.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.220]   And if you scan your brain later, it'll be better.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.540]   But another part you brought up
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.460]   was how you deal with the bad days.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.820]   Like gives you data and you don't look at bad days
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.880]   as like, oh, I just have a bad day.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.860]   And I know a lot of people, me included,
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.060]   like I'll look at a bad day and then get guilty.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.180]   But those bad days can turn into multiple bad days.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.900]   But you were saying earlier how you turn it into data.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.700]   Okay, why was this a bad day?
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.540]   Like why did I make this choice that I didn't wanna make?
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.780]   So talk a little bit about that,
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.460]   'cause I think especially people that watch this
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.380]   and okay, I wanna make a change.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.580]   And then they try it for a while
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.060]   and then they have a few bad days.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.700]   It might turn into like a bad month or a bad year.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.540]   How do you--
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.820]   - And then they'll go to the doctor
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.860]   and end up with Lexapro or Adderall or sleeping pills, right?
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.900]   Because they didn't learn.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.180]   So there's a phrase I love.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.820]   Be curious, not furious.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.980]   So many people, they'll make a bad decision
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.660]   and then they'll hate themselves
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.380]   and then they'll continue to make the bad decisions.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.980]   So I have a patient, a good example is
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.780]   I have a patient that has an eating disorder.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.660]   She has bulimia and she's doing really well.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.480]   And then she came in and she was ashamed of herself
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.260]   because she relapsed.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.500]   And I'm like, curious, not furious.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.580]   Walk me through the day.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.180]   And she hadn't eaten anything.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.340]   And went out with her friends and had a drink
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.580]   and then a plate of nachos.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.420]   So she came into that vulnerable time,
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.380]   more vulnerable 'cause she had a super low blood sugar,
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.660]   'cause she hadn't eaten.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.540]   And then the alcohol lowered it further
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.740]   and then the nachos, she hated herself,
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.020]   made herself throw up.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.780]   I'm like, so yes, you can shame yourself if you want to,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.620]   it's just not helpful.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.860]   What happened?
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.340]   So what we need to do is eat during the day
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.500]   so that you have a healthy blood sugar
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.740]   so when they offer you the alcohol you can go, not for me.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.180]   And we just learn.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.300]   And it's like someone's struggling with an addiction.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.060]   You don't shame them with a relapse
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.060]   is you go, what happened?
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.100]   What's the goal?
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.020]   And what can we learn from it?
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.020]   So that you can be what you want.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:35.860]   And that's what I want.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.740]   I want people to be clear with what they want
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.940]   and then just go, is my behavior getting me what I want?
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.140]   - But you gotta be open too.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.260]   Like you can't just relapse and then feel ashamed
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.100]   and keep it all inside.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.260]   You gotta like have people in your life
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.700]   that you can tell, be all the way open.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.020]   No, like I relapsed there.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.660]   Even if I relapsed seven days in a row.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.060]   Like you gotta have people in your circle
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.020]   that you can talk to.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:01.860]   How important is--
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.940]   - And nobody's perfect, which is why Jesus died on the cross.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.340]   - Exactly.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:11.980]   How important is having people to be all the way healthy,
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.540]   having people you can talk to
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.460]   about when you're having those bad days?
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.180]   - Yeah, people are contagious.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.380]   So you have to be careful who you surround yourself with.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.740]   So choose wisely.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.900]   They're as contagious as COVID.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:31.460]   But you wanna nurture your circle.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.060]   So be careful with who you pick.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.180]   But then you wanna nurture it.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.500]   So important.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.020]   'Cause we're connected as a species, right?
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.420]   Polar bears, they're good at being by themselves, right?
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.100]   Unless they're making a baby polar bear,
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.500]   they don't need anybody
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.220]   because that's not how they were made.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.740]   We were made in connection.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.900]   And it's essential.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.140]   - I just got a couple more questions for you, my guy.
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.140]   So if you had three things to avoid
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.660]   and three things to do for everyone,
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.340]   what would be the top three things
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.420]   that you would pick for both?
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.860]   - Three things to avoid.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.820]   I have a new book called "Your Brain is Always Listening."
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.780]   And I would avoid the oblivious bad habit dragon.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.140]   That's the first thing I'd do.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.820]   I mean, I get conscious about loving my brain.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.420]   Too many people, they're just oblivious
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.060]   that whether it's the air they breathe
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.740]   or the water they drink or the food they eat
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.380]   or the thoughts they think,
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.740]   there's just, they have no control.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.100]   And so I'd get rid of being oblivious.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:53.060]   And then I'd be intentional about food
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.500]   'cause food is so important.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:00.500]   I think 30% of the mental health problems in America
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.340]   are due to the standard American diet,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.420]   which spells sad, standard American diet.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.460]   It's pro-inflammatory.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.140]   Happy meals are not happy.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.700]   They're sad meals.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.740]   When you think about it, it's like, no.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.100]   And I turn off the gadgets and move.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:22.180]   That the gadgets are causing us to be more sedentary,
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.460]   more overweight.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.740]   - Totally agree.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.700]   - So for do, it's purposeful.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.580]   Love your brain and move and eat.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.380]   - Gotcha.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.140]   Was that three dos or was that three don'ts?
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.940]   - Well, love your brain, move, eat, right.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.940]   And avoid the oblivious bad habit dragon.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.860]   And watch the digital addiction
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.180]   and the standard American diet.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.500]   - Gotcha.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.340]   Last question.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.380]   - But it comes down to this one question.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.340]   I worked with B.J. Fogg at Stanford for six months.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.780]   He created something called tiny habits.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.820]   What's the smallest thing I can do today
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.820]   that'll make the biggest difference?
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.940]   And we have 50 tiny habits.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.140]   But the mother tiny habit is just ask yourself
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.980]   as you go through your day,
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.340]   is this good for my brain or bad for it?
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.180]   And if you can answer that with information and love,
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.260]   love of yourself, love of your mission,
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.780]   why you're on the planet, love of your family and friends,
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.420]   begin making better decisions.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.180]   - Right, no doubt.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.020]   My last question for you is obviously
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.780]   you've already made such a huge difference in the world.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.860]   A lot of celebrities who have been addicted,
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.620]   all this stuff, you've helped heal them.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:52.180]   What is your overall goal and what you wanna do
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.100]   and where do you see the world?
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.580]   What's your main goal for the world?
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.140]   - So it's gonna sound crazy,
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.100]   but I wanna stand mental illness.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.100]   I hate the term mental illness.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.060]   It shames people, it's stigmatizing, and it's wrong.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.380]   These are brain health issues.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.820]   Call someone mental, you shame them.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.500]   Call someone brain, you elevate them.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   So I wanna end mental illness
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:25.500]   by creating a revolution in brain health.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.580]   And what I wanna do with my influencers
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.220]   is I want you to help me figure out
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.620]   how to make brain health cool.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.460]   - No doubt.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.100]   - And so for me to take an NBA player
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.060]   that is masterful at his craft and go,
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.180]   "Yeah, let's make brain health cool."
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.340]   A lot of people pay attention to that.
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.180]   - No doubt.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.300]   Well, I think you can do it because I know,
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.460]   I mean, the world's already moving
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.180]   in more of a health conscious state.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.700]   The brain is a little ignored,
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.700]   but I think you got it going on
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.100]   and I see it firsthand, the benefits.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.340]   You know, I thought everything was cool in my brain.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.220]   I did a brain scan and then I kinda told you
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.700]   about my issues beforehand and my brain
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.300]   showed the things that I was,
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.100]   and it's just, it's cool to look at it from that angle
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.940]   and I think it's super important.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.060]   I think you can do it.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.420]   - Well, let's make your brain the best it can be.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.540]   - Let's do it.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.700]   That's a wrap though.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.020]   Another episode of Kids, Mike.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.860]   Appreciate it.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.780]   (electronic music)
