[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.020]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.860]   >> Here with another episode of Curious Mike,
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.340]   I'm sitting here with Dr. Amen.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.380]   Appreciate you being on the podcast my bro.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.760]   >> Thank you so much.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.520]   >> Yeah. So we just got done,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.940]   I just got done with my brain scan.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.760]   I've been wanting to do something like this for a while,
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.320]   but you actually, you worked in the army for 10 years,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.480]   and then you were helping on the medic side.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.380]   So you've always wanted to help get people better.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.000]   How did you get into the more this side of it,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.320]   looking at people's brains and helping
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.320]   people get better from that standpoint?
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.960]   >> So when I was an infantry medic,
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.880]   about a year into doing that,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.440]   I realized I didn't like being shot at,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.480]   that it wasn't for me.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.000]   Some people like it,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840]   and I got retrained as an x-ray technician,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840]   and developed a passion for medical imaging.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.320]   As our professors used to say,
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.280]   how do you know unless you look?
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.440]   And then I got out of the army,
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.760]   went to medical school,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.640]   and when I was a second year medical student,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.320]   someone I loved tried to kill herself.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.400]   And I took her to see a wonderful psychiatrist,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.440]   and I came to realize if he helped her,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.840]   it wouldn't just help her.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840]   That ultimately it would help her children,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.200]   and her grandchildren.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.040]   So I fell in love with psychiatry,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.200]   because I realized it can change generations of people.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.080]   But I fell in love with the only medical specialty
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.680]   that never looks at the organ it treats.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.080]   Most people go, I'm depressed,
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.440]   and they get medicine,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.040]   with nobody looking at their brain.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.840]   And I'm like, that's insane.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.860]   So we started looking at the brain about 30 years ago,
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.200]   and it's been so exciting.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.920]   Because what I learned is depression's not one thing.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.960]   Or having ADD, it's not one thing.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.520]   Or people who are anxious,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.360]   sometimes it's from a head injury,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.600]   or sometimes it's from toxic exposure,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.800]   or sometimes it's because no one knows
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.560]   how to manage their mind.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.080]   But if you don't look, you don't know.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   - Right.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.360]   - And so I have, and then I realized,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.240]   well, your brain's an organ like your heart's an organ,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.200]   so you gotta keep that healthy,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.800]   or you're more vulnerable to not being your best.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.560]   - Right, and we went through kind of my stuff.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.100]   Self-control was an area I wanted to get better at.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.720]   But like a lot of people, like you said,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.000]   deal with depression, anxiety,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.800]   making poor decisions, whatever it is.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.760]   And you get judged for what you do,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.240]   and a lot of people just will tell you,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.280]   especially, you know, we're both men of faith.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.960]   Like the church a lot of times will judge people,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.520]   or say, you know, just don't do this.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.920]   But you're saying there's a deeper issue,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.160]   and it can stem from a head injury,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.660]   it can stem from toxins in your body,
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.480]   all this stuff that could be affecting your brain.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.400]   So you're looking at it
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.560]   from a completely different standpoint,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.600]   and saying no, like, when your brain gets more healthy,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.520]   you'll be able to go out and live better,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.720]   and do the things you wanna do more effectively.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.120]   - And what roadblocks do you think you have?
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.560]   What do you think could be better?
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.080]   - I think, I was just talking to them about this,
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.780]   but I think I'm very disciplined in some areas,
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.920]   but then in other areas,
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.200]   like when it comes to my workouts, and my health,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.520]   and all this different stuff, I'm very disciplined.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.600]   But then other areas, I'm sometimes not consistent,
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.040]   and then that plays a toll on my mental,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.160]   because I feel like a lot of it is your systems,
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   like getting on a schedule, and then maintaining it,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.000]   and consistently making the right choices.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.680]   And then, obviously, you're more mentally there.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.640]   When you're making mistakes, or things you don't wanna do,
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.240]   then it can take a toll on your mental, I feel like.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.440]   So I feel like some of those things, for me,
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.760]   that's something I wanna improve on,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.320]   like consistency off the court.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.560]   - Consistency as far as the decisions you make?
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.380]   - Decisions.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.980]   - What you eat, or what you drink, or?
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.120]   - Nothing, nothing at all with health,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.280]   or what I put in my body, or things like that,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.320]   but more like, you know, consistency,
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.440]   practicing my faith, like getting into my Bible every day,
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.240]   or consistency, you know, hanging around the right girls,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   things like that, for me, are kinda like a hindrance at times.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.240]   Like, I don't feel like I have an addictive personality
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.360]   as far as, you know, drugs, or alcohol,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   but some of the other stuff, like,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.480]   I just have a certain pull towards it
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.840]   that I wish wasn't there, you know what I mean?
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.920]   - And so, if you had a bit better self-control,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.760]   that would help.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.800]   - Yeah, that'd definitely help.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.440]   - Ever have a concussion, or a head injury?
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.560]   - I didn't have a concussion.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.480]   Never had a concussion, I don't think,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.740]   but I hit a car with my head.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.000]   I don't know if you can see that scar right there,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.760]   the little scar right there.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.680]   Yeah, this was when I was young, young,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.720]   probably 12 or 13-ish.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   10, nine, 10, probably nine or 10,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.960]   and I'm riding with my friend on a bike,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.780]   and I'm looking back at him, and his mom was with us,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.200]   and his mom was like, "Michael, look,"
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.740]   so I turn, and a parked car is right there,
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.240]   and I hit it with my head right here,
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.080]   and I flip over the car.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.600]   Ended up going to the-- - Oh, that's a big deal.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.680]   - Yeah, ended up going to the emergency room and everything.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.540]   Just had stitches.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.960]   I don't know how severe it was,
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.040]   but I definitely hit my head.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.280]   That's the only major head trauma that I've had, though.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.520]   - You have a scar here.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.960]   What's that from, the other side?
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   - Right here?
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.080]   - No, in your eyebrow.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.920]   - Oh, right here?
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.020]   That's just swag.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.480]   - Oh, that's purposeful.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.640]   - That's swag, yeah.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.900]   That's just swag.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.580]   - Your brain controls everything you do,
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.040]   how you think, how you feel, how you act,
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.420]   how you get along with other people.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.260]   It's the organ of intelligence, character,
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260]   and every decision you make,
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.460]   and when your brain works right, you work right,
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.020]   and when your brain is troubled for whatever reason,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.420]   you have more trouble in your life,
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.220]   and it's easy to judge people.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.680]   It's harder to go, "Why?"
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.140]   - No doubt.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.980]   And I know, even for me,
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.220]   doing this whole session right now was so,
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.180]   it almost lifts a weight off your shoulders,
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.700]   'cause you realize, no, not everything is your fault.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.580]   You could've gone through some trauma
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.100]   or something that caused you to be the way you are,
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.540]   but like you showed me,
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.100]   there's a way to reverse some of this stuff,
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.220]   and there's a way to heal, and things like that.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.940]   So for me, looking at my brain and everything,
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.020]   what did you see was my kind of issues
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.100]   and how I can get better?
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.460]   - Okay, moment of truth.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.060]   - Let's do it.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.740]   - So we did a study called SPECT,
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.140]   and SPECT looks at blood flow and activity.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.660]   It looks at how your brain works,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.300]   and it basically shows us three things.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.280]   Good activity, you have a lot.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.300]   Too little activity, there's something going on
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.660]   we have to talk about.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.540]   And too much, and that's not the issue.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.900]   So here's an example of a healthy scan.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.260]   We're gonna look at it in two ways.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.580]   This looks at the outside surface,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.780]   and it should be full, even, and symmetrical.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.220]   So this view, we're looking underneath the brain.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.780]   Top is the front part of the brain, bottom is the back.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.260]   This is your cerebellum, which I would expect
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.720]   in an NBA player to just be great.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.860]   Here, blue is average activity.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.900]   Red and white are the most active parts of the brain,
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.820]   which should be back here.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.820]   This is the cerebellum, and then the visual cortex here.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.140]   When we look at your scan, I don't like it so much.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.540]   It's low in activity.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.580]   And is that from trauma?
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.620]   I think part of it, 'cause I can actually see
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.900]   here in the back, your head got whacked.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.380]   And as you described it, you're going on a bike
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.500]   and you're turned this way, and someone says,
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.340]   "Hey, Michael," and you go here, boom, and then you flip.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.220]   That's a lot of force.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.220]   Your brain is the consistency of soft butter, tofu, custard,
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.780]   somewhere between egg whites and jello.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.780]   And if you look inside a skull, it has sharp, bony ridges.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.040]   So I've asked God many times,
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.500]   "Why haven't you put bumper guards?"
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.740]   He goes, "Who knew they would play football?"
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.340]   But it got whacked at some point.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.620]   So if I can make this better,
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.300]   and I'm gonna show you how to do that,
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.720]   you're gonna have more mental horsepower.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.860]   And when you go, "I want to make this decision,"
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.900]   you'll be more likely to follow through.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:13.040]   But we need to fix this, 'cause five years from now,
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.940]   let's say you didn't care about your health,
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.300]   and you went out drinking and not sleeping,
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.040]   and some of the things you see other NBA players do,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.740]   you won't make good decisions,
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.460]   which means you won't last as long, right?
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.320]   Now, here, blue is average activity.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.460]   Your cerebellum is awesome, it's healthy.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.860]   I like that.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.180]   Emotional brain's up a little bit.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.580]   I'm not concerned about this.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.240]   If I fix this, you will love me forever.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.220]   - So there's supposed to be no holes?
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.680]   - Supposed to be no holes.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.980]   With the holes, and you don't have holes in your brain.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.540]   How I make these pictures is I tell the computer
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.500]   I want to see a certain level of activity.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.500]   Anything below it shows up as a hole or a dent.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.380]   But what it means is your brain isn't healthy,
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.800]   and we need to fix it.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.920]   If I get you a healthy brain,
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.680]   you'll have the best season you've ever had.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.640]   'Cause it's about consistency, and decision-making,
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.440]   and mental energy, right?
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.480]   And with blood flow, caffeine decreases blood flow,
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.360]   so I'd limit it.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.780]   - Everybody wanna say caffeine's good for 'em.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.660]   - Yeah, it's not.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.460]   - I knew it.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.700]   - Nicotine, not good.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.540]   Do you vape?
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.300]   - I don't.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.620]   - Good, don't.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.460]   So, for probably a couple of different reasons,
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.700]   when you were eight or nine,
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.540]   your head hit another car, right, in a bike accident.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.100]   That mattered, I mean, I can still see evidence of that.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.600]   You've had heavy metals in your body,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.020]   and you had general anesthesia.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.240]   All of that led to lower blood flow.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.560]   And the cool thing is we're gonna reverse that,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.320]   but it'll make you struggle more.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.040]   And you don't want to, right?
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.640]   'Cause you and I both never wanna be normal.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.320]   We wanna be optimal.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.360]   And in order to be optimal,
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.920]   the computer has to work right, right?
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.800]   So, I almost think of it like hardware and software.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.860]   If we get the physical function of your brain
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.600]   as healthy as it can be,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.020]   you can then be the best you can be.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.140]   - Gotcha.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.000]   So, like I've heard it all the time,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.080]   like around 25, your brain stops.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.480]   Like you're fully developed.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.880]   But you show me some brain scans of people who are 55,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.500]   and then you scan 'em again at 65,
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.440]   and their brain is more healthy.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.680]   So, where does that come from?
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.240]   And what stops happening at 25?
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.320]   And then like, what is there you can do after that?
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.480]   - So, for girls, their brains
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.240]   are pretty much fully developed at 25.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.920]   For boys, we're always behind.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.040]   It's more like 27 or 28.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.720]   So, there's this process in the brain called myelinization,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.040]   where nerve cells get wrapped
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.640]   with a white fatty substance called myelin.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.240]   And when they get wrapped, they become more efficient.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.400]   They work like 100 times faster.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.680]   And myelin starts to be deposited in little kids
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.120]   at two months in their visual cortex in the back,
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.840]   and then slowly, about 25,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.040]   finishes myelinating their frontal lobes.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.840]   And that's why early drug abuse is a disaster,
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.240]   because it stops that beautiful developmental process
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.880]   that's what maturity is about, right?
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.640]   Maturity is you just don't make the same stupid mistakes
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.920]   you made before, right?
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.400]   You're learning.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.100]   But if the organ of decision-making isn't healthy,
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:06.100]   it's not properly developed, that's a problem for you.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.460]   Now, we have a lot of experience
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.720]   of taking brains that are troubled and making them better.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   And so, every day, your brain is becoming better or worse
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.160]   depending on how you slept, what you ate,
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.880]   the nutrients you took, the amount of stress you're under.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.960]   I was on TV yesterday, it was just terrible.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.040]   A new study came out.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.680]   Depression in children doubled during the pandemic
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.880]   because of the isolation, the fear, the social unrest,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.600]   the political divide.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.760]   And it's just horrifying.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.920]   We need to teach children to love their brains,
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.040]   take care of it, and then discipline their minds, right?
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.760]   People think of physical discipline.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.520]   You're a professional athlete.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.160]   It's not something you do once.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.320]   It's something you do over and over and over again
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.640]   so you can maintain a high level of performance.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.920]   Well, mental discipline's the same way.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.060]   We have to do that over and over and over
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.400]   so we can maintain a high level of mental performance.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.700]   - That makes sense.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.560]   And you just, I actually was gonna get into this,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.520]   but you're saying, you said before COVID and after COVID,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.160]   you've seen a big difference in,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.920]   especially young people's brain, but general population,
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.720]   it's a big difference that you've seen?
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.880]   - Big difference, in part because of the stress.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.080]   And we also talked about COVID.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.600]   And COVID can activate the emotional centers of the brain
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.440]   and put people at higher risk for emotional issues.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.560]   - That makes sense.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.160]   So obviously not everybody has the money or the time
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.040]   to come scan their brain, although everyone should.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.980]   So what's like, for the majority of brains you saw,
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.480]   especially for young people, then we'll go to old people,
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.120]   what are some practical things everyone can do
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.640]   to keep their brain as healthy as possible
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.840]   without even scanning it?
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.160]   Like what's some day-to-day things?
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.720]   - Well, I mean, the first thing is to love your brain.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.780]   And nobody loves their brain.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.620]   Why?
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.960]   Because you can't see it.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.520]   You can see the wrinkles in your skin
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.200]   or the fat around your belly,
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.160]   and you can do something when you're unhappy with it.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.000]   But because most people never look, they don't care.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.260]   When I looked at my brain first time in 1991,
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.620]   I was the top neuroscience student in medical school.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.400]   I'm a double board certified psychiatrist,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.640]   and I didn't care at all about my brain.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.440]   And then when I saw it and it wasn't healthy,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.340]   'cause I played football in high school, I had bad habits,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.480]   I'm like, "No, I have to care about this."
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.640]   And then I've spent the last 30 years making it better.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.480]   So one, you have to care about it.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.080]   That's the first thing.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.000]   And then avoid things that hurt it.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.880]   You just have to know the list.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.800]   I went to my daughter's second grade class
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.760]   and I put 20 things on the board.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.240]   And I go, "Okay, you tell me,
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.440]   "good for your brain or bad for it?"
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.920]   Football, everybody put bad for it.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.800]   Hitting soccer balls with their head, bad.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.120]   Smoking, bad.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.160]   Marijuana, bad.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.120]   Even the second graders know it, right?
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.320]   I mean, there's this whole discussion in society,
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.160]   but second graders know it's not good for your brain.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.420]   Alcohol, bad.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.820]   Ice cream, they love it, but bad.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:28.880]   The only thing they missed was orange juice,
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.520]   which they put in the good category,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.220]   but it's way too much sugar.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.800]   Whenever, eating the sugar from six oranges,
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.520]   how does that make any sense?
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.880]   Eat the orange, don't drink the juice.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.240]   - Eat the orange, don't drink the juice.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.200]   I actually, that's surprising to me
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.800]   'cause I'm someone that eats a lot of fruits and vegetables
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.480]   and I was always told the sugar between the two
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   are a lot different, so I thought that oranges
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.520]   would actually be good for your brain, like oranges.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.640]   - Oranges are good for your brain, not the juice.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:05.520]   So whenever you unwrap sugar from its fiber source,
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.600]   it turns toxic in your body.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.360]   So fructose can actually give you fatty liver.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.800]   It's really interesting.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.920]   There's a wonderful YouTube video called
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.680]   Sugar, The Bitter Truth by Robert Lustig.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.920]   If you watch that, you'll never drink fruit juice again.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.760]   - That's crazy.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.120]   Yeah, I came in here knowing that some things
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.620]   were toxic for your brain, obviously like alcohol
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.480]   or getting hit in the head that's bad for you
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.520]   or going to McDonald's every day.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.480]   Certain foods are bad for you.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.240]   But there's like a big debate going on,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.640]   especially now, like all these places
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.480]   have legalized marijuana and are saying,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.160]   all these studies are coming out saying
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.720]   it could be beneficial for you 'cause of this or that.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.680]   But you look at the brains, like all these people
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.920]   that are making these assumptions about what it does,
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.480]   they're not looking at what it does to your brain
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.640]   and you've done extensive research
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.440]   and you're saying like no, marijuana's definitely
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.160]   a negative for your brain.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.600]   - So, when I first started scanning people,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.040]   I would see people who were using marijuana,
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.720]   their brain looked toxic.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.940]   It looked older than they were.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.860]   And now, is it bad in every situation all the time?
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.700]   No.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.740]   For my father-in-law who had cancer,
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:28.120]   and it was terminal, it helped him eat.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   That was good.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.920]   Some people with resistant seizures
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.360]   seems to be helpful.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.480]   But to just say it's innocuous is a lie.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   I published a study on 62,000 scans
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.960]   on how the brain ages.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.720]   It's the largest imaging study ever.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.400]   And then we looked at, well, what accelerates aging?
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.080]   And having schizophrenia was the worst.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.280]   Your brain looked 10 years older.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.360]   Marijuana was the second worst.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.560]   It surprised me.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.040]   It ages the brain.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.840]   And I don't know about you, but I want a young brain.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.760]   I don't want an older brain.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.160]   And Miley Cyrus is one of my patients.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.080]   And that came out public last year.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.020]   And I love her.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.760]   But I couldn't get her to stop smoking pot
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.320]   for the longest time.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.000]   It's not good for you.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.680]   And then I figured out the secret.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.240]   There's a part of your brain called the hippocampus.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.880]   It's on the inside of your temporal lobes.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.320]   And the hippocampus is Greek for seahorse.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.000]   And every day, it's one of the few areas of your brain
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.360]   that produces stem cells.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.180]   So it actually makes new cells every day,
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.600]   like 700 new cells every day.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.760]   And I was telling her, it's like your brain
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.640]   is making 700 new baby seahorses.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.720]   And her eyes got big 'cause she knew what I was doing.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.840]   And she's an animal lover.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.040]   She said, "Dr. Raymond, it's so unfair."
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.360]   I said, "You're murdering the seahorses."
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.200]   Right?
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.480]   If you wanna grow your brain, you can grow your brain.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.840]   You have to put it in a healing environment.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.080]   And the problem with marijuana, it's fat-soluble.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.280]   What that means is if you smoke today
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   or you do an edible today, we can measure it for 30 days.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.360]   So it's like you make this one decision today,
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.840]   you're sort of making this decision for a month.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.720]   - That's a good point.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.080]   I asked you this earlier, but I was like, okay.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.600]   So say you're not an alcoholic or you don't drink a ton,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.680]   but you do certain things and you say,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   oh, it's just a balance.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.000]   Like I'm gonna be good most of the time,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.400]   but then I'm gonna make certain decisions
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.720]   like once in a while.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.940]   Or I'm gonna eat bad once in a while.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.000]   Like, or smoke once in a while.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.240]   But some of these things like they,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.800]   even though you do them once in a while or as a balance,
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.120]   they have like lasting impacts on your brain.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.040]   And we talked earlier about, you know,
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.480]   is it helping heal my brain or take away from it?
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.880]   Or like, what's the consequences of doing these things?
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.520]   And I thought that that was pretty interesting
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.120]   'cause I know a lot of people, especially young people,
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.920]   like they'll justify making certain decisions
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.620]   'cause they've been doing good for a while.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.300]   Now they just wanna wild out for a night, whatever it is.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.680]   But it has lasting impacts for your brain.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.580]   - Well, and there's the little lies that,
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.920]   I would call them the little lies
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.980]   that make people fat, depressed, and feeble-minded.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.440]   And one of the little lies is everything in moderation.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.020]   Everything in moderation is the gateway thought to hell.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.380]   Because it's like, well, I'll cheat this,
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.660]   and then I'll do that.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.860]   And then I'll, and I'm like, it's my brain.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.100]   I don't wanna be in moderation.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.620]   I want to love my brain.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.920]   And actually doing the right thing
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.980]   is never about deprivation.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.420]   So Drew Carey, the famous comedian,
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.060]   he lost a lot of weight and he kept it off.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.340]   And there's this quote that I knew he would keep it off.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.340]   He said, "Eating crappy food isn't a reward.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.020]   "It's a punishment."
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.280]   Because he knew what it did to his body.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.220]   And so when you go, I wanna reward myself,
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.860]   it's like, well, it's something that you love
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.700]   that loves you back.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.260]   That if I ever open up a restaurant,
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.220]   I wanna call it Loves You Back
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.540]   because I love the shake I have in the morning.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.620]   I generally love a big salad with protein on it,
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.500]   with veggies, and I love that stuff.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.940]   I pick things I love.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.060]   Like I make a brain-healthy hot chocolate every night,
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.180]   raw cacao, unsweetened organic,
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.180]   vanilla almond milk, a little chocolate stevia in it.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.740]   It tastes great.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.100]   I love it.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.180]   And cacao's a superfood.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.620]   I love it back.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.980]   It loves me back.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.380]   - There's plenty of good things you can find,
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.300]   especially nowadays.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.140]   People are becoming more health conscious
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.140]   than they used to be.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.900]   There's so many good restaurants that have healthy food.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.920]   My next question is, you see,
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.140]   like what are the biggest outwardly things
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.580]   that people struggle with or that they do
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.420]   in a bad brain that you see versus like a very healthy brain?
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.540]   What is the outward difference in how they live,
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.300]   their mood, like all those things?
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.560]   What's the biggest few outwardly things?
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.920]   - Well, with a healthy brain, you're a better friend.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.020]   You don't interrupt as much.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.220]   You listen.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.900]   You care about what's going on with the other person.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.380]   You're better at managing your money.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.020]   You're more thoughtful.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:59.900]   People sort of like you more because you're consistent,
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.260]   reliable, reasonably on time.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.820]   The things that sort of make life work
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.600]   come with a healthier brain.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.820]   A lot of people these days,
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:18.540]   they try to separate like science and faith.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.140]   And one thing we talked about earlier
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.980]   was how you take mind, body, spirit,
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.780]   all these different things and you put them all into one.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.500]   How do you kind of do that?
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.340]   Like how do they all come together?
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.900]   And you were saying earlier like your brain helps you
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.260]   even with your relationship with God
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.100]   or how you hear him or how you can be effective for him
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.260]   in your purpose, how do you put all those things together?
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.220]   'Cause a lot of people will try to put one.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.700]   If they're struggling in life, they'll be like,
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.900]   oh, let me just get in the gym, work on my body,
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.940]   then I'll be happy after that.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.020]   And then they find, no, I got super fit
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.820]   and I'm still not all the way happy.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.020]   Or they'll try to fix just their diet
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.860]   and then they like, but like how do you,
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.020]   what do you need to put all of them together?
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.900]   - So when I was a young medical student,
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.660]   our dean drew four big circles on the board
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.260]   and he's like, never think of people as their diagnosis.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.460]   Always think of them in four big circles.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.940]   And this actually prevents burnout.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.860]   It's what's the biology?
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.820]   So that person that's unhappy that's going to the gym,
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.700]   that's a good thing, but it's only a piece of it.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.300]   It's they're getting physically healthy.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.220]   So there's a biological circle.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.980]   There's also a psychological circle,
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.940]   which is how do you think?
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.980]   And what was your development like?
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.860]   People who grew up with a lot of trauma,
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.700]   it's hard for them to be happy
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.060]   because they're always watching
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.340]   for some bad thing to happen
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.820]   because a lot of bad things happen.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.300]   So I call them ants, automatic negative thoughts
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.340]   that just come into your mind automatically
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.780]   and ruin your day.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.780]   I'll never be my best or whatever the negative thought is.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.980]   So learning how to kill the ants is what I talk about.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.220]   There's a social circle, which is how do we get along
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.540]   and what's going on in our society and our level of stress.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.420]   So being effective at living is really helpful.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.380]   Being effective in relationships and just one tip
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.100]   is if you notice what you like five times more
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.620]   than you notice what's wrong,
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.940]   your relationships are going to be better.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.580]   So you notice in my office I have penguins.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.020]   There's a whole story around that.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.740]   And then there's the spiritual circle,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.780]   which is why do you care?
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.820]   What is your sense of meaning and purpose?
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.300]   Purposeful people live longer.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.180]   They're healthier.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.760]   They have a reason to do the right thing.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.300]   So for my patients, I'm like,
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.180]   so why do you want to be better?
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.660]   How's your life going to be better if your brain is better?
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.500]   - And as you go on this journey,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.840]   like you just gave me a lot of things
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.660]   that I could do to get better,
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:07.660]   but everyone has bad days and like you showed me the graph
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.980]   of there's this program that you put people on,
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.260]   but they have dips.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.740]   But if they stick with the program, they'll see change.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.220]   And if you scan your brain later, it'll be better.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.540]   But another part you brought up
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.460]   was how you deal with the bad days.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.820]   Like gives you data and you don't look at bad days
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.900]   as like, oh, I just have a bad day.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.860]   And I know a lot of people, me included,
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.060]   like I'll look at a bad day and then get guilty.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.180]   But those bad days can turn into multiple bad days.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.900]   But you were saying earlier how you turn it into data.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.700]   Okay, why was this a bad day?
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.580]   Like why did I make this choice that I didn't want to make?
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.780]   So talk a little bit about that,
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.460]   'cause I think especially people that watch this
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.360]   and okay, I want to make a change.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.580]   And then they try it for a while
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.060]   and then they have a few bad days.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.700]   It might turn into like a bad month or a bad year.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.540]   How do you--
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.820]   - And then they'll go to the doctor
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.820]   and end up with Lexapro or Adderall or sleeping pills.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.900]   Right, because they didn't learn.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.140]   So there's a phrase I love.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.800]   Be curious, not furious.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.960]   So, so many people that make a bad decision
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.660]   and then they'll hate themselves
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.340]   and then they'll continue to make the bad decisions.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.940]   So I have a patient, a good example is,
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.740]   I have a patient that has an eating disorder.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.680]   She has bulimia.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.620]   And she's doing really well.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.440]   And then she came in and she was ashamed of herself
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.220]   because she relapsed.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.460]   And I'm like, curious, not furious.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.540]   Walk me through the day.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.140]   And she hadn't eaten anything.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.300]   And went out with her friends and had a drink
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.540]   and then a plate of nachos.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:51.380]   So she came into that vulnerable time,
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.340]   more vulnerable 'cause she had a super low blood sugar,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.620]   'cause she hadn't eaten.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.540]   And then the alcohol lowered it further
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.740]   and then the nachos, she hated herself,
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.020]   made herself throw up.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.780]   I'm like, so yes, you can shame yourself if you want to,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.620]   it's just not helpful.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.860]   What happened?
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.340]   So what we need to do is eat during the day
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.500]   so that you have a healthy blood sugar
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.740]   so when they offer you the alcohol you can go, not for me.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.180]   And we just learn.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.300]   And it's like someone struggling with an addiction.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.060]   You don't shame them with a relapse,
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.060]   is you go, what happened?
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.100]   What's the goal?
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.020]   And what can we learn from it?
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.980]   So that you can be what you want.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.860]   And that's what I want.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.740]   I want people to be clear with what they want
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.940]   and then just go, is my behavior getting me what I want?
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.340]   - But you gotta be open too.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.260]   You can't just relapse and then feel ashamed
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.100]   and keep it all inside.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.260]   You gotta have people in your life
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.700]   that you can tell, be all the way open.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.020]   No, I relapsed today.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.820]   Even if I relapsed seven days in a row,
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.100]   you gotta have people in your circle
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.060]   that you can talk to.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.900]   How important is--
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.900]   - And nobody's perfect,
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.980]   which is why Jesus died on the cross.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.540]   (laughing)
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.380]   - Exactly.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.980]   How important is having people to be all the way healthy,
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.580]   having people you can talk to
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.500]   about when you're having those bad days?
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.220]   - Yeah, people are contagious.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.420]   So you have to be careful who you surround yourself with.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.780]   So choose wisely.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.940]   They're as contagious as COVID.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:31.460]   But you wanna nurture your circle.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.060]   So be careful with who you pick.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.180]   But then you wanna nurture it.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.500]   So important.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.020]   'Cause we're connected as a species, right?
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.420]   Polar bears, they're good at being by themselves, right?
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.100]   Unless they're making a baby polar bear,
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.500]   they don't need anybody
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.220]   because that's not how they were made.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.740]   We were made in connection.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.900]   And it's essential.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.140]   - I just got a couple more questions for you, my guy.
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.140]   So if you had three things to avoid
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.660]   and three things to do for everyone,
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.340]   what would be the top three things
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.420]   that you would pick for both?
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.860]   - Three things to avoid.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.820]   I have a new book called "Your Brain is Always Listening."
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.740]   And I would avoid the oblivious bad habit dragon.
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.100]   It's the first thing I'd do.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.780]   I mean, I get conscious about loving my brain.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.380]   Too many people are just, they're just oblivious
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.020]   that whether it's the air they breathe
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.700]   or the water they drink or the food they eat
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.300]   or the thoughts they think,
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.700]   there's just, they have no control.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.060]   And so I'd get rid of being oblivious.
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.980]   And then I'd be intentional about food
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.460]   'cause food is so important.
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.460]   I think 30% of the mental health problems in America
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.300]   are due to the standard American diet,
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.360]   which spells sad, standard American diet.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.420]   It's pro-inflammatory.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.100]   Happy meals are not happy.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.660]   They're sad meals.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.660]   When you think about it, it's like, no.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.060]   And I'd turn off the gadgets and move.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.140]   The gadgets are causing us to be more sedentary,
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.420]   more overweight.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.700]   - Totally agree.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.700]   - So for do, it's purposeful, love your brain
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.500]   and move and eat.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.300]   - Gotcha.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.060]   Is that three dos or is that three don'ts?
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.860]   - Well, love your brain, move, eat, right.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.860]   And avoid the oblivious bad habit dragon
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.860]   and watch the digital addiction
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.140]   and the standard American diet.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.460]   - Gotcha.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.300]   Last question.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.380]   - But it comes down to this one question.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.300]   I worked with B.J. Fogg at Stanford for six months.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.780]   He created something called tiny habits.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.780]   What's the smallest thing I can do today
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.820]   that'll make the biggest difference?
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.940]   And we have 50 tiny habits.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.140]   But the mother tiny habit is just ask yourself
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.980]   as you go through your day.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.340]   Is this good for my brain or bad for it?
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.180]   And if you can answer that with information and love,
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.260]   love of yourself, love of your mission,
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.780]   why you're on the planet, love of your family and friends,
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.420]   begin making better decisions.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.180]   - Right, no doubt.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.020]   My last question for you is obviously
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.780]   you've already made such a huge difference in the world.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.860]   A lot of celebrities who have been addicted,
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.660]   all this stuff, you've helped heal them.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.180]   What is your overall goal and what you wanna do
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.300]   and where do you see the world?
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.580]   What's your main goal for the world?
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.140]   - So, it's gonna sound crazy,
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.100]   but I wanna stand mental illness.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.100]   I hate the term mental illness.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.060]   It shames people, it's stigmatizing, and it's wrong.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.380]   These are brain health issues.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.780]   Call someone mental, you shame them.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.460]   Call someone brain, you elevate them.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.500]   So, I wanna end mental illness
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:25.500]   by creating a revolution in brain health.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.580]   And what I wanna do with my influencers
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.220]   is I want you to help me figure out
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.620]   how to make brain health cool.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.460]   - No doubt.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.100]   - And so, for me to take an NBA player
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.100]   that is masterful at his craft and go,
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.140]   yeah, let's make brain health cool.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.300]   A lot of people pay attention to that.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.140]   - No doubt.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.260]   Well, I think you can do it because I know,
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.420]   I mean, the world's already moving
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.140]   in more of a health conscious state.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.660]   The brain is a little ignored,
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.660]   but I think, you know, you got it going on
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.060]   and I see it firsthand, the benefits.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.300]   You know, I thought everything was cool in my brain.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.180]   I did a brain scan and then I kinda told you
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.940]   about my issues beforehand.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.260]   And my brain showed the things that I was,
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.060]   and it's just, it's cool to look at it from that angle.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.580]   And I think it's super important.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.940]   So, I think you can do it.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.300]   - Well, let's make your brain the best it can be.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.500]   - Let's do it.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.700]   That's a wrap though.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.020]   Another episode of Kids, Mike.
