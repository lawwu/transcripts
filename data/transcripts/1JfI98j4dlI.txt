[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   [silence]
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.140]   Okay, so multiple times throughout today's discussion,
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.060]   we've been talking about how exercise increases arousal,
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.260]   arousal improves brain function, that's true.
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.260]   You know what's also true?
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.700]   What's also true is that exercise improves brain health
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.340]   in the long-term, yes, through the deployment of things
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.540]   like BDNF, yes, through the deployment of things
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.180]   like osteocalcin and on and on,
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.380]   but it also does so by improving your sleep.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.800]   One question I get a lot is let's say I don't sleep
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.560]   that well, should I exercise?
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.920]   Well, the short answer is yes,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.120]   provided that it was just one night of poor sleep.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400]   In fact, there are studies showing
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.040]   that if you're slightly sleep deprived,
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.340]   meaning one night's poor sleep,
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.700]   so most people need somewhere between six and nine hours
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.720]   of sleep, varies by person, varies by age,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.120]   varies by time of year and so on,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.800]   all discussed in that series with Matt Walker.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.340]   Most people need six to nine hours,
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.820]   but let's say you normally get eight
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.380]   or you normally get seven,
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.160]   but you're down two hours on sleep for whatever reason,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.020]   should you exercise the next morning?
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.940]   The short answer is yes,
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.220]   provided it was just one night of poor sleep.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.420]   It turns out that exercising after a poor night's sleep
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.680]   can help offset some of the negative effects
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.100]   of sleep deprivation on what?
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.220]   On brain performance and health.
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.860]   Now, you don't want to get into a habit of this.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.580]   You don't want to get into a habit of using exercise
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820]   as a way to compensate for sleep loss.
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.160]   So if you don't sleep well for one night,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.440]   exercise is a great way to offset
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.480]   that sleep loss effect on the brain
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.400]   or that would otherwise affect the brain.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.520]   You can compensate for it by doing some exercise.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.560]   Keep in mind, you want to exercise in a way
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.620]   that's not too intense
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.200]   because you can drive your immune system down
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.080]   and be more vulnerable to infections.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.920]   That's certainly the case after a poor night's sleep.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.240]   You also want to be really careful
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.880]   with what you do for that exercise
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.800]   in terms of your coordinated movement.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.680]   It's much easier to get injured when you're sleep deprived.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.280]   In fact, there's a really nice set of studies.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.320]   Lane Norton's talked about this elsewhere,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.200]   that the relationship between sleep,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.300]   or I should say sleep deprivation and injury
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.320]   is a strong one.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.360]   And the relationship between sleep loss and pain
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.880]   and failure to recover from injury is also a strong one.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   The direct point being, if you're slightly sleep deprived,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.080]   sure, go ahead and exercise.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.280]   That will actually help you offset
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.780]   some of the negative effects of that sleep deprivation,
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.340]   but you want to be careful how you exercise
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.280]   so you don't get sick and you don't get injured.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.360]   And there are actually studies of how quickly
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.480]   your brain starts to suffer if you don't exercise.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   And the major thing that I was able to extract
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.700]   from that literature is that after about 10 days
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.460]   of not doing any training,
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.360]   that is no cardiovascular training, no resistance training,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.660]   you start to see significant decrements
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.780]   in brain oxygenation levels,
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.060]   as well as some other markers
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.280]   that are indicative of brain health,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.580]   or that would be indicative of brain health
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.240]   if they were to continue.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.880]   So if you haven't been training at all
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.220]   for a long period of time, your brain is suffering.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.720]   The good news is you can start benefiting your brain
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.260]   very quickly by exercising.
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.140]   So you can keep in mind
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.360]   that if you're having trouble sleeping,
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.440]   or even if you're a great sleeper already,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.400]   getting exercise will further improve
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.820]   the architecture of your sleep.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.240]   In fact, there's some evidence
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.980]   that doing high intensity interval training
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.040]   can improve the amount of deep slow wave sleep that you get.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280]   And there's some additional data showing
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.060]   that if you do high intensity training early in the day,
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.760]   and that's combined with a bunch of other things
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.420]   that stimulate autonomic arousal,
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.380]   so here we are again at autonomic arousal,
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.440]   things like caffeine, if that's in your program,
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.060]   you don't have to drink caffeine.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.620]   Things like getting bright light in your eyes
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.220]   early in the day, definitely do that.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.820]   Don't stare at the sun or any light so bright
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.500]   that it's dangerous or painful to look at,
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.860]   but certainly get bright light in your eyes.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.060]   All those things that increase autonomic arousal
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.340]   early in the day can also help improve the amount
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.280]   and the quality of sleep that you get at night,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.560]   in particular, rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.820]   which is so critical for learning and memory.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.580]   In fact, there's something called the first night effect,
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.880]   which is the amount and quality of rapid eye movement sleep
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.100]   that you get on the first night
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.580]   after trying to learn something,
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.660]   powerfully dictates whether or not you actually learn
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.620]   and remember that thing.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.100]   Because as you recall, learning and memory,
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.500]   neuroplasticity is a two-step process.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.340]   You need to be focused and alert during the encoding phase,
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.100]   during the learning, but it's in states of deep rest,
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.700]   sleep in particular, but also non-sleep deep rest,
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.020]   but rapid eye movement sleep is the kind of king
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.140]   of reshaping your brain connections for the better.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.180]   Unloading the emotional load of experiences
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.180]   that were troubling,
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.340]   that happens during rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.900]   Just a little bit of REM deprivation,
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.780]   rapid eye movement sleep deprivation
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.280]   will make you more emotional
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.980]   and will make the painful experiences
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.700]   of recent and distant past also more painful.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.940]   Get more rapid eye movement sleep if you can.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.460]   It also consolidates learning of things
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.080]   that you want to remember.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.340]   Again, exercise early in the day,
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.300]   in particular, high intensity exercise
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.180]   combined with some of the other things we just discussed,
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.860]   terrific way to improve the amount and quality of sleep
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.140]   that you get at night.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.980]   And of course, all of that geysers up to what?
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.740]   Better brain health and performance in the short-term
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.700]   and in the long-term.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.300]   There are now many, many studies showing
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.460]   that sleep is the thing that mediates many, not all,
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.000]   but many of the positive effects of exercise
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.500]   on brain performance and long-term brain health.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.620]   So what this means is that you have to make sure
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.340]   that you're getting adequate amounts of sleep.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.700]   It's not sufficient just to exercise.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.860]   You need to get proper sleep.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.780]   And I've done multiple episodes
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.420]   on how to optimize your sleep, how to improve your sleep,
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.880]   how to deal with insomnia, shift work.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.740]   If you want to learn about any and all of that,
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.940]   either from podcasts or from our newsletter,
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.780]   go to hubermanlab.com,
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.860]   put sleep into the search function,
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.820]   and it will take you to the episodes
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.320]   and the newsletters that discuss that.
