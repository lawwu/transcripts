[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.080]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.760]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.920]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.120]   and every year as we get closer to December 31st,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.440]   I start to make sure I've done all the right moves
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.720]   for my money, taxes, points, miles, and more.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.520]   So I thought I'd put together an episode
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.440]   to share with all of you what that actually means.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.660]   There is a lot of good content
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.120]   that I hope can help you all be more optimized this year.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.840]   And when it comes to all the tax topics,
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.040]   I wanna give a big shout out to Tal Binder,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.280]   the founder and CEO of Gelt, a tax planning company,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.780]   that I was so impressed with when I met Tal
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.060]   and heard all of his tax knowledge
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.900]   that I knew I had to invest a small amount in the company.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.200]   And since then, I've become a paying customer
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.400]   of their services for my personal and business taxes.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.520]   And Tal spent 90 minutes giving me feedback and advice
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.680]   for all the content in this episode, which was so helpful.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.640]   However, full disclosure, I am not an accountant or a CPA,
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.720]   so you shouldn't take anything I'm about to share
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.040]   as tax advice.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.280]   And if you do want tax advice, talk to your own accountant,
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.760]   or if you wanna check out Gelt,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.360]   you can schedule a call with their team
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.120]   to learn more at allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.840]   Note that they are not a sponsor,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.480]   that is not an affiliate link,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.000]   but Tal did say that he'd let anyone that comes
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.700]   from All The Hacks skip their wait list.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.760]   Okay, let's get into the episode right after this.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.860]   All right, since so much of year-end financial planning
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.200]   is tax-related, I'm gonna start there,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440]   but I figured it would be good to set a tone
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.960]   for some of the principles of how I think about this.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.780]   So my goal is not to break the rules or even bend the rules.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.700]   I'm really trying to play as squarely
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.480]   in the rules as possible.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   But within those rules, I would love to avoid taxes
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.520]   if I could, and if not, I'd love to at least minimize
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.320]   the taxes I do owe, and finally, no matter what,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.160]   I'd love to defer those taxes out
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.000]   as far as I can in the future.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.800]   So that's kind of the overarching theme,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.880]   but let's get into the tactics.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.960]   Now, I realize some of you might have a small business
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.600]   or a side hustle, and there are so many great optimizations
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.160]   for business owners, but I'm gonna focus first
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.240]   on all the things that apply to everyone,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.120]   including W-2 employees.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.020]   So first, I think it makes sense to talk about
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.760]   one of the biggest decisions that you make
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.880]   on your tax return, which is whether you're gonna take
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.320]   the standard deduction or you're gonna itemize.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.300]   So the way it kind of works is that the IRS gives you
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.280]   the ability to just say, I want to take this one deduction
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.640]   and reduce my income by it and not do any extra homework.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.840]   If you're single, it's 12,950.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680]   If you're a joint filer, it's 25,900,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   and it's super straightforward.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.680]   Now, if you wanna itemize, you're basically saying
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.440]   I'm going to take all of my individual deductions,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.040]   add them up, and do that instead.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   Obviously, you wouldn't do those if they didn't exceed
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.400]   the amount of the standard deduction, but if they do,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.560]   then obviously it'd be a better deal.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.940]   And so you can itemize things like charitable contributions,
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.600]   state and local taxes up to a $10,000 limit,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.160]   home mortgage interest, and then sometimes things
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.240]   like medical expenses, investment interests,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.680]   gambling losses, casualty losses, and things like that.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.960]   So if you're kind of on the line
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.120]   where you could go either way, one tactic you could do
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   is bunch all of your itemized deductions
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.180]   by combining multiple years into one
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.640]   so that you can switch between the itemizing one year
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.620]   and the standard deduction the next year.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.960]   So the way you could do that is you could donate
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.800]   all of the money you might wanna donate for two years
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.400]   to charity into one year, and you could either do that
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.800]   by donating to charities or using a donor-advised fund,
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.200]   which we'll talk about later.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.360]   You could prepay your property tax a little early
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.980]   if you're not gonna be at that state and local tax limit.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.240]   You could prepay your January mortgage payment
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.560]   to try to get a little extra
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.260]   mortgage interest contribution in the year.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.680]   Or if you have any other qualifying expenses,
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.280]   you could do those in one year.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.620]   And then the next year, you really try to limit
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.280]   all of those expenses so that you take
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.640]   the standard deduction, and then the following year
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.160]   in January, you could play catch up and do it again
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.960]   and try to itemize more that year.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.320]   So that's one thing you can do if you're on the fence.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.080]   So effectively, what you're doing is you're taking
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.860]   those expenses that you can itemize,
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.920]   and you're either deferring them out
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.240]   or accelerating them in.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.340]   But you could do something similar with income.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.820]   It's not always as easy if you don't own a business
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.240]   where you could just say, oh, I'm going to ask someone
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.760]   to pay me in January instead of now,
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.400]   or ask someone to prepay me.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.720]   But I do have one example recently,
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.440]   which was someone I know was laid off from their job,
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.720]   and their employer told them,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.060]   well, we would like to give you a severance
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.320]   as soon as you return this document to us.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.440]   And it happened in December, and he asked
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.200]   how long he had to sign the document.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   And they actually told him he could sign it
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.960]   any time before the end of the year,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.400]   and they would process that severance payment a week later.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.800]   So he actually waited so that next year,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.240]   he would get that severance payment
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   and have it come in the following tax year,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.800]   since he assumed he would likely be at a lower income
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.600]   'cause he didn't have a job right now.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.640]   So when you think about whether you're going to be making
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.160]   more or less income next year compared to this year,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.880]   you can decide, does it make sense
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.440]   to try to defer some of that income or bring it in?
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.820]   So I mentioned charitable donations,
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.040]   but I want to cover a few components of it.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.000]   So you probably know that if you donate money
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.680]   to a nonprofit, you can deduct that on your taxes.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.520]   Great, but did you also know
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.080]   that any of the non-cash property you donate,
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.660]   whether it's clothes or electronics
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.000]   or anything you drop off at Goodwill, is also a deduction.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.800]   And if you save the receipt they give you,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.980]   which is usually blank, and you fill it out,
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.400]   you can actually get a tax donation up to $5,000.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.280]   You just need to make sure you write down what you donated
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.520]   and you fill out a receipt
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.960]   so that you have something to have on hand
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.040]   in case you ever have questions down the road.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.680]   And if you're not sure of the amount,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.000]   definitely don't just put $5,000
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.760]   unless you want someone to ask questions.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.620]   I would try to put a number that's more accurate.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.680]   But one of the most effective things to donate
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.120]   is appreciated assets,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.580]   because you can save even more when you give.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.400]   So let's take a stock you bought a long time ago for $100,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.240]   and let's say it's now worth $1,000.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.560]   When you sell that stock,
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.700]   you're gonna have to pay taxes on the $900 of gains.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.400]   Now, it's gonna be long-term cap gains,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.360]   but you're also gonna need to pay state taxes
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.400]   depending on where you live.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.940]   And in California, that could add up to like 33%.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.020]   So you've got $900 gain,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.000]   you have to pay taxes on a third of it,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.720]   you're gonna end up owing about $300.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.560]   Now, that means that at the end of the day,
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.880]   you're actually gonna take home $700.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.180]   Now, you could go donate that $700 to a charity
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.180]   and get a $700 deduction.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.060]   What you can also do
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.540]   is you can actually donate that $1,000 of stock.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.320]   You'll give the charity $1,000,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.420]   you'll get $1,000 deduction,
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.180]   they'll get $1,000,
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.400]   but you don't actually have to pay any capital gains tax.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.580]   So you never pay capital gains tax
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.420]   on the appreciated assets you donate,
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.380]   and you get the full tax deduction.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.620]   So that's a great option for giving to charity.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.660]   And we'll talk about the wash sale rule later.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.640]   But it turns out the best I understand it,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.760]   you're not actually impacted by the wash sale rule
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.040]   when you donate to charity.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.960]   So you could just buy that stock right away the next day
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   and replace it if you really wanna hold it.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.920]   So if you own any appreciated assets,
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.760]   you should probably not ever be donating to charity
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   in any format other than those appreciated assets.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.200]   Because if you wanted to donate $1,000,
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.400]   you're going to save money on taxes
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.680]   by donating $1,000 of appreciated securities
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.980]   versus donating $1,000 outright.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.820]   And if you were gonna donate the $1,000 anyways,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.060]   you could always just rebuy those securities.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.700]   Now, one of the things that makes this whole thing
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.500]   a little tricky is that donating appreciated securities
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.960]   is not as simple and quick and straightforward
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.620]   as just putting a credit card number
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.720]   on the donation widget on some charities website.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.460]   However, one thing I love doing,
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.540]   and I know you've heard me talk about it a lot,
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.740]   is setting up a donor advised fund.
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.860]   So it's a charitable giving vehicle,
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.820]   basically a fund that you create.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.580]   And when you donate to that fund,
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.320]   you're donating to a nonprofit
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.800]   and you're getting the tax deduction right away.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.520]   However, you're in control of where those funds go.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.620]   And so you can choose to divvy them out at a later date
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.720]   to any number of different organizations.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.680]   So you could donate $1,000 in 2022,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.960]   and you could donate that from appreciated securities
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.040]   that would have actually only resulted in you having $700.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   And then later in the future,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.400]   you could donate $100 to one organization,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.840]   $500 to another.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.120]   You can kind of decide whenever you want.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.440]   And until you're ready to donate,
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.320]   you can actually invest the funds
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.160]   in your donor advised fund
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.620]   so that the money still grows with market appreciation.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.040]   I think you've all heard me talk about Daffy before.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.200]   Daffy's how I manage my donor advised fund.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.760]   They're a partner of the show.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.220]   You can get $25 for free when you use them
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.540]   at allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.520]   I was using it before they partnered with us
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.120]   and I'll be using it long after
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   if they ever stop partnering with the show.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.880]   So definitely check that out.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.600]   It's a great product.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.040]   Speaking of capital gains,
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.600]   let's talk a little bit about tax loss harvesting.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.800]   You might have some stocks or index funds
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.500]   or other securities that you bought,
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.120]   maybe even crypto at a price higher
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.380]   than what they're at today,
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.640]   which means you have a loss.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.880]   Now, when you sell that stock,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.560]   you can actually capture that loss
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.960]   and use it to offset other gains
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.560]   or offset your income up to $3,000 a year.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.760]   So if you're sitting on losses right now
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.480]   before the end of the year and you have any capital gains,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.180]   it might be a really good opportunity
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.840]   to sell those securities so that you can use that loss
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.120]   to lower your tax liability for the year.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.360]   Now, if you don't have any capital gains to use,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.040]   you can still carry over that loss to future years
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.160]   and use it to offset future capital gains
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.620]   or even offset your income $3,000 a year at a time.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.100]   However, the wash sale rule
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.240]   is a really important factor here.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.880]   What it basically says is you can't sell a security,
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.520]   take a loss, and then rebuy that security for 30 days.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.600]   So that means if you have a loss on something,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.480]   but you actually wanna hold it as part of your portfolio,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.740]   you can't just sell it and buy it back right away.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.320]   Otherwise, the loss gets offset
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.560]   and you actually don't get any of the benefit.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.560]   However, you can buy something that's very similar,
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.740]   but not substantially identical.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.000]   So in the case of some common index fund pairing examples,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.240]   you've got VTI,
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.220]   which is a total stock market index fund from Vanguard,
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.860]   but you also have ITOT,
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.240]   which is an iShares total stock market index fund,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.300]   or you have Schwab's SCHB,
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.880]   which is another US broad market index fund.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.760]   So obviously you could just sell something
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.320]   and not hold it for 30 days,
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.880]   and you'd be exposed to whatever price changes happen
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.100]   over those 30 days,
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.520]   but you also can buy something different.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.480]   Now, products like Wealthfront and other robo-advisors
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.960]   will do this automatically for you,
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   but if you're managing your investments
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.160]   in your own brokerage firm, you can do this yourself.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.000]   You just have to sell things at a loss
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.360]   and not rebuy them for 30 days.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.400]   Because all my long-term investments are at Wealthfront,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   I don't think about it, it happens automatically,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.720]   so I don't have to worry about it.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.800]   In fact, this year, it looks like I've harvested
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.560]   over 10% of the value of my portfolio
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.080]   as losses I can use to offset gains,
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.040]   both in the portfolio and outside of it.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.080]   Now, I'm no longer a Wealthfront employee.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.280]   Amy, my wife, still does work at Wealthfront,
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.680]   but if you wanna get $5,000 managed free,
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.320]   you can use my personal referral link.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.760]   It's allthehacks.com/wealthfront.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.760]   Now, when it comes to crypto,
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.320]   there's actually no wash sale rule
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.920]   because they're not securities.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.760]   So if you're holding any crypto tokens and they're down,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.360]   you can sell them and then buy them right back
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.080]   and book that loss and be able to use that
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.480]   to offset any gains you have or $3,000 of income.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.320]   When it comes to crypto, if you're in a situation like me,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.380]   where you have crypto that you have no ability to access
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.120]   because it was at Coinbase or FTX or any other projects
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.080]   that are kind of in the middle of either bankruptcy
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.000]   proceedings or you're trying to figure out what happens
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.860]   or withdrawals are paused, that's a different story.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.720]   I think right now the best option
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.240]   and what I'm doing is just waiting.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.000]   You do have the ability, if you're certain
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.160]   you're never getting anything back,
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.480]   to take an abandonment loss.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.600]   That's something that I'm not familiar enough with
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.360]   to give you a lot of explanation.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.100]   But fortunately, the team at Gelt has written
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.120]   an entire little tax guide all about tax tips
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.360]   for a recession that includes things like abandonment
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   or even small business stock losses.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.920]   So I'll include a link to the show notes to that guide
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.640]   where there's a lot more detail there,
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.940]   but that's just something to consider as well.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.160]   I wanna tell you all about the most amazing way
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.540]   to buy a second home.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.580]   And I know because we actually bought one
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.420]   for 1/8th the cost.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.500]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares,
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.380]   I'm talking about Picasso, and I'm excited to partner
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.700]   with them for this episode.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.660]   So how does it work?
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.020]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.540]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.500]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.560]   and you can buy as little as 1/8th of the property.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.900]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.780]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.780]   handling design, cleaning, bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.740]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.000]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.660]   When we found Picasso, it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.780]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.740]   we toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.180]   Since then, it's truly become our second home
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.900]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.100]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.460]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.780]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.940]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.300]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.540]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.620]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.160]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.820]   which means you can see new listings
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.620]   before they go on the website
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.700]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.700]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso, P-A-C-A-S-S-O.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.100]   I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.220]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.820]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.700]   So I love having an easy way
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.920]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.780]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens,
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.660]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.900]   for this episode.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.900]   I started taking it because I wanted to see
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.220]   what all the hype was about,
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.340]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.700]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.860]   add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.060]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.460]   and energized for the day,
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.180]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.580]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.020]   minerals, and superfoods,
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.860]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.320]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals,
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.020]   or artificial anything.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.780]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.320]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.220]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.620]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.140]   All you have to do is visit
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.820]   allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.660]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.700]   to take ownership over your health
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.060]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.620]   Another opportunity, if you have some gains this year,
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.860]   but you don't have any losses to offset them,
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.300]   is to look into Opportunity Zone Investing.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.500]   If you make an investment
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.220]   into a Qualified Opportunity Zone,
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.260]   and these are certain types of real estate investments,
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.280]   and I'm certainly not the expert here,
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.820]   I'm just sharing what I've learned,
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.460]   you actually can defer capital gains
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.260]   by reinvesting those gains
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.880]   into a Qualified Opportunity Zone,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.840]   which is usually areas of a city that are lower income,
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.940]   and you're investing in real estate projects there.
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.540]   Obviously, that comes with significantly more risk
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.100]   than just harvesting losses from your securities,
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.980]   but it is one way to defer capital gains into the future.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.500]   And then on the topic of investment,
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500]   let's talk a little bit about a few other things
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.300]   you could do before the end of the year.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.040]   One that I love is iBonds.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.500]   They're Series I savings bonds issued by the US government,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.020]   and they peg the interest rate to inflation.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.120]   And so how it works is they lock an interest rate in
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.980]   for six months, and then it changes every six months.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.260]   Currently, the interest rate is 6.89%.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.700]   You do have to keep your money in there
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.020]   for at least one year,
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.540]   and if you take your money out in less than five years,
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.180]   you lose the last three months of your interest.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.260]   But there are very few places you can go
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.660]   to earn 6% or more that I'm aware of,
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.720]   and so one option before the end of the year
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.700]   is to invest in iBonds.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.060]   You can only invest $10,000 per person or entity,
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.520]   so you could put in 10,000 for you, your spouse,
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.660]   you could put it in for your kids,
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.540]   or you could even put it in for a trust.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.060]   So that's something that, as long as you do it before April,
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.140]   you lock in the 6.89% for the first six months.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.940]   I don't know what inflation will look like
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.780]   when it comes to reevaluating that interest rate in April,
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.520]   but whatever the new rate that comes out then will be,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.980]   you'll be subject to that rate for the next six months,
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.660]   and then you can kind of wait and see
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.820]   what the rate is in the future
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.180]   and decide whether it makes sense to take anything out.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.100]   To do that, you have to go to treasurydirect.gov.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.700]   Unfortunately, it is a really terrible website
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.140]   built by the US government.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.900]   It's messy and not great, but it works, it's functional,
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.760]   and I was able to use it pretty easily.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.940]   It just looks like I was using something from 10 years ago.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.580]   While we're still talking about investments,
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.620]   if you work at a company
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.580]   and you've been issued any stock options
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.220]   that are ISOs or incentive stock options,
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.180]   usually the problem with exercising them
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.260]   is it generates a certain amount of income,
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.140]   but not income the way your taxes are normally calculated,
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.820]   income that's only subject
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.180]   to what's called the alternative minimum tax,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.820]   and I won't go into too much detail here,
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.100]   but basically the IRS says
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.780]   there's two ways to calculate your taxes,
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.460]   and if you owe more one way than you do the other way,
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.820]   we use that one.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.060]   You can, if you're not already subject to AMT,
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.380]   with the help of an accountant,
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.560]   I wouldn't necessarily try to do this yourself,
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.040]   you could figure out the amount of ISOs you can exercise
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.300]   that won't put you into that limit,
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.260]   and it might allow you to exercise some of your stock
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.820]   without any tax implications a little earlier.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.740]   Obviously, you have to pay to do the exercising,
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.500]   but you wouldn't have to pay the extra taxes that year.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.180]   Finally, retirement accounts,
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.660]   you don't necessarily have to do
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.300]   all of the retirement contributions
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.540]   before the end of the year.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.900]   Things like IRAs and solo 401ks,
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.620]   you actually have until April,
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.820]   or in some cases October if you file an extension,
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.780]   but if you haven't contributed to your 401k
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.160]   and you can use your last paycheck
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.260]   before the end of the year,
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.580]   by the time this comes out, that's an option.
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.980]   I always try to just do all of my contributing
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.900]   in the calendar tax year, not that it's necessary.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.980]   So that's contributing to any retirement accounts
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.780]   outside of your 401k,
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.700]   or contributing to a backdoor Roth contribution,
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.180]   which is most people that have a W-2 job
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.140]   aren't eligible for contributing to a traditional
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.420]   or a Roth IRA, if you are, great.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.020]   But if not, and I'll encourage you to Google around
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.780]   for backdoor Roth IRAs,
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.180]   but you can contribute to a traditional IRA,
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.700]   even if you're not eligible for the tax deductibility of it,
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.020]   you can make a non-deductible contribution,
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.380]   and then you can roll that non-deductible contribution
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.980]   over into a Roth IRA.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.020]   Why the IRS has come out and said that this is okay,
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.540]   but not just made it easy to do directly is beyond me,
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.640]   so are many things in the tax code.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.740]   One thing I will say is,
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.420]   if you already have traditional IRA investments,
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.100]   it can get really complicated
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.100]   because you can't just choose which funds you roll over.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.220]   So definitely, if you're in that situation,
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.820]   talk to an accountant before thinking
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.820]   about doing any backdoor Roth IRAs.
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.500]   And depending on your tax situation this year
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.740]   relative to next year,
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.620]   you could consider doing a Roth conversion,
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.960]   which is taking any of your pre-tax retirement accounts
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.820]   and converting them to Roth accounts.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.460]   Whether they're traditional 401ks or IRAs,
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.660]   you can roll them over into a Roth account,
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.460]   which then means you don't have to pay any taxes
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.460]   on the gains in those accounts
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.100]   as long as you take them out in retirement.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.460]   So that's an option.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.420]   It will result in you owing taxes for that conversion.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.500]   So it wouldn't be a great idea
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.620]   if 2022 was a really high tax year for you.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.980]   But if you weren't in that situation,
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.460]   it could be something worth considering
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.380]   before the end of the year.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.820]   If you have kids and you wanna contribute to a 529
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.260]   for their educational expenses or say for their college,
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.140]   that's something you can do up to $16,000 a year per child.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.220]   Technically, it's actually from each individual
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.300]   to another individual.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.820]   So if a couple wanted to gift it to two kids,
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.060]   it would be each person giving to each kid.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.660]   So you could actually gift 32,000 per person.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.780]   So that's something you could do.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.260]   If you wanted to super fund the 529,
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.260]   if you haven't done that,
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.460]   you can bulk give up to five years at once.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.980]   So depending on your state,
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.860]   you may or may not get a little bit of tax break
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:15.860]   for putting money in,
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.700]   but the IRS doesn't give you any breaks.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.340]   And I know in California, you don't.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.900]   But that money does get to grow tax-free
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.460]   as long as you are using it
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.700]   for a qualified educational expense, which is college.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.180]   And now it's actually expanded
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.480]   to even include things like private school
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.700]   and a few other things.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.620]   And it's not tied to one person.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.900]   So if you don't use it all up,
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.100]   you can pass it down to other children or grandchildren.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.660]   And there's even some stipulations
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.580]   that if your child gets a scholarship,
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.620]   the fees to withdraw from it get waived.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.620]   When it comes to some of your employer benefits,
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.300]   definitely make sure that you've used up any of the money
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.040]   in your FSA accounts or transit accounts
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.300]   before the end of the year.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.960]   There's a few different types of accounts.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.220]   The most common I've seen is FSAs for medical expenses.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.220]   And while you can usually roll over
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.060]   a small amount of hundreds of dollars,
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.180]   depending on your employer's plan rules,
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.140]   you usually have to spend all of the money
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.860]   in those accounts before the end of the year.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.560]   So if you have leftover funds, a few options,
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.100]   there are always things you could go buy
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.360]   before the end of the year.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.660]   There are products and services like blood tests,
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.880]   genetic tests, new baby monitor, thermometers.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.440]   Those kinds of things are all eligible expenses.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.900]   So that's something I've done in the past.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.800]   Or if there's really nothing you need,
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.620]   you can always reach out to a local shelter or charity,
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.140]   see if there's anything that they need
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.860]   and you could go buy it for them.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.100]   If you have a dependent care FSA,
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.220]   just make sure you submit those expenses.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.740]   And then with HSAs, it's actually not something
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.860]   that you have to use it or lose it.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.260]   So I wouldn't feel any stress.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.180]   In fact, HSAs are really cool
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.780]   because you put money in tax-free,
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.740]   the money grows tax-free and you take it out tax-free.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.380]   So there's a pretty strong argument
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.020]   to not take your money out from your HSA now.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.140]   But if you haven't maxed out the contributions
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.480]   and you want to, you can put up to $3,650
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.520]   in if you have individual coverage
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.280]   or $7,300 if you have family coverage.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.120]   When I say coverage, that means covered
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.920]   by a high-deductible health plan.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.760]   If you weren't covered
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.800]   by a high-deductible health plan in 2022,
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.960]   then you can't contribute to an HSA.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.400]   But if you haven't maxed that out,
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.480]   that is something you could do before the end of the year.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.960]   Okay, this one's not that big,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.640]   but there are some tax benefits
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.680]   for energy efficiency upgrades that you can make
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.960]   before the end of the year.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.420]   So any home improvements you've made
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.380]   might be eligible for a tax credit.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.940]   The tax credit in 2022 is equal to 10%
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.200]   of the cost of those improvements.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.300]   That means windows, doors, insulation, roofs,
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.100]   heat pumps, water heaters, furnaces.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.540]   The only catch is that the total credit
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.020]   is up to $500 in your lifetime.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.420]   And it's like 300 for building property,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.440]   200 for window components.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.180]   So it's not a massive credit,
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.940]   but if you this year invested in any of those things,
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.140]   central air units,
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.340]   I know we put in a new hot water heater that broke
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.800]   and we put in air conditioning.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.420]   So I think that might actually get us to that $500 maximum.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.580]   Also, if you did invest in solar,
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.820]   you can usually get up to about 30% back
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.100]   in those investments.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.340]   The only catch there is that that must be in service
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.460]   by the end of the year.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.900]   So if you haven't done this,
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.820]   it's probably really unlikely
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.420]   that it's going to be something that you're able to do
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.380]   in the next couple of days.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.260]   And then finally, if you purchased
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.460]   or if you somehow are able to purchase
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.500]   and take possession of an electric vehicle
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.360]   that was assembled in the US before the end of the year,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.780]   you might be able to save up to $7,500
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.940]   of the cost in taxes for the EV tax credit in 2022.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.260]   So one tax optimization I've heard a few people talk about
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.340]   is that businesses have so many more opportunities
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.900]   to be more tax efficient because of the rules
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.020]   and regulations we have in this country,
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.700]   that you could try to get your employer
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.240]   to hire you as a business instead of as a W2 employee.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.580]   Actually talked a bit about this with Tal.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.640]   And while it is possible,
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.220]   there are a few really important things to consider.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.380]   One, you can't just take your job and convert it right away
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.420]   and expect the IRS to let that be okay,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.020]   unless you really change something about the way you operate.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.540]   If you're a designer and you convert from an employee
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.960]   to a contractor and you take on three or four other clients
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.560]   as a design agency, that might make sense.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.120]   But if you just have one client
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.660]   and you're getting paid about the same amount
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.020]   and you just switch the type,
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.180]   it's unlikely that's gonna hold up.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.680]   So if you are actually changing the style of business
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.840]   you operate, great.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.100]   However, one really important thing to consider
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.500]   is that it is so much harder to get approved for loans,
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.140]   especially mortgages, when you're not a W2 employee.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.540]   When I was talking to Tal, he's seen clients
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.700]   who even have over a million dollars of income a year
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.280]   struggle to get approved for a mortgage.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.620]   I think I'd always heard that that was such
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.100]   an awesome opportunity, but kind of understanding
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.860]   that you really fundamentally need to change
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.820]   how you operate and some of the stresses
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.300]   it might put on you if you're trying to buy a home.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.840]   I don't think it's really worth it
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.340]   for anyone who's not actually running a business.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.580]   However, if you are running a business,
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.980]   there are a handful of tax optimizations to think about.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.100]   One is doing an S-corp election,
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.100]   which makes it a little bit more efficient
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.540]   for some types of businesses.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.740]   Obviously, for all of these,
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.060]   you should be talking to an accountant
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.220]   and not just taking anything I say as advice,
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.780]   but it will help you avoid some of the Social Security
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.900]   and Medicare taxes that you would pay
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.140]   on your individual income if you weren't an S-corp.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.020]   There's the home office deduction.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.600]   And one cool thing I learned recently
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.500]   is that you don't necessarily have to allocate your home
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.420]   by a percentage of square feet.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.340]   You might be able to allocate it by a percentage of rooms.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.080]   So if you have seven rooms in your house
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.080]   and your office is one of them,
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.820]   maybe you could use one seventh instead of square foot.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.180]   The meal deduction, which actually for this year,
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.740]   you can deduct 100% of meals.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.940]   And what is a business meeting in a pandemic world?
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.080]   If you're doing a virtual meeting over Zoom
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.800]   and having lunch over that meeting,
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.320]   I think there's an argument to be made
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.060]   that that's also a business meal.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.020]   There's qualified business income,
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.300]   which is something you should talk to an accountant about.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.620]   If you have kids and there's really any argument
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.200]   that those kids are doing work for the business,
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.100]   whether they're old enough to actually do work
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.740]   or whether they're young enough to maybe just be models
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.300]   in photos that you put on your company's website,
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.740]   you can hire your children.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.700]   And one of the coolest things about doing this
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.840]   is that if your children have income,
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.220]   which also means, by the way, they have to file their taxes,
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.660]   but they can contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.540]   And so if you think about being able to put money
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.420]   into an account for your kids when they're very young
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.340]   and letting that compound for 60 plus years,
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.940]   it could be really, really impactful on their future.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.780]   There's also bonus depreciation,
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.420]   which is if you buy something like a car
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.500]   that weighs over 6,000 pounds,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.100]   then you can actually accelerate the depreciation
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.020]   all in one year.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.660]   Obviously that car has to be for business purposes.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.140]   There's a bunch of interesting optimizations
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.740]   when it comes to self-employed retirement plans,
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.060]   SEP IRAs, solo 401ks,
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.180]   where you can actually contribute more
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.180]   than the amount you could contribute to your 401k
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.140]   as an employee at a company.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.380]   There's also countless different expenses
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.000]   that qualify as business expenses.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.500]   So if you're taking a course,
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.580]   if you're paying an annual fee on your business credit card,
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.100]   if you're buying anything that you use for work.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.140]   So there's really a lot of stuff here.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.140]   I just use it to highlight some of the things
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.100]   you should use to go start a conversation
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.180]   with your accountant,
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.540]   not anything that you should take as advice.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.920]   You all know I love credit card points.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.860]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.500]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.220]   It's a free app that helps you manage
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.420]   all of your credit cards in one place
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.500]   and makes it easy to find the right card
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.140]   to maximize your category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.340]   You can also load it on your partner's phone
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.340]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.320]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.780]   and recurring credit from over 5,000 cards.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.780]   And they also track and help you use your Amex,
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.960]   Chase, Bank of America, or Citibank offers
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.420]   to save even more money every day.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.940]   And with their browser extension,
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.740]   you can actually activate every single Amex
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.160]   and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.640]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.140]   you can do all of this without having to give up
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.700]   any personal or banking details.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.460]   The app is free to download,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.900]   and many of the features are free as well.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.620]   But if you wanna try out the pro version,
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.940]   there's a free trial.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.780]   And if you decide you wanna sign up after the trial,
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.420]   which you probably will,
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.380]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.100]   to get 20% off.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:38.100]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.100]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.500]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.380]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.500]   for a good hang.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.580]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.540]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.460]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.420]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.180]   take care of the supplies.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.980]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.860]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.260]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.220]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.700]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.780]   that you got through another week.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.860]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.420]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.180]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.260]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.940]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.500]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.500]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.540]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.380]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.420]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.060]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.540]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.180]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.460]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.500]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.700]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.620]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to

[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.740]   Okay, that covers most of the year-end stuff
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.220]   related to taxes,
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.820]   but there are a few other year-end things
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.780]   that I wanna talk about
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.060]   that are mostly about points and miles.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.660]   But before I get to them,
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.180]   I do also wanna make sure I cover
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.620]   a few of the interesting things that I learned
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.020]   that I'm actually gonna put into place next year
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.780]   because I think they're relevant.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.460]   And just because you can't use them this year
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.420]   doesn't mean you might not wanna start thinking about them.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:39.020]   So first off, when it comes to the HSA and FSA stuff,
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.780]   I'm actively thinking about things
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.100]   that I might wanna do next year
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.460]   so I can make those elections
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.380]   and decide how much to contribute.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.300]   I'm definitely gonna wanna do some blood work
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.860]   that probably won't get covered.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.460]   I'm considering whether I wanna do the GRAIL test,
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.340]   which is a early pre-screening test for cancer
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.420]   with blood work that's in the hundreds of dollars range.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.300]   And because of the cancer in my family history,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.060]   I just wanna start thinking about those kinds of things.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.580]   The other one is the Augusta rule,
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.140]   which funny enough is actually created
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.300]   to protect the residents of Augusta, Georgia
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.540]   who rented out their homes
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.700]   to attendees of the Masters Golf Tournament.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.860]   But it basically says that you can rent out your home
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.820]   for up to 14 nights a year
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.540]   without needing to report any of that rental income
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.020]   on your tax return.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.100]   So if you've been considering renting out your place
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.180]   on Airbnb while you're traveling,
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.580]   while you're out of town,
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.660]   but really only for a couple weeks,
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.140]   this is a really great opportunity
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.420]   to bring in some extra income with no tax consequences.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.820]   Obviously, it's maybe possible for you to do this
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.220]   before the end of the year,
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.740]   but it's probably unlikely given the time of year.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.620]   But it is something that I might start thinking about
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.740]   for next year if we have one or two trips planned.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.260]   One cool hack that I've been shared by a few people
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.780]   is if you have a business,
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.060]   you can actually have your business rent your home
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.020]   to use it for things.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.380]   So if I were gonna do a film shoot in the house,
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.900]   the business could rent the home from me,
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.500]   and I would, in effect, be able to pay with company funds
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.700]   to my personal without having to pay taxes.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.180]   So it makes it really efficient for transferring money
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.580]   from the business to yourself without any tax consequences.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.340]   Obviously, this only works
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.340]   if you're actually using it for those purposes.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.980]   So if you're actually making videos,
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.940]   there's a lot of good evidence that you're doing so
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.100]   because you have video evidence of that.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.380]   But I don't think this is the kind of thing
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.220]   that I would test out if it wasn't actually true.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.900]   Finally, the last thing I've been thinking about
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.700]   is whether I add more California muni bonds
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.140]   to my investment portfolio.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.220]   Obviously, there are muni bonds in every state,
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.380]   but muni bonds happen to be triple-tax-free
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.140]   from federal, state, and local income.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.020]   And with taxes in California where they are
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.340]   and interest rates where they are,
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.940]   it seems like something that I might increase
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.780]   the allocation to in my investment portfolio next year.
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.260]   That's a lot about taxes.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.780]   I just wanna talk about some of the end-of-the-year things
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.780]   you should be thinking about when it comes to your points
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.860]   and your miles.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.900]   So first off, I always try to make sure
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.500]   that at least once every year,
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.900]   I'm looking at all my accounts to figure out
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.740]   whether any of them have balances that are gonna expire.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.820]   If you have points related to a credit card,
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.420]   then I wouldn't really need to worry about this
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.020]   because you're probably accumulating
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.220]   at least some number of points each month,
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.820]   and almost all mileage accounts,
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.700]   not all, but almost all, will not expire
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.060]   as long as there's some activity in the account.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.740]   Hotel points seem to expire more frequently than airlines.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.180]   There are a lot of airlines that have shifted
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.780]   to no expiration dates,
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.020]   but it's really easy to keep things from expiring,
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.340]   especially with hotels.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.660]   Sometimes my wife and I just transfer points
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.740]   between each other because a lot of hotel chains
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.660]   allow that for free,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.820]   and that extends the life of the points.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.740]   On airlines, there are a lot of airlines
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.940]   that no longer have expiration dates,
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.860]   but if they do, there are some simple things you can do,
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.540]   whether it's using their shopping portal
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.020]   to make a small purchase,
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.380]   whether it's buying a nominal amount of points,
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.700]   or you could donate a nominal amount of points,
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.340]   or you can redeem a small number of points
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.940]   for a magazine subscription.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.980]   Really, any activity in your account
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.780]   will keep those balances active.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.460]   Okay, when it comes to status at the end of the year,
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.140]   yes, if you're chasing status,
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.260]   whether it's on an airline,
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.180]   or whether it's on a hotel chain,
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.940]   you can always consider whether you wanna make
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.820]   a mileage run or a mattress run.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:09.700]   This is where, let's say,
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.940]   you just need an extra four flight segments
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.580]   before the end of the year to hit a certain level of status.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.300]   You could actually just buy a ticket
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.660]   wherever the cheapest place to go is with one layover.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.580]   It might be San Francisco to Los Angeles to Las Vegas,
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.100]   back to Los Angeles, back to San Francisco.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.900]   I haven't really ever been too heavy on the mileage runs,
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.520]   but there was one year where I remember flying to San Diego,
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.660]   getting off and getting right back on the same plane
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.940]   to come back to San Francisco
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.680]   because I was just like 800 miles short
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.200]   of hitting that next level of United status.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.880]   On hotels, you can do the same thing.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.340]   You could book a night at a really cheap hotel,
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.340]   go stay there.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.780]   You do need to show up,
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.300]   but you don't necessarily need to stay there the whole time.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.780]   So if you're three nights away from status,
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.260]   you could book a really cheap Marriott property,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.340]   go check in, ruffle up the bed sheets,
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.380]   put on the do not disturb, and then head back home.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.020]   I haven't really in the most recent years
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.820]   found status to be that valuable
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.340]   that I really wanna go to those extents,
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.780]   but I totally 10 years ago was doing this.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.860]   So another big thing to do before the end of the year
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.380]   is if you have Delta or Marriott status,
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.380]   you might have some choice benefits,
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.860]   which with Delta, I think if you hit platinum or diamond,
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.620]   and with Marriott, if you hit platinum or titanium,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.860]   you basically get some benefits
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.020]   that you have to select before the end of the year.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.500]   Things like suite upgrades or premier upgrades
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.460]   or free lounge access passes and things like that.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.160]   So I would definitely go and make sure you do that
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.320]   before the end of the year.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.120]   Also, there are some hotel chains
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.980]   that give you free night certificates.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.380]   Not all of them are tied to the calendar year,
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.520]   but definitely go and make sure
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.340]   that if you have any free night certificates,
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.380]   you book them or even maybe use them
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.260]   before the end of the year if you need to.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.660]   Then a lot of credit cards
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.900]   have a bunch of different types of credits.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.980]   Some of them are tied to the calendar year
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.260]   and some of them are tied to the card member year.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.400]   I'll run through all of them for the sake of comprehension,
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.460]   but the most important ones,
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.660]   'cause it's December, are the annual ones.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.340]   So on a bunch of Amex cards, platinum, gold,
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.040]   and the Hilton Aspire, you have an airline credit.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.280]   Whether that's $100 or $200 or $250,
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.400]   basically the credit card is gonna reimburse you
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.100]   for purchases on airlines
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.060]   and you need to use that before the end of the year.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.700]   You actually need to select your airline first
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.220]   and you can actually only have one airline selected.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.140]   I have had some success in the past
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.320]   live chatting with Amex on their app or on the website
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.220]   and asking them to make a switch.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.420]   They're unlikely to do it multiple times throughout the year
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.980]   but if you don't ask every year,
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.580]   they're usually willing to do it.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.540]   And there are some really great threads on Flyer Talk
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.540]   if you want to learn about some of the creative ways
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.460]   to take advantage of those airline credits
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.020]   because they're intentionally not supposed to be
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.800]   for buying flights, but for certain airlines,
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.880]   there are ways for those credits to be used
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.260]   to maybe buy a travel bank credit or a small cheap ticket
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.800]   or you could pay for part of your ticket with a gift card
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.040]   and the incremental amount gets coded as an upsell
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.080]   instead of as a ticket.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.120]   So that's something to go look at.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.520]   There's also another few cards, the City Prestige,
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.600]   the Chase Ritz-Carlton, the Bank of America Premium Rewards
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.800]   that have annual credits
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.240]   that I think are a little easier to use
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.260]   but that expire at the end of the year.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.420]   There are a few other credits.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.260]   The Platinum Card has a $200 prepaid hotel credit.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.900]   There's a $200 Dell credit that expires for a Platinum Card
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.300]   depending on whether you've used that before.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.420]   The Platinum Card has a bunch of other credits
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.180]   that are worth making sure you've used.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.220]   There's the $200 prepaid hotel credit
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.340]   that you use booking an Amex travel.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.660]   There's a $200 Dell credit that I actually used
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.400]   to buy the original microphone to kick off this podcast.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.620]   I've used it a long time ago
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.260]   but that's one that is on a calendar year schedule.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.700]   There's your $50 every six month Saks credit
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.740]   if you haven't used.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.620]   Two suggestions of how I've used it in the past.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   We don't really like to buy fancy soap
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.220]   but we've used our Saks credit to buy Aesop soap
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.240]   and it's just really great soap.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.100]   I also just bought a couple pairs of Mack Weldon underwear
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.980]   which are maybe a little expensive but very comfortable
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.740]   and free if you use your Saks credit.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.260]   There's also the Uber credit of $15 every month
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.340]   but it's actually $35 in December
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.180]   so definitely make sure you use that.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.380]   We almost always use it for Uber Eats
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.460]   but you can use it for Uber as well.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.460]   And then finally each month
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.860]   there's the digital entertainment credit on the platinum card
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.980]   which you can use for things like Sirius XM
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.420]   or New York Times and other streaming services.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.140]   The Amex Gold has smaller credits.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.620]   They've got $10 a month dining and $10 a month Uber.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.260]   Those aren't really annual because they're monthly
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.580]   but just reminder if you're not using them.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.780]   Similarly Chase has the DoorDash credit on the Chase Reserve
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.420]   and a GoPuff credit on literally every Chase card.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.140]   Those are credits that are tied to the month
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.460]   that just reminders to use.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.420]   On the card member year credits,
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.460]   those are things like on the Venture X
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.380]   you get a $300 a year travel credit.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.220]   On the Chase Reserve you get a $300 a year travel credit.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.460]   Those credits are on the cycle of cardholder year.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.300]   So whenever you open the card you have a year to use them.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.820]   The Chase credit's really easy to use.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.220]   You just have to spend on travel
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.860]   and it automatically gets used.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.700]   On the Venture X one you have to go into the portal
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.140]   and book something.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.540]   The Chase Sapphire Preferred card
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.980]   also has a $50 hotel credit when you book in their portal.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.180]   And then finally the Hilton Aspire card
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.940]   has a $250 resort credit at Hilton Properties.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:11.780]   If you notice I mentioned
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.020]   the Hilton Aspire card a few times.
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.300]   It's only because I recently looked into this card
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.100]   and we actually signed up for it.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.180]   The reason we looked at it was,
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.500]   is actually I think a pretty good deal
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.460]   for someone who's staying at Hilton's or traveling a lot.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.140]   It does have a high annual fee of $450
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.640]   but you get complimentary diamond status
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.460]   which is their top tier status with free breakfast.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.460]   You get a $250 airline credit
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.780]   that if you're able to use reduces that annual fee to $200.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.260]   You get an annual free night
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.540]   at a Hilton property every single year.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.660]   And there are a few hotels you can't use it at
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.420]   but it is very liberally used.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.220]   I've seen multiple reports of people using it
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.860]   at the Conrad and Bora Bora
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.300]   at really nice Waldorf Astorias.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.300]   And then you get another $250
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.780]   Hilton resort statement credit.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.220]   So if you're staying at any Hilton resort
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.420]   you can charge $250 to your room.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.420]   So if you add those up, it's like 250 airline credit,
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.820]   250 resort credit, a free night anywhere and diamond status.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.660]   It actually seemed like a pretty good deal
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.520]   for $450 a year, assuming you're gonna do that.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.780]   Not to mention after you spend $4,000
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.900]   you get 150,000 Hilton points.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.600]   So I don't have a link for that card.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.220]   There's no way that signing up for it will help all the hacks
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.660]   but it's definitely a card
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.700]   that I thought was actually pretty interesting
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.500]   that I'd overlooked in the past.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.860]   - Quick, small correction.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.180]   Amy listened to this episode and reminded me
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.880]   that she has a personal referral link
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.800]   for the Hilton Aspire since we opened it in her name.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.200]   So if you wanna sign up for that card
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.220]   and help her earn some Hilton points
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.080]   go to allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.260]   I know a lot of this is top of mind for all of you.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.260]   So I really hope this episode was helpful.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.420]   I'll put a link to the guide that Tal wrote up
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.300]   as well as a link to check out Gelt and the show notes.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.540]   And as always, if you have any feedback, questions
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.100]   or just wanna say hi, I'm Chris at allthehacks.com.
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.060]   Finally, I just wanna say thanks to the 60 or so people
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.320]   that came out to the event in San Francisco.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.880]   It was so great to meet some of the All The Hacks community.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.240]   Special shout out to Scott, Ali, and Akechi
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.880]   for flying out to the event.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.400]   That means the world to me.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.920]   And I look forward to doing more events
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.340]   like that in the future.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.860]   All right, see you next week.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:30.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
