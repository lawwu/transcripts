[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.040]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.740]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.880]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.080]   and every year as we get closer to December 31st,
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.400]   I start to make sure I've done all the right moves
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.700]   for my money, taxes, points, miles, and more.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.480]   So I thought I'd put together an episode
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.400]   to share with all of you what that actually means.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.640]   There is a lot of good content
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.100]   that I hope can help you all be more optimized this year.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.800]   And when it comes to all the tax topics,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.020]   I wanna give a big shout out to Tal Binder,
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.260]   the founder and CEO of Gelt, a tax planning company,
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.740]   that I was so impressed with when I met Tal
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.020]   and heard all of his tax knowledge
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.860]   that I knew I had to invest a small amount in the company.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.180]   And since then, I've become a paying customer
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.380]   of their services for my personal and business taxes.
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.500]   And Tal spent 90 minutes giving me feedback and advice
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.640]   for all the content in this episode, which was so helpful.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.620]   However, full disclosure, I am not an accountant or a CPA,
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.700]   so you shouldn't take anything I'm about to share
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.020]   as tax advice.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.240]   And if you do want tax advice, talk to your own accountant,
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.740]   or if you wanna check out Gelt,
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.060]   you can schedule a call with their team to learn more
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.060]   at allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.780]   Note that they are not a sponsor,
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.420]   that is not an affiliate link,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.960]   but Tal did say that he'd let anyone that comes
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.660]   from All The Hacks skip their wait list.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.740]   Okay, let's get into the episode right after this.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.460]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.780]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.940]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.960]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.900]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.340]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.180]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.820]   from Anyday, I am a total convert,
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.920]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.220]   for this episode.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.260]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.540]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.860]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code,
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.880]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.500]   The cookware is 100% plastic free,
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.460]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.620]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.820]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.440]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.620]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.920]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.260]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.300]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday,

[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.420]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.580]   All right, since so much of year-end financial planning
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.900]   is tax-related, I'm gonna start there,
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.160]   but I figured it would be good to set a tone
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.700]   for some of the principles of how I think about this.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.040]   So my goal is not to break the rules
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.520]   or even bend the rules.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.440]   I'm really trying to play as squarely
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.560]   in the rules as possible, but within those rules,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.160]   I would love to avoid taxes if I could.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.640]   And if not, I'd love to at least minimize the taxes I do owe,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.040]   and finally, no matter what,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.880]   I'd love to defer those taxes out
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.700]   as far as I can in the future.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.520]   So that's kind of the overarching theme,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.560]   but let's get into the tactics.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.640]   Now, I realize some of you might have a small business
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.280]   or a side hustle, and there are so many great optimizations
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.840]   for business owners, but I'm gonna focus first
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.940]   on all the things that apply to everyone,
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.800]   including W-2 employees.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.720]   So first, I think it makes sense to talk about
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.460]   one of the biggest decisions that you make
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.580]   on your tax return, which is whether you're gonna take
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.000]   the standard deduction or you're gonna itemize.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.680]   So the way it kind of works is that the IRS
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.040]   gives you the ability to just say,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.000]   I want to take this one deduction
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.340]   and reduce my income by it and not do any extra homework.
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.520]   If you're single, it's 12,950.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.380]   If you're a joint filer, it's 25,900,
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.120]   and it's super straightforward.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.400]   Now, if you wanna itemize, you're basically saying,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.160]   I'm going to take all of my individual deductions,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.760]   add them up, and do that instead.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   Obviously, you wouldn't do those if they didn't exceed
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.120]   the amount of the standard deduction,
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.280]   but if they do, then obviously it'd be a better deal.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.640]   And so you can itemize things like charitable contributions,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.340]   state and local taxes up to a $10,000 limit,
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.120]   home mortgage interest, and then sometimes things like
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.880]   medical expenses, investment interest, gambling losses,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.420]   casualty losses, and things like that.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.700]   So if you're kind of on the line
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.440]   where you could go either way,
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.620]   one tactic you could do is bunch
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.420]   all of your itemized deductions
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.900]   by combining multiple years into one
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.360]   so that you can switch between the itemizing one year
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.340]   and the standard deduction the next year.
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.700]   So the way you could do that is you could donate
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.540]   all of the money you might wanna donate for two years
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.340]   to charity into one year,
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.300]   and you could either do that by donating to charities
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.940]   or using a donor advised fund, which we'll talk about later.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.080]   You could prepay your property tax a little early
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.720]   if you're not gonna be at that state and local tax limit.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.960]   You could prepay your January mortgage payment
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.280]   to try to get a little extra
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.000]   mortgage interest contribution in the year.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.400]   Or if you have any other qualifying expenses,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.000]   you could do those in one year.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.240]   And then the next year,
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.520]   you really try to limit all of those expenses
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.200]   so that you take the standard deduction.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.100]   And then the following year in January,
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.880]   you could play catch up and do it again
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.700]   and try to itemize more that year.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.060]   So that's one thing you can do if you're on the fence.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.260]   So effectively what you're doing
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.580]   is you're taking those expenses that you can itemize
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.660]   and you're either deferring them out
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.960]   or accelerating them in.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.080]   But you could do something similar with income.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.560]   It's not always as easy if you don't own a business
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.400]   where you could just say,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.440]   "Oh, I'm going to ask someone to pay me in January
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.140]   "instead of now, or ask someone to prepay me."
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.460]   But I do have one example recently,
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.180]   which was someone I know was laid off from their job
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.360]   and their employer told them,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.720]   "We would like to give you a severance
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.060]   "as soon as you return this document to us."
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.600]   And it happened in December.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.940]   And he asked how long he had to sign the document.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.460]   And they actually told him he could sign it any time
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.680]   before the end of the year.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.120]   And they would process that severance payment a week later.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.540]   So he actually waited so that next year
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.960]   he would get that severance payment
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   and have it come in the following tax year
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.520]   since he assumed he would likely be at a lower income
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.320]   'cause he didn't have a job right now.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.360]   So when you think about whether you're going to be making
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.860]   more or less income next year compared to this year,
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.580]   you can decide, does it make sense
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.160]   to try to defer some of that income or bring it in?
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.520]   So I mentioned charitable donations,
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.760]   but I wanna cover a few components of it.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.720]   So you probably know that if you donate money
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.400]   to a nonprofit, you can deduct that on your taxes.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.240]   Great.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.260]   But did you also know that any of the non-cash property
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.360]   you donate, whether it's clothes or electronics
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.720]   or anything you drop off at Goodwill is also a deduction.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.520]   And if you save the receipt they give you,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.700]   which is usually blank, and you fill it out,
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.120]   you can actually get a tax donation up to $5,000.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.000]   You just need to make sure you write down what you donated
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.160]   and you fill out a receipt so that you have something
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.800]   to have on hand in case you ever have questions
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.760]   down the road.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.400]   And if you're not sure of the amount,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.720]   definitely don't just put $5,000
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.480]   unless you want someone to ask questions.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.320]   I would try to put a number that's more accurate.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.400]   But one of the most effective things to donate
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.840]   is appreciated assets,
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.300]   because you can save even more when you give.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.120]   So let's take a stock you bought a long time ago for $100.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.960]   And let's say it's now worth $1,000.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.280]   When you sell that stock,
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.420]   you're gonna have to pay taxes on the $900 of gains.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.160]   Now, it's gonna be long-term cap gains,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.080]   but you're also gonna need to pay state taxes
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.120]   depending on where you live.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.680]   And in California, that could add up to like 33%.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.760]   So you've got $900 gain,
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.720]   you have to pay taxes on a third of it,
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.440]   you're gonna end up owing about $300.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.280]   Now, that means that at the end of the day,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.600]   you're actually gonna take home $700.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.880]   Now you could go donate that $700 to a charity
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.900]   and get a $700 deduction.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.000]   What you can also do is you can actually donate
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.260]   that $1,000 of stock.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.040]   You'll give the charity $1,000.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.120]   You'll get $1,000 deduction.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.880]   They'll get $1,000,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.120]   but you don't actually have to pay any capital gains tax.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.280]   So you never pay capital gains tax
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.140]   on the appreciated assets you donate,
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.080]   and you get the full tax deduction.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.320]   So that's a great option for giving to charity.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.400]   And we'll talk about the wash sale rule later,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.360]   but it turns out that best I understand it,
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.480]   you're not actually impacted by the wash sale rule
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.760]   when you donate to charity.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   So you could just buy that stock right away the next day
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.680]   and replace it if you really wanna hold it.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.640]   So if you own any appreciated assets,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.480]   you should probably not ever be donating to charity
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.480]   in any format other than those appreciated assets,
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.920]   because if you wanted to donate $1,000,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.120]   you're going to save money on taxes
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.400]   by donating $1,000 of appreciated securities
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.720]   versus donating $1,000 outright.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.560]   And if you were gonna donate the $1,000 anyways,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.800]   you could always just rebuy those securities.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.420]   Now, one of the things that makes this whole thing
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.240]   a little tricky is that donating appreciated securities
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.680]   is not as simple and quick and straightforward
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.360]   as just putting a credit card number
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.440]   on the donation widget on some charity's website.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.200]   However, one thing I love doing,
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.280]   and I know you've heard me talk about it a lot,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.480]   is setting up a donor advised fund.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.600]   So it's a charitable giving vehicle,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.560]   basically a fund that you create.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.300]   And when you donate to that fund,
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.040]   you're donating to a nonprofit
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.520]   and you're getting the tax deduction right away.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.240]   However, you're in control of where those funds go.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.360]   And so you can choose to divvy them out at a later date
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.440]   to any number of different organizations.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.420]   So you could donate $1,000 in 2022,
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.680]   and you could donate that from appreciated securities
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.780]   that would have actually only resulted in you having $700.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.760]   And then later in the future,
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.120]   you could donate $100 to one organization,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.560]   $500 to another.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.840]   You can kind of decide whenever you want.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.160]   And until you're ready to donate,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.040]   you can actually invest the funds
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.880]   in your donor advised fund
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.360]   so that the money still grows with market appreciation.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.760]   I think you've all heard me talk about Daffy before.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.920]   Daffy's how I manage my donor advised fund.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.480]   They're a partner of the show.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.940]   You can get $25 for free when you use them
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.280]   at allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.240]   I was using it before they partnered with us
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.840]   and I'll be using it long after
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.840]   if they ever stop partnering with the show.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.600]   So definitely check that out.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.360]   It's a great product.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.760]   Speaking of capital gains,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.340]   let's talk a little bit about tax loss harvesting.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.520]   You might have some stocks or index funds
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.200]   or other securities that you bought,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.800]   maybe even crypto at a price higher
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.080]   than what they're at today,
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.340]   which means you have a loss.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.560]   Now, when you sell that stock,
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.240]   you can actually capture that loss
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.640]   and use it to offset other gains
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.240]   or offset your income up to $3,000 a year.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.440]   So if you're sitting on losses right now
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.400]   before the end of the year
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.160]   and you have any capital gains,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.880]   it might be a really good opportunity
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.320]   to sell those securities
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.520]   so that you can use that loss
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.820]   to lower your tax liability for the year.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.080]   Now, if you don't have any capital gains to use,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.760]   you can still carry over that loss to future years
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.880]   and use it to offset future capital gains
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.320]   or even offset your income $3,000 a year at a time.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.800]   However, the wash sale rule
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.920]   is a really important factor here.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.580]   What it basically says is you can't sell a security,
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.200]   take a loss, and then rebuy that security for 30 days.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.300]   So that means if you have a loss on something,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.160]   but you actually wanna hold it as part of your portfolio,
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.440]   you can't just sell it and buy it back right away,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.000]   otherwise the loss gets offset
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.240]   and you actually don't get any of the benefit.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.280]   However, you can buy something that's very similar,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.440]   but not substantially identical.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.700]   So in the case of some common index fund pairing examples,
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.960]   you've got VTI,
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.920]   which is a total stock market index fund from Vanguard,
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.560]   but you also have ITOT,
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.920]   which is an iShares total stock market index fund,
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.000]   or you have Schwab's SCHB,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.560]   which is another US broad market index fund.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.440]   So obviously you could just sell something
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.000]   and not hold it for 30 days,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.560]   and you'd be exposed to whatever price changes happen
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.800]   over those 30 days,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.200]   but you also can buy something different.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.180]   Now, products like Wealthfront and other robo-advisors
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.640]   will do this automatically for you,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   but if you're managing your investments
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   in your own brokerage firm,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.860]   you can do this yourself.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.680]   You just have to sell things at a loss
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.040]   and not rebuy them for 30 days.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.080]   Because all my long-term investments are at Wealthfront,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.080]   I don't think about it, it happens automatically,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.400]   so I don't have to worry about it.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.360]   In fact, this year,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.600]   it looks like I've harvested over 10%
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.920]   of the value of my portfolio as losses
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.780]   I can use to offset gains,
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.740]   both in the portfolio and outside of it.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.760]   Now, I'm no longer a Wealthfront employee.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.960]   Amy, my wife, still does work at Wealthfront,
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.380]   but if you wanna get $5,000 managed free,
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.000]   you can use my personal referral link.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.440]   It's allthehacks.com/wealthfront.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   Now, when it comes to crypto,
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.000]   there's actually no wash sale rule
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.600]   because they're not securities.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.440]   So if you're holding any crypto tokens and they're down,
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.060]   you can sell them and then buy them right back
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.740]   and book that loss
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.740]   and be able to use that to offset any gains you have
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.160]   or $3,000 of income.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.400]   When it comes to crypto,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.040]   if you're in a situation like me,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.080]   where you have crypto that you have no ability to access
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.560]   because it was at Coinbase or FTX
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.000]   or any other projects that are kind of in the middle
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.360]   of either bankruptcy proceedings
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.700]   or you're trying to figure out what happens
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.200]   or withdrawals are paused,
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.560]   that's a different story.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.400]   I think right now, the best option
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.940]   and what I'm doing is just waiting.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.040]   You do have the ability,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.880]   if you're certain you're never getting anything back,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.160]   to take an abandonment loss.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.300]   That's something that I'm not familiar enough with
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.040]   to give you a lot of explanation.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.220]   But fortunately, the team at Gelt
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.660]   has written an entire little tax guide
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.560]   all about tax tips for a recession
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.060]   that includes things like abandonment
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.060]   or even small business stock losses.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.620]   So I'll include a link to the show notes to that guide
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.340]   where there's a lot more detail there,
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.480]   but that's just something to consider as well.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.860]   I wanna tell you all about the most amazing way
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.220]   to buy a second home.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.260]   And I know because we actually bought one
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.120]   for one eighth the cost.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.240]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares,
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.880]   I'm talking about Picasso
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.400]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.360]   So how does it work?
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.740]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.240]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   creates an LLC for each home
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.280]   and you can buy as little as one eighth of the property.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.600]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.480]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   handling design, cleaning, bills, repairs, taxes and more.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.460]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.740]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.400]   When we found Picasso, it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.520]   That same week we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.460]   we toured it and the next week we were closing.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.900]   Since then, it's truly become our second home
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.500]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.820]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.220]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.500]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.680]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resale in 12 days
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.040]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.280]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.360]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.880]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.560]   which means you can see new listings
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.360]   before they go on the website
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.440]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.520]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picassopasso.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.000]   P-A-C-A-S-S-O.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.880]   I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.000]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.600]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.480]   So I love having an easy way
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.680]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.560]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.680]   and I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   I started taking it because I wanted to see
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.960]   what all the hype was about
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.080]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.480]   Every morning I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.600]   add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.840]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.200]   and energized for the day,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.960]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.320]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.840]   minerals, and superfoods,
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.620]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.080]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.780]   or artificial anything.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.560]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.080]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.000]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.400]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.440]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.480]   to take ownership over your health
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.840]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.400]   Another opportunity if you have some gains this year,
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.640]   but you don't have any losses to offset them,
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.040]   is to look into Opportunity Zone Investing.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.000]   If you make an investment into a Qualified Opportunity Zone,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.040]   and these are certain types of real estate investments,
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   and I'm certainly not the expert here,
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.600]   I'm just sharing what I've learned,
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.220]   you actually can defer capital gains
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.000]   by reinvesting those gains
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.640]   into a Qualified Opportunity Zone,
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.600]   which is usually areas of a city that are lower income,
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.720]   and you're investing in real estate projects there.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.280]   Obviously, that comes with significantly more risk
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.840]   than just harvesting losses from your securities,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.760]   but it is one way to defer capital gains into the future.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.260]   And then on the topic of investment,
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.240]   let's talk a little bit about a few other things
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.080]   you could do before the end of the year.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.800]   One that I love is iBonds.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.280]   They're Series I savings bonds issued by the US government,
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.760]   and they peg the interest rate to inflation.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.880]   And so how it works is they lock an interest rate in
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.740]   for six months, and then it changes every six months.
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.020]   Currently, the interest rate is 6.89%.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.440]   You do have to keep your money in there
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.800]   for at least one year,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.300]   and if you take your money out in less than five years,
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.940]   you lose the last three months of your interest.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.020]   But there are very few places you can go
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.440]   to earn 6% or more that I'm aware of,
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.480]   and so one option before the end of the year
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.460]   is to invest in iBonds.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.820]   You can only invest $10,000 per person or entity.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.280]   So you could put in 10,000 for you, your spouse,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.420]   you could put it in for your kids,
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.300]   or you could even put it in for a trust.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.820]   So that's something that, as long as you do it before April,
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.900]   you lock in the 6.89% for the first six months.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.700]   I don't know what inflation will look like
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.540]   when it comes to reevaluating that interest rate in April,
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.280]   but whatever the new rate that comes out then will be,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.740]   you'll be subject to that rate for the next six months,
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.420]   and then you can kind of wait and see
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.580]   what the rate is in the future
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.940]   and decide whether it makes sense to take anything out.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.840]   To do that, you have to go to treasurydirect.gov.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.460]   Unfortunately, it is a really terrible website
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.900]   built by the US government.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.660]   It's messy and not great, but it works, it's functional,
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.520]   and I was able to use it pretty easily.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.440]   It just looks like I was using something
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.700]   from 10 years ago.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.340]   While we're still talking about investments,
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.180]   if you work at a company and you've been issued
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.980]   any stock options that are ISOs or incentive stock options,
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.940]   usually the problem with exercising them
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.020]   is it generates a certain amount of income,
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.900]   but not income the way your taxes are normally calculated,
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.580]   income that's only subject
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.940]   to what's called the alternative minimum tax.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.580]   And I won't go into too much detail here,
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.860]   but basically the IRS says
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.540]   there's two ways to calculate your taxes,
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.220]   and if you owe more one way than you do the other way,
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.560]   we use that one.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.800]   You can, if you're not already subject to AMT,
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.120]   with the help of an accountant,
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.320]   I wouldn't necessarily try to do this yourself,
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.800]   you could figure out the amount of ISOs you can exercise
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.040]   that won't put you into that limit,
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   and it might allow you to exercise some of your stock
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.640]   without any tax implications a little earlier.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.520]   Obviously, you have to pay to do the exercising,
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.280]   but you wouldn't have to pay the extra taxes that year.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.960]   Finally, retirement accounts.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.440]   You don't necessarily have to do
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.120]   all of the retirement contributions
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.340]   before the end of the year.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.700]   Things like IRAs and solo 401ks,
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.420]   you actually have until April,
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.620]   or in some cases October if you file an extension.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.580]   But if you haven't contributed to your 401k,
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.960]   and you can use your last paycheck
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.060]   before the end of the year,
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.380]   by the time this comes out, that's an option.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.780]   I always try to just do all of my contributing
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.720]   in the calendar tax year, not that it's necessary.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.780]   So that's contributing to any retirement accounts
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.580]   outside of your 401k,
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.500]   or contributing to a backdoor Roth contribution,
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.980]   which is most people that have a W-2 job
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.920]   aren't eligible for contributing to a traditional
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.220]   or a Roth IRA if you are great.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.800]   But if not, and I'll encourage you to Google around
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.560]   for backdoor Roth IRAs,
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.960]   but you can contribute to a traditional IRA,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.500]   even if you're not eligible for the tax deductibility of it,
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.840]   you can make a non-deductible contribution,
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.180]   and then you can roll that non-deductible contribution
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.760]   over into a Roth IRA.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.800]   Why the IRS has come out and said that this is okay,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.080]   but not just made it easy to do directly
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.440]   is beyond me, so are many things in the tax code.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.560]   One thing I will say is,
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.220]   if you already have traditional IRA investments,
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.920]   it can get really complicated
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   because you can't just choose which funds you roll over.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.000]   So definitely, if you're in that situation,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.820]   talk to an accountant before thinking about
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.600]   doing any backdoor Roth IRAs.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.300]   And depending on your tax situation this year
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.540]   relative to next year,
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.400]   you could consider doing a Roth conversion,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.760]   which is taking any of your pre-tax retirement accounts
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.600]   and converting them to Roth accounts.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.240]   Whether they're traditional 401ks or IRAs,
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.460]   you can roll them over into a Roth account,
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.240]   which then means you don't have to pay any taxes
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.280]   on the gains in those accounts
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.880]   as long as you take them out in retirement.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.240]   So that's an option.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   It will result in you owing taxes for that conversion.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.320]   So it wouldn't be a great idea
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.400]   if 2022 was a really high tax year for you,
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.800]   but if you weren't in that situation,
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.240]   it could be something worth considering
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.160]   before the end of the year.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.640]   If you have kids and you wanna contribute to a 529
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.080]   for their educational expenses or say for their college,
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.920]   that's something you can do up to $16,000 a year per child.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.040]   Technically, it's actually from each individual
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.100]   to another individual.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.600]   So if a couple wanted to gift it to two kids,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.860]   it would be each person giving to each kid.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.400]   So you could actually gift 32,000 per person.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.560]   So that's something you could do.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.040]   If you wanted to super fund the 529,
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.020]   if you haven't done that,
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.220]   you can bulk give up to five years at once.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.760]   So depending on your state,
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.600]   you may or may not get a little bit of tax break
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.620]   for putting money in,
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.460]   but the IRS doesn't give you any breaks.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.080]   And I know in California, you don't,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.640]   but that money does get to grow tax-free
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.200]   as long as you are using it
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.440]   for a qualified educational expense, which is college.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.960]   And now it's actually expanded to even include things
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.460]   like private school and a few other things.
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.360]   And it's not tied to one person.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.680]   So if you don't use it all up,
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.880]   you can pass it down to other children or grandchildren.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.440]   And there's even some stipulations
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.360]   that if your child gets a scholarship,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.360]   the fees to withdraw from and get waived.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.400]   When it comes to some of your employer benefits,
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.080]   definitely make sure that you've used up any of the money
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.800]   in your FSA accounts or transit accounts
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.060]   before the end of the year.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.720]   There's a few different types of accounts.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.000]   The most common I've seen is FSAs for medical expenses.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.920]   And while you can usually roll over a small amount
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.840]   of hundreds of dollars,
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.920]   depending on your employer's plan rules,
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.880]   you usually have to spend all of the money
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.600]   in those accounts before the end of the year.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.140]   So if you have leftover funds,
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.840]   a few options, there are always things you could go buy
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.080]   before the end of the year.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.400]   There are products and services like blood tests,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.600]   genetic tests, new baby monitor, thermometers,
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.160]   those kinds of things are all eligible expenses.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.620]   So that's something I've done in the past.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.520]   Or if there's really nothing you need,
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.360]   you can always reach out to a local shelter or charity,
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.880]   see if there's anything that they need
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.560]   and you could go buy it for them.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.840]   If you have a dependent care FSA,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.920]   just make sure you submit those expenses.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.460]   And then with HSAs, it's actually not something
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.580]   that you have to use it or lose it.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.980]   So I wouldn't feel any stress.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.900]   In fact, HSAs are really cool
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.500]   because you put money in tax-free,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.460]   the money grows tax-free and you take it out tax-free.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.120]   So there's a pretty strong argument
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.740]   to not take your money out from your HSA now.
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.860]   But if you haven't maxed out the contributions
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.220]   and you want to, you can put up to $3,650
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.260]   in if you have individual coverage
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.000]   or $7,300 if you have family coverage.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.860]   When I say coverage, that means covered
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.640]   by a high deductible health plan.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.740]   If you weren't covered by a high deductible health plan
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.700]   in 2022, then you can't contribute to an HSA.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.140]   But if you haven't maxed that out,
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.180]   that is something you could do before the end of the year.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.700]   Okay, this one's not that big,
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.380]   but there are some tax benefits
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.420]   for energy efficiency upgrades that you can make
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.700]   before the end of the year.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.140]   So any home improvements you've made
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.100]   might be eligible for a tax credit.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.660]   The tax credit in 2022 is equal to 10%
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.940]   of the cost of those improvements.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.040]   That means windows, doors, insulation, roofs,
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.840]   heat pumps, water heaters, furnaces.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.280]   The only catch is that the total credit
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.740]   is up to $500 in your lifetime.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.160]   And it's like 300 for building property,
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.160]   200 for window components.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.920]   So it's not a massive credit,
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.680]   but if you this year invested in any of those things,
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.560]   central air units, I know we put in a new hot water heater
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.520]   that broke and we put in air conditioning.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.160]   So I think that might actually get us to that $500 maximum.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.320]   Also, if you did invest in solar,
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.560]   you can usually get up to about 30% back
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.840]   in those investments.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.080]   The only catch there is that that must be in service
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.160]   by the end of the year.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.640]   So if you haven't done this,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.520]   it's probably really unlikely
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.120]   that it's going to be something that you're able to do
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.100]   in the next couple of days.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.000]   And then finally, if you purchased
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.200]   or if you somehow are able to purchase
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.260]   and take possession of an electric vehicle
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.120]   that was assembled in the US before the end of the year,
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.520]   you might be able to save up to $7,500
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.680]   of the cost in taxes for the EV tax credit in 2022.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.040]   So one tax optimization I've heard a few people talk about
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.080]   is that businesses have so many more opportunities
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.880]   to be more tax efficient
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.760]   because of the rules and regulations we have in this country
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.240]   that you could try to get your employer to hire you
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.000]   as a business instead of as a W2 employee.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.360]   Actually talked a bit about this with Tal.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.400]   And while it is possible,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.960]   there are a few really important things to consider.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.120]   One, you can't just take your job and convert it right away
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.200]   and expect the IRS to let that be okay
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.760]   unless you really change something about the way you operate.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.680]   If you're a designer
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.600]   and you convert from an employee to a contractor
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.720]   and you take on three or four other clients
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.320]   as a design agency, that might make sense.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.880]   But if you just have one client
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.400]   and you're getting paid about the same amount
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.780]   and you just switch the type,
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.940]   it's unlikely that's going to hold up.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.440]   So if you are actually changing the style of business,
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.600]   you operate great.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.860]   However, one really important thing to consider
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.280]   is that it is so much harder to get approved for loans,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.920]   especially mortgages, when you're not a W2 employee.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.800]   When I was talking to Tal,
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.240]   he's seen clients who even have over a million dollars
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.040]   of income a year struggle to get approved for a mortgage.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.880]   I think I'd always heard
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.760]   that that was such an awesome opportunity,
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.060]   but kind of understanding that you really fundamentally
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.560]   need to change how you operate
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.400]   and some of the stresses it might put on you
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.080]   if you're trying to buy a home,
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.640]   I don't think it's really worth it
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.140]   for anyone who's not actually running a business.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.360]   However, if you are running a business,
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.780]   there are a handful of tax optimizations to think about.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.880]   One is doing an S-corp election,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.900]   which makes it a little bit more efficient
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.320]   for some types of businesses.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.560]   Obviously, for all of these,
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.840]   you should be talking to an accountant
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.040]   and not just taking anything I say as advice,
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.600]   but it will help you avoid some of the Social Security
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.680]   and Medicare taxes that you would pay
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.940]   on your individual income if you weren't an S-corp.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.840]   There's the home office deduction.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.400]   And one cool thing I learned recently
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.320]   is that you don't necessarily have to allocate your home
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.240]   by a percentage of square feet.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.160]   You might be able to allocate it by a percentage of rooms.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.880]   So if you have seven rooms in your house
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   and your office is one of them,
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.640]   maybe you could use one seventh instead of square foot.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.000]   The meal deduction, which actually for this year,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.560]   you can deduct 100% of meals.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.760]   And what is a business meeting in a pandemic world?
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.880]   If you're doing a virtual meeting over Zoom
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.620]   and having lunch over that meeting,
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.120]   I think there's an argument to be made
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.880]   that that's also a business meal.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.840]   There's qualified business income,
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.120]   which is something you should talk to an accountant about.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.440]   If you have kids and there's really any argument
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.000]   that those kids are doing work for the business,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.920]   whether they're old enough to actually do work
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.560]   or whether they're young enough to maybe just be models
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.120]   in photos that you put on your company's website,
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.560]   you can hire your children.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.520]   And one of the coolest things about doing this
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.640]   is that if your children have income,
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.040]   which also means, by the way, they have to file their taxes,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.440]   but they can contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.360]   And so if you think about being able to put money
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.240]   into an account for your kids when they're very young
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.160]   and letting that compound for 60 plus years,
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.760]   it could be really, really impactful on their future.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.600]   There's also bonus depreciation,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.240]   which is if you buy something like a car
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.320]   that weighs over 6,000 pounds,
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.920]   then you can actually accelerate the depreciation
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.840]   all in one year.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.480]   Obviously that car has to be for business purposes.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.960]   There's a bunch of interesting optimizations
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.520]   when it comes to self-employed retirement plans,
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.880]   SEP IRAs, solo 401ks,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.000]   where you can actually contribute more
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   than the amount you could contribute to your 401k
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.960]   as an employee at a company.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.200]   There's also countless different expenses
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.840]   that qualify as business expenses.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.320]   So if you're taking a course,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.400]   if you're paying an annual fee on your business credit card,
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.920]   if you're buying anything that you use for work.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.960]   So there's really a lot of stuff here.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   I just use it to highlight some of the things
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.920]   you should use to go start a conversation
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.000]   with your accountant,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.360]   not anything that you should take as advice.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.720]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.240]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.800]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.240]   in your situation,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.840]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.120]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.980]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.760]   with backgrounds in everything from technology, finance,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.640]   medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.040]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.320]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.480]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.840]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.560]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.360]   are first generation wealth,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.440]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.560]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.920]   and learn from each other
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.520]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.800]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.120]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.560]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.720]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.680]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.160]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.600]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.960]   to your children's education,
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.240]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.720]   So many of these conversations
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.920]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.600]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.440]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.560]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.680]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.840]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.320]   And if you choose to apply,

[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.360]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.600]   This holiday season, I wanna give gifts to my loved ones
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.600]   that make them feel special and unique,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.920]   just like the relationships we share.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.200]   If you feel the same way,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.920]   you should be giving them StoryWorth,
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.360]   which is an incredible gift
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.120]   I've given to the people I care about,
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.440]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.240]   StoryWorth is an online service
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.960]   that helps you and your loved ones preserve
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.000]   precious memories and stories for years to come.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.920]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.240]   that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.000]   Each week, StoryWorth emails your relative or friend
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.240]   a thought-provoking question of your choice
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.280]   from a vast pool of options.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.120]   Each unique prompt asks a question
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.400]   you've never thought about,
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done,
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.200]   or if you could see into the future,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.280]   what would you want to find out?
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.440]   After a year, StoryWorth will compile
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.040]   all of your loved one's stories,
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.120]   including photos, into a beautiful keepsake book
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.880]   that you'll be able to share and revisit
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.320]   for generations to come,
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.800]   which, now that we have kids,
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.120]   I couldn't be more excited
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.800]   to start collecting these books to share with them.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   Reading the weekly stories helps connect you
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.160]   with loved ones no matter how near or far apart you are,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.520]   and you'll be surprised at the things you learn,
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.080]   like how my dad might have gotten into trouble
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.800]   for landing a helicopter at Denny's
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.600]   back when he was in the military.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.160]   With StoryWorth, I'm giving those I love most
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.200]   a thoughtful, personal gift from the heart
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.160]   and preserving their memories and stories
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.560]   for years to come.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.720]   Go to allthehacks.com/storyworth

[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.400]   I just want to thank you, Quik,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.720]   for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.360]   Okay, that covers most of the year-end stuff
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.440]   related to taxes, but there are a few other year-end things
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.400]   that I want to talk about
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.680]   that are mostly about points and miles.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.320]   But before I get to them, I do also want to make sure
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.240]   I cover a few of the interesting things that I learned
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.640]   that I'm actually going to put into place next year
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.360]   because I think they're relevant,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.040]   and just because you can't use them this year
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.160]   doesn't mean you might not want to start
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.040]   thinking about them.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.640]   So first off, when it comes to the HSA and FSA stuff,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.400]   I'm actively thinking about things
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.720]   that I might want to do next year
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.080]   so I can make those elections
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.000]   and decide how much to contribute.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.880]   I'm definitely going to want to do some blood work
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.480]   that probably won't get covered.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.080]   I'm considering whether I want to do the GRAIL test,
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.960]   which is an early pre-screening test for cancer
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.080]   with blood work that's in the hundreds of dollars range.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.920]   And because of the cancer in my family history,
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.680]   I just want to start thinking about those kinds of things.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.200]   The other one is the Augusta rule,
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.800]   which funny enough is actually created
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.920]   to protect the residents of Augusta, Georgia,
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.160]   who rented out their homes
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.360]   to attendees of the Masters Golf Tournament.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.520]   But it basically says that you can rent out your home
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.480]   for up to 14 nights a year
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.200]   without needing to report any of that rental income
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.680]   on your tax return.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.720]   So if you've been considering renting out your place
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.200]   on Airbnb while you're traveling, while you're out of town,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.320]   but really only for a couple weeks,
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.800]   this is a really great opportunity
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.060]   to bring in some extra income with no tax consequences.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.460]   Obviously, it's maybe possible for you to do this
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.880]   before the end of the year,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.360]   but it's probably unlikely given the time of year.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.280]   But it is something that I might start thinking about
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.400]   for next year if we have one or two trips planned.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.920]   One cool hack that I've been shared by a few people
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.440]   is if you have a business,
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.720]   you can actually have your business rent your home
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.680]   to use it for things.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.020]   So if I were gonna do a film shoot in the house,
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.560]   the business could rent the home from me,
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.160]   and I would in effect be able to pay with company funds
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.320]   to my personal without having to pay taxes,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.820]   so it makes it really efficient for transferring money
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.220]   from the business to yourself without any tax consequences.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.080]   Obviously, this only works if you're actually using it
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.980]   for those purposes.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.600]   So if you're actually making videos,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.580]   there's a lot of good evidence that you're doing so
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.720]   because you have video evidence of that.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.020]   But I don't think this is the kind of thing
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.860]   that I would test out if it wasn't actually true.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.540]   Finally, the last thing I've been thinking about
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.340]   is whether I add more California muni bonds
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.780]   to my investment portfolio.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.860]   Obviously, there are muni bonds in every state,
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.020]   but muni bonds happen to be triple tax-free
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.800]   from federal, state, and local income,
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.660]   and with taxes in California where they are
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.980]   and interest rates where they are,
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.580]   it seems like something that I might increase
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.420]   the allocation to in my investment portfolio next year.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.900]   That's a lot about taxes.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.440]   I just wanna talk about some of the end of the year things
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.400]   you should be thinking about
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.540]   when it comes to your points and your miles.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.580]   So first off, I always try to make sure
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.160]   that at least once every year,
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.780]   I'm looking at all my accounts
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.100]   to figure out whether any of them have balances
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.400]   that are gonna expire.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.480]   If you have points related to a credit card,
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.100]   then I wouldn't really need to worry about this
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.700]   because you're probably accumulating
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.880]   at least some number of points each month,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.500]   and almost all mileage accounts,
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.380]   not all, but almost all, will not expire
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.720]   as long as there's some activity in the account.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.380]   Hotel points seem to expire more frequently than airlines.
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.800]   There are a lot of airlines that have shifted
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.420]   to no expiration dates,
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.680]   but it's really easy to keep things from expiring,
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.980]   especially with hotels.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.300]   Sometimes my wife and I just transfer points
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.320]   between each other,
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.300]   because a lot of hotel chains allow that for free,
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.460]   and that extends the life of the points.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.380]   On airlines, there are a lot of airlines
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.580]   that no longer have expiration dates,
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.500]   but if they do, there are some simple things you can do,
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.180]   whether it's using their shopping portal
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.640]   to make a small purchase,
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.020]   whether it's buying a nominal amount of points,
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.340]   or you could donate a nominal amount of points,
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.980]   or you can redeem a small number of points
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.560]   for a magazine subscription.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.600]   Really, any activity in your account
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.380]   will keep those balances active.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.100]   Okay, when it comes to status at the end of the year,
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.760]   yes, if you're chasing status,
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.880]   whether it's on an airline,
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.780]   or whether it's on a hotel chain,
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.260]   you can always consider whether you wanna make a mileage run
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.460]   or a mattress run.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.300]   This is where, let's say,
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.560]   you just need an extra four flight segments
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.200]   before the end of the year to hit a certain level of status.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.900]   You could actually just buy a ticket
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.260]   wherever the cheapest place to go is with one layover.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.180]   It might be San Francisco to Los Angeles to Las Vegas,
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.140]   back to Los Angeles, back to San Francisco.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.540]   And I haven't really ever been too heavy
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.540]   on the mileage runs,
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.140]   but there was one year where I remember flying to San Diego,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.260]   getting off and getting right back on the same plane
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.540]   to come back to San Francisco
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.300]   because I was just like 800 miles short
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.800]   of hitting that next level of United status.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.500]   On hotels, you can do the same thing.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.960]   You could book a night at a really cheap hotel,
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.940]   go stay there.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.400]   You do need to show up,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.900]   but you don't necessarily need to stay there the whole time.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.380]   So if you're three nights away from status,
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.880]   you could book a really cheap Marriott property,
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.940]   go check in, ruffle up the bed sheets,
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.980]   put on the do not disturb, and then head back home.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.620]   I haven't really in the most recent years
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.420]   found status to be that valuable
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.940]   that I really wanna go to those extents,
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.380]   but I totally 10 years ago was doing this.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.460]   So another big thing to do before the end of the year
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.980]   is if you have Delta or Marriott status,
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.980]   you might have some choice benefits,
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.460]   which with Delta, I think if you hit platinum or diamond,
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.220]   and with Marriott, if you hit platinum or titanium,
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.460]   you basically get some benefits
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.620]   that you have to select before the end of the year.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.100]   Things like suite upgrades or premier upgrades
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.060]   or free lounge access passes and things like that.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.780]   So I would definitely go and make sure you do that
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.920]   before the end of the year.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.720]   Also, there are some hotel chains
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.580]   that give you free night certificates.
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.980]   Not all of them are tied to the calendar year,
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.120]   but definitely go and make sure
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.940]   that if you have any free night certificates,
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.980]   you book them or even maybe use them
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.860]   before the end of the year if you need to.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.260]   Then a lot of credit cards
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.500]   have a bunch of different types of credits.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.580]   Some of them are tied to the calendar year
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.860]   and some of them are tied to the card member year.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.000]   I'll run through all of them for the sake of comprehension,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.060]   but the most important ones,
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.260]   'cause it's December, are the annual ones.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.020]   So on a bunch of Amex cards,
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.020]   platinum, gold, and the Hilton Aspire,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.640]   you have an airline credit.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.880]   Whether that's $100 or $200 or $250,
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.000]   basically the credit card is gonna reimburse you
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.700]   for purchases on airlines
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.660]   and you need to use that before the end of the year.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.300]   You actually need to select your airline first
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.820]   and you can actually only have one airline selected.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.740]   I have had some success in the past
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.940]   live chatting with Amex on their app or on the website
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.820]   and asking them to make a switch.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.020]   They're unlikely to do it multiple times throughout the year,
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.580]   but if you don't ask every year,
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.200]   they're usually willing to do it.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.140]   And there are some really great threads on Flyertalk
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.140]   if you want to learn about some of the creative ways
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.080]   to take advantage of those airline credits,
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.620]   because they're intentionally not supposed to be
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.420]   for buying flights, but for certain airlines,
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.500]   there are ways for those credits to be used
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.860]   to maybe buy a travel bank credit or a small cheap ticket,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.420]   or you could pay for part of your ticket with a gift card
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.660]   and the incremental amount gets coded as an upsell
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.660]   instead of as a ticket.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.700]   So that's something to go look at.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.120]   There's also another few cards, the City Prestige,
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.220]   the Chase Ritz-Carlton, the Bank of America Premium Rewards
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.420]   that have annual credits
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.840]   that I think are a little easier to use,
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.860]   but that expire at the end of the year.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.020]   There are a few other credits.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.860]   The Platinum card has a $200 prepaid hotel credit.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.460]   There's a $200 Dell credit that expires for a Platinum card,
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.860]   depending on whether you've used that before.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.980]   The Platinum card has a bunch of other credits
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.740]   that are worth making sure you've used.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.780]   There's the $200 prepaid hotel credit
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.900]   that you use booking an Amex travel.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.220]   There's a $200 Dell credit that I actually used
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.960]   to buy the original microphone to kick off this podcast.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.180]   I've used it a long time ago,
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.820]   but that's one that is on a calendar year schedule.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.260]   There's your $50 every six months SAX credit
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.300]   if you haven't used.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.180]   Two suggestions of how I've used it in the past.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.180]   We don't really like to buy fancy soap,
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.780]   but we've used our SAX credit to buy Aesop soap,
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.820]   and it's just really great soap.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.660]   I also just bought a couple pairs of Mack Weldon underwear,
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.180]   which are maybe a little expensive,
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.320]   but very comfortable and free if you use your SAX credit.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.820]   There's also the Uber credit, a $15 every month,
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.920]   but it's actually $35 in December,
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.760]   so definitely make sure you use that.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.940]   We almost always use it for Uber Eats,
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.020]   but you can use it for Uber as well.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.040]   And then finally, each month,
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.540]   there's the digital entertainment credit
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.420]   on the Platinum card,
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.540]   which you can use for things like SiriusXM,
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.020]   or New York Times, and other streaming services.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.720]   The Amex Gold has smaller credits.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.260]   They've got $10 a month dining,
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.180]   and $10 a month Uber.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.840]   Those aren't really annual because they're monthly,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.140]   but just reminder if you're not using them.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.260]   Similarly, Chase has the DoorDash credit
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.360]   on the Chase Reserve,
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.000]   and a GoPuff credit on literally every Chase card.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.700]   Those are credits that are tied to the month
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.020]   that just reminders to use.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.980]   On the card member year credits,
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.040]   those are things like on the Venture X,
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.940]   you get a $300 a year travel credit.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.820]   On the Chase Reserve,
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.780]   you get a $300 a year travel credit.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.020]   Those credits are on the cycle of cardholder year.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.200]   So whenever you open the card,
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.860]   you have a year to use them.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.400]   The Chase credit's really easy to use.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.780]   You just have to spend on travel,
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.420]   and it automatically gets used.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.260]   On the Venture X one,
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.700]   you have to go into the portal and book something.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.100]   The Chase Sapphire Preferred card
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.540]   also has a $50 hotel credit when you book in their portal.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.740]   And then finally, the Hilton Aspire card
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:02.460]   has a $250 resort credit at Hilton Properties.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.060]   If you notice, I mentioned the Hilton Aspire card
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.900]   a few times.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.820]   It's only because I recently looked into this card,
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.620]   and we actually signed up for it.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.700]   The reason we looked at it was,
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.060]   it's actually, I think, a pretty good deal
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.020]   for someone who's staying at Hilton's or traveling a lot.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.660]   It does have a high annual fee of $450,
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.180]   but you get complimentary diamond status,
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.980]   which is their top tier status with free breakfast.
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.980]   You get a $250 airline credit
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.040]   that if you're able to use,
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.320]   reduces that annual fee to $200.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.820]   You get an annual free night at a Hilton property
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.020]   every single year.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.220]   And there are a few hotels you can't use it at,
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.940]   but it is very liberally used.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.780]   I've seen multiple reports of people using it
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.420]   at the Conrad and Bora Bora,
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.820]   at really nice Waldorf Astorias.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.820]   And then you get another $250
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.300]   Hilton resort statement credit.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.740]   So if you're staying at any Hilton resort,
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.940]   you can charge $250 to your room.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.300]   So if you add those up,
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.380]   it's like 250 airline credit, 250 resort credit,
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.340]   a free night anywhere, and diamond status.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.580]   It actually seemed like a pretty good deal for $450 a year,
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.060]   assuming you're gonna do that.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.340]   Not to mention after you spend $4,000,
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.460]   you get 150,000 Hilton points.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.140]   So I don't have a link for that card.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.780]   There's no way that signing up for it
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.760]   will help All The Hacks,
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.180]   but it's definitely a card
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.220]   that I thought was actually pretty interesting
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.020]   that I'd overlooked in the past.
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.380]   - Quick, small correction.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.700]   Amy listened to this episode and reminded me
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.420]   that she has a personal referral link
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.340]   for the Hilton Aspire since we opened it in her name.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.740]   So if you wanna sign up for that card
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.780]   and help her earn some Hilton points,
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.620]   go to allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.820]   I know a lot of this is top of mind for all of you,
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.800]   so I really hope this episode was helpful.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.940]   I'll put a link to the guide that Tal wrote up,
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.820]   as well as a link to check out Gelt and the show notes.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.060]   And as always, if you have any feedback, questions,
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.660]   or just wanna say hi, I'm Chris at allthehacks.com.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:49.620]   Finally, I just wanna say thanks to the 60 or so people
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.860]   that came out to the event in San Francisco.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.420]   It was so great to meet some of the All The Hacks community.
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.740]   Special shout out to Scott, Ali, and Akechi
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.420]   for flying out to the event.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.940]   That means the world to me,
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.460]   and I look forward to doing more events
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.900]   like that in the future.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.420]   All right, see you next week.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:21.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
