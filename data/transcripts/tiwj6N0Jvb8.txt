[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   put in a little bit of effort and you could be flying first class for next to nothing.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.040]   And that is a pretty fantastic feeling.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.640]   Why do you like points?
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.600]   They make travel possible in ways that cash doesn't always make practical.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.280]   Then you feel like you're not paying for it.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.040]   Getting the champagne and the caviar and the onboard chef or the shower.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.640]   It certainly feels pretty incredible.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.280]   I spend less money, but I get far more vacations and far more comfortable experiences.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.160]   Of course, you have to know about transferring the points and booking it,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.240]   but all of those things are very learnable.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.080]   We're going to walk you through that entire process.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.520]   You'll have plenty of opportunities to travel around the world using monopoly money to pay
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.560]   for the ticket because you're like, "Oh, I don't want to bother with this."
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.840]   Then you may be giving up $1,000 in value.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.160]   And with a little bit of effort, look at that, you saved yourself 80% of the points.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.200]   So I often tell people that if you want to travel more, you need one of three things in abundance.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.640]   So the first thing, obvious money.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640]   If you've got millions and millions of dollars, easy to travel.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.520]   Number two is millions and millions of miles and points.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.560]   Those two things are difficult for most people to get more of.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.400]   The third thing that influences your ability to travel more is...
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.720]   Nick, thanks for being here.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.920]   Happy to be here.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.560]   I'm excited.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.320]   Yeah, I am really excited for this conversation.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.320]   I've had a bunch of times in the past in the show where we've talked about
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.720]   different ways to redeem points, get the most value.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.280]   But I wanted to do an end-to-end.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.840]   And I was talking with Greg, who is your partner on the Frequent Miler on the Air podcast.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.400]   And he was like, "Get Nick on. Nick is the pro."
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.400]   So this is going to be fun.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.520]   I'm glad.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.240]   I'm glad he said that.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.720]   I'll make sure to send that check in the mail.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.680]   Greg, it's out there, right?
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.720]   If you're listening.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.600]   Of course you're listening.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.100]   Yeah.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.240]   So I guess the thing I want to start us with is the premise of a conversation
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.680]   about redeeming your points and getting the most value out of them when you're traveling
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.000]   is that points even make sense.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.720]   So why do you like points?
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.880]   Why aren't you sitting there collecting cash back?
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.560]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.080]   I really think there's kind of like two different pieces to this.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.160]   So the first piece is that they make travel possible in ways that cash doesn't always
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.040]   make practical.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.920]   So I can almost guarantee that anybody who's not focusing right now on earning miles and
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.840]   points could be traveling more or more comfortably or both if they're learning to maximize miles
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.320]   and points.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.160]   So that's definitely a big piece of it.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.680]   The other big piece of it for me is that it's kind of a psychological thing.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.360]   I think we all like getting a deal, right?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.960]   Like stores have clearance sales and Black Friday sales and flash sales because they
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.360]   know that we get excited about saving something, right?
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.680]   And so if you've ever had that experience that high, getting 10 or 20 or 30 or 50% off
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.120]   on a pair of shoes or a TV or whatever, then you know what that feels like.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.160]   And the thing with miles and points is that that discount is often significantly higher.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.280]   So we're looking at saving 60 or 70 or sometimes like, believe it or not, 90% or more.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.600]   Often the cash price is something.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.440]   And so that takes things that are just impossible and brings them within reach.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.840]   Last year, I took my family of four to Europe three times and we flew in business class
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   both ways.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.160]   And that's something that I wouldn't have the cash to be able to do.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.640]   And even if I focused on cash back, I couldn't possibly earn enough cash back to be able
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.680]   to make that happen.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.600]   But miles and points create these opportunities for far outsized value.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.760]   And that's exciting and fun.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.600]   When you get on a plane and you know that you paid 90% less than somebody else on that
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.440]   plane, there's an exciting element of that.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.520]   But it also gives me the opportunity to show my family the world and to go places and do
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.680]   things that I thought I would only see in books.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.400]   So I agree with everything you said.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.520]   This is why I love this.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.240]   I thought before we jump into actually how to make sure you're getting the most value,
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.920]   we'd kind of rewind and talk about how do you not get the most value?
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.720]   So I'll share what my quick research led me to.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.800]   I'm curious if there's anything I'm missing.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.600]   But when I think about people saying, "How do you make sure you get the most out of your
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.000]   points?"
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I'm like, "Well, let's make sure you're not getting the least."
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.400]   Letting your points expire, obviously, maybe the worst.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.640]   You know, but...
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.960]   True.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.400]   Using them for gift cards, maybe the second worst.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.680]   Are there any other, like, just terrible ways to use your points to redeem them for the
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.400]   least value?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.640]   Shopping on Amazon is one that comes to mind because it frequently offers low value for
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.120]   your points.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   And that's where, you know, when you mentioned gift cards and things like that, they typically
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.320]   offer very low value for the points.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.920]   And when you asked before, you know, "Why care about points and miles rather than cash
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.480]   back?"
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.080]   Well, that comes into play here.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.880]   Because if you're going to redeem your points at less than one cent per point in value,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.440]   then maybe it would have been smarter to just focus on cash back and use your cash back
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.680]   to buy whatever stuff you want.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.000]   So if you're redeeming your points at very low value like that, it obviously just nerfs
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.680]   your potential outsize or your potential for outsize redemptions.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.160]   So yeah, I mean, gift cards tend to be among the worst.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.720]   Or shopping online, redeeming points that way.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.000]   Redeeming for a statement credit varies in quality from one type of mile or point to
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.840]   another in terms of how much you can get.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.560]   But typically, you're capped at about a penny a point at most, which is not a value that
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.760]   I would normally accept from my points and miles.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.520]   Now, I say that and I recognize there are some people that are the financial independence
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.720]   retire early crowd.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.360]   And for some of that crowd, I think that redeeming for statement credits might make some sense.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.400]   Or at least if you're focused on saving 10 or 15 cents per gallon on your gas or how
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.040]   much you're paying per square of toilet paper, then you may want to also focus on, OK, well,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.920]   how can I earn outsize value for my miles and points?
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.880]   Or how can I at least earn cash back that could well eclipse whatever it is I'm saving
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.680]   on other things?
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.080]   Because one or two new credit card bonuses a year, even if you're only redeeming at one
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   cent per point, will probably defeat or outperform, I should say, your efforts in a lot of other
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.880]   areas because the points can be worth so much.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.360]   Then you also have redeeming points and miles for travel through your credit card portal,
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.680]   and that typically looks a little bit better than a statement credit, but it doesn't necessarily
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.640]   perform better.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.880]   And what I mean by that is a lot of times card issuers or some card issuers at least
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.640]   will offer opportunities to get, like, let's say, 25 percent more for your points when
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.440]   you redeem points for travel through their travel portal.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.760]   And that looks and sounds good, but there's some opportunity cost involved there where
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.440]   you're not necessarily getting the 25 percent more that you think you are.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.200]   So, you know, for instance, if it's that 25 percent, you might think, OK, well, I'm getting
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.000]   1.25 cents per point in value out of my points.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.200]   But you're giving some things up because if you're booking through your credit card
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.120]   portal, you're losing the opportunity, for instance, to earn hotel points from the chain.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.200]   Normally, you know, if you book a Marriott, then you can earn Marriott points when you
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.760]   stay.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.520]   However, if you've booked through your credit card portal, you're not going to earn those
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.240]   Marriott points.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.520]   If you book directly through Marriott, you will get those points.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.800]   And most hotel chains offer a rebate somewhere in the range of like 8 to 20 percent, depending
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.440]   on your status and the card you use and things like that.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.440]   But but at any rate, you're giving up that, let's call it 10 percent to keep the math
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.560]   simple right there.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   And oftentimes you could be clicking through a shopping portal to book that hotel and
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.120]   potentially earning another five or 10 percent back.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.440]   And then if you have something like a AAA membership or some other type of coupon code
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.280]   that you might be able to use directly with the hotel chain, you might be able to reduce
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.320]   that price even further to the point where if you're redeeming points, you might actually
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.040]   be getting worse than one cent per point in value.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.800]   You might have been better off cashing out at one cent a point and booking that hotel
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.760]   directly using some of those various stacking methods.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.520]   So I don't necessarily love booking travel through the credit card portal, although there
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.640]   are times when it makes sense.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.360]   And I think it makes more sense for flights in general than for hotels.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.680]   And sometimes if you're booking a boutique hotel where you wouldn't have access to a
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.800]   better price otherwise, there are times when that can make sense.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.280]   But generally speaking, I find the opportunities to get outsized value to be in transferring
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.600]   your points to the various credit card transfer programs.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.720]   I agree.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.720]   I want to come back to the flight side of the travel portal, because two things are
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.200]   interesting.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:13.360]   One, I believe American just announced that you are not going to earn points or loyalty
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.480]   points or anything from flights that you don't book on their website, or I believe through
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.720]   some kind of corporate travel portals.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.200]   So it could be the case by the end of the year, even who knows that similar to booking
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.840]   hotels in a travel portal, you might not earn frequent flyer miles on airlines or status
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.040]   if you book on these portals.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.520]   I'm not sure if that's going to be the case.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.800]   I'm curious what you think.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.560]   But that's one aspect of flights that I think could potentially throw another wrinkle here.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.640]   Yeah, it definitely might.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.680]   I think this is one of those things that's still developing, and we're going to have
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.080]   to see how it all shakes out, because I think American's intention is to force any portals
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:01.360]   or any types of travel agencies to follow their rules and presumably to give them opportunities
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.240]   to earn more or price the flights higher when you're booking through someone else rather
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.440]   than directly through American.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   I don't know exactly what their goal is, but I think I get the sense that they're going
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.560]   to have a system to approve various travel agencies.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.240]   And so maybe the credit card companies will jump through whatever hoops they need to for
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.280]   people to earn miles.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.320]   It's hard to say.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.240]   I think it's kind of a short sighted system, to be honest with you, because commissions
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.280]   on airline tickets are so low that I can't imagine they can squeeze all that much more
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:29.680]   out of this.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.760]   It seemed kind of silly to me, but you're right.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.520]   I mean, if other airlines follow suit on that and it becomes the case that you can't earn
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.960]   frequent flyer miles and elite status when you're booking through your credit card portal,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.200]   that will more or less to me destroy the value of booking through a credit card portal in
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.880]   the vast majority of situations.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.120]   Yep.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.680]   The only two things I'll flag also just considerations for the portal, because if you have a Chase
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.720]   Sapphire Reserve card and you're like 1.5 cents, that can seem pretty compelling.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:03.360]   One is when things go wrong, you're often having to deal with the travel portal.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.120]   And so I've told a couple of stories about this in the past, but I had a flight and a
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.320]   friend was on the same flight.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   We wanted to cancel and take a different one.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.840]   I booked with the airline.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.400]   So I went to the desk and said, "Hey, the flight's delayed six hours.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.360]   Can you cancel it?"
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.120]   He had to call Amex Travel.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.200]   He was still on the phone with Amex Travel while we were taking off on the other flight.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.440]   And so that's one.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.600]   Same thing is sometimes true with hotel chains.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.200]   And then also the pricing.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.800]   I would say, like you mentioned, you might have access to other deals, but there might
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.840]   just be different pricing.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   So I would say always, if you're looking to book on the portal, thinking you're getting
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.520]   that 1.25 or 1.5 cents of extra added value, make sure you go somewhere else and look at
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.160]   the price.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.560]   And I can't remember which blog post, but I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.600]   Someone went out and said, "Looked at all these flights on all these different portals."
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.720]   It might have been your guises.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.360]   And in some cases, the flights in the portal are actually a little cheaper, especially
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.920]   for some international flights, often in business.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.560]   And in some cases, they were much more expensive.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.120]   So if you're going to pay a premium to book in the portal, it's also obviously not as
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.080]   good of a deal as you think.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.920]   And I mean, on the flip side, there are times when booking through the portal will be beneficial.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.520]   I mean, there are times, Amex has programs, for instance, with some airlines where you
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.480]   may actually get a better deal booking through their credit card portal.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.640]   But those times are more few and far between.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.240]   And like you said, you got to shop around.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.560]   You got to make sure that you know that you're getting a good deal because you aren't always.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.160]   And that affects the value you're getting.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.720]   So all of a sudden, that 1.5 cents might not be 1.5 cents, it might be 1.35 cents, or
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   maybe it's 1.15 cents, or you have to kind of shop around and figure that out.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.000]   And again, like I said, I typically find the opportunities to get far more value than that
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.520]   with the various airline and hotel programs to be so abundant that it's rare for me to
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.120]   find a situation where I would like to book travel through the credit card portal.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.560]   And like you said, I mean, those risks of irregular operations are an issue.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.720]   I try not to make too many of my decisions about travel booking based on irregular operations
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.560]   because they happen irregularly.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.720]   And generally speaking, I don't have those problems happen.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.320]   But when they do, you're right, it's a headache and nobody wants a headache.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.960]   Or at least you'd like to have less of a headache if you can.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.320]   And booking directly through the travel provider makes a lot of sense for that.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.800]   Okay, so I think we established a bunch of the ways that you can use your points for
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.480]   some value.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.000]   I guess the only one we forgot is if you have the Schwab platinum card,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.240]   you can transfer your points at 1.1 cents to your Schwab brokerage account.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.200]   So I guess there's something slightly better than one.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.880]   But I think the goal here is to talk about how you can do slightly more,
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.960]   if not a lot more than one.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.280]   And so the premise is transferring your points.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.840]   And we've talked about this a lot in the show.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.120]   But I think maybe just to kind of wet people's palate,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.800]   maybe we can give some examples.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.880]   I have a couple, I don't know if you do, of a booking where the value of your points just
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.760]   far exceeded the one, one and a half cents of value.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.840]   Well, sure, I'd love to hear about what you've done.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.560]   Go ahead, tell us.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.160]   Yeah, so the two examples that I have were kind of a practical one,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.760]   and then just kind of an extreme one.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.560]   So the practical one is, we live in San Francisco.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.960]   And I think one of the most amazing beach vacation destinations you can get to in one
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.000]   flight is Tahiti.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.320]   And it's notoriously expensive.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.280]   And so I was looking for my wife and I, we've now been to Bora Bora a couple times.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:34.000]   And the most recent time round-trip tickets in business class were $5,500 from San Francisco
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.360]   to Papiete, which sounds about right.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.280]   It doesn't seem like a good amount of money to pay for an eight-hour flight.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.680]   But that's what it was.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.960]   And so no surprise if you want to book it in the portal.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.520]   It was about 550,000 points at Amex.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.960]   At Chase, I could have gotten one and a half cents per point.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.280]   So it was about 365,000 points.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.000]   But I went to United's website and I was like, "Wow, I could book it for 145,000 points."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.600]   And so if you thought I could transfer those Chase points to United,
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.080]   I was getting twice as much value out of the point.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.560]   So it ended up being about 3.8 cents per point.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.360]   And that's where I think a lot of people would stop.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.560]   And that's where I'd encourage people to think, "Well, maybe you could take this one step
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:16.960]   further."
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.080]   And a few weeks ago, I had Greg on the show and we talked about award tools.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.920]   And one of the things we talked about was all these airlines have different partners.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.000]   And so I didn't just stop at United.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.160]   I said, "Well, if United has a good price,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.680]   maybe I can book that through a partner of United for even less."
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.720]   And the flight on Aeroplan through Air Canada's program was only 110,000 miles.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.600]   And so that's 5 cents per point.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.960]   So if you figure booking in the Amex portal would have been about 5 times as expensive.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.920]   And so I ended up getting 5 cents per point on that trip.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.520]   And I just felt great sitting in that seat knowing that I was getting a deal
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.520]   and everyone else was probably paying full fare.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.560]   That's a fantastic example because people who are newer to the partner redemptions,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.640]   the people that typically just look at the credit card portal,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.400]   I've often heard from people who've said, "Well, I've looked and Amex tells me it's
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.000]   going to be a million points for us to go here or go there."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.480]   And the thing of it is that, like you said, if you just look through the credit card portal,
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.640]   you're just going to see prices based on the cash price of the tickets.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.360]   Whereas most airline loyalty programs, most frequent flyer programs,
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.000]   have prices based on regions or distances that remain the same.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.960]   And they're totally divorced from the cash price in most cases where it doesn't matter
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.040]   if the flight is more or less, the award price is the award price if you find award availability.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.000]   And so it can make a huge, huge difference like that.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.360]   And so I think that's a fantastic example showing that, yeah, I mean, you can get
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.200]   a much, much, much better deal than what you see if you only scratch the surface.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.760]   You do have to dig a little bit deeper to find that because, of course,
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.160]   you had to know which partners to search and know where to search for those awards.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.600]   And then, of course, you have to know about transferring the points and booking it.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.680]   But all of those things are very learnable.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.360]   And with a little bit of effort, look at that.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.120]   I mean, you saved yourself.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.320]   Gosh, I mean, what is that?
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.360]   80% of the points, essentially, per passenger.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:15.920]   Exactly. Yeah.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.400]   And the goal of this episode is we're going to walk you through that entire process.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.280]   I'll give the other examples a bit more extreme because I didn't take this flight.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.640]   But if you wanted to book a flight from Houston to Abu Dhabi...
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.560]   And this might have changed now with some of these recent devaluations.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.720]   But if you wanted to fly first class on Etihad, that fare was about $18,000,
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.480]   which meant on Amex, you're going to pay about 1.8 million points.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.920]   And on Chase, if you have a Sapphire Reserve, by the way, if you just
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.600]   have to pay on your card, it might be the same 1.8 million points.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.280]   But it was a shy 1.2 million points, which is still a massive number of points.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.400]   Right.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.800]   But on Air Canada, at the time, when I looked,
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.120]   it was 130,000 miles for that exact same flight on Etihad.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.280]   So that was $0.14 per point.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.320]   So 14 times more value than you get in the portal.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.840]   And I was doing the math in my head.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.920]   I was like, "Wow, if I had an Amex Platinum card, and I'm buying a flight,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.880]   and I'm getting $0.05 or $0.05 per dollar,
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.080]   and I can make those points worth $0.14, right?
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.160]   I'm getting 70% cash back."
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.960]   And this is where you have to slow down a little in this process and say,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.240]   "Yes, that's true."
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.960]   If you were otherwise going to spend $18,000 on a first class ticket to Abu Dhabi,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.280]   which is certainly not true.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.400]   But like you said earlier, it feels good to get a deal.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.840]   It does. It does.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:43.680]   And while I think it gets murky in figuring out, "Okay, was that $0.14 per point?"
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.600]   Because you and I probably wouldn't have paid the $18,000 for that flight.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.360]   And so maybe it's not worth $18,000 to us,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.080]   but it's certainly worth more to me than flying Economy.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:18:00.320]   And so if I can fly in that first class seat and have the good champagne and the caviar
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.280]   and the experience that goes along with all of that,
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.440]   then suddenly the flight becomes part of the trip.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.360]   And like you said, you get the excitement of knowing that you've made a great redemption.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.000]   And again, the savings are incredible.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.480]   There are some people that save up millions of miles and points
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.960]   over years and years and years of using their credit card.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.080]   And I just hate to see somebody waste those 1.8 million points on something
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.280]   that you could have gotten for literally 10% of that cost
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.800]   by just knowing which partnerships to look for and which things.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.480]   So yeah, I think those are great examples.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.160]   And I think there are also smaller examples, if you think smaller,
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.680]   where you can still get well outsized value for your miles and points
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.920]   by learning how to maximize programs.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.520]   Those flights are the flashy, fun ones that I enjoy redeeming for.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.040]   But even in a more practical sense, if you look at last minute flights,
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.600]   you have some sort of a family emergency that comes up.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.880]   Often, flights at the last minute are exorbitantly expensive.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.360]   And those are great opportunities to use miles and points.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   I've done that for family members a number of times before,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.560]   where a family emergency came up and I was able to use a nominal number of miles to me
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.360]   to book a flight for a family member that was prohibitively expensive.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.520]   So I think there's a lot of opportunities there.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.080]   And those are definitely fantastic examples.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.240]   So you need to learn how to do that,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.360]   how to take advantage of those foreign airline partnerships, I think.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.800]   I think that's the key.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.360]   And it does take some time and some effort to learn.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.400]   But I think that the return on investment is well worth it.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.520]   And before we jump in, my one question is to someone listening who's like,
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.280]   OK, you know, last minute, you cherry picked two trips.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.600]   Like, is this really going to be that hard?
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.320]   Like, can I really get value out of this?
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.480]   Or is this all going to be me looking and looking and finding nothing?
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.000]   What do you say to that person?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.640]   You know, I think that like anything else,
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.920]   you get the value out for the effort that you put into it.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.320]   And so does it require some effort in terms of learning how to do this stuff?
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.760]   Yeah, you know, of course it does.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.840]   But is the juice worth the squeeze?
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.760]   Well, yeah, it absolutely is.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.440]   I mean, we travel like this all the time.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.360]   My family travels very frequently.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.480]   I do find awards.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.240]   It does require a slightly different perspective in terms of how you look at booking travel.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.200]   And we'll talk about flexibilities and things a little bit later on and how to find those things.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.680]   But I mean, you put in a little bit of effort
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.480]   and you could be flying first class for next to nothing.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.200]   And that is a pretty fantastic feeling.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.280]   You know, with a modicum of effort, you can save yourself tons and tons of money.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.040]   Or what I often tell people is I spend less money than most people I know on vacation,
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.320]   but I get far more vacations and far more comfortable experiences
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.400]   because you do have plenty of those opportunities to travel around the world
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.560]   and feel like you're not paying for it, to be honest.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.360]   I mean, you'll pay your award taxes and fees.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.920]   But when you're using Monopoly money to pay for the ticket
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.480]   and you're still getting the champagne and the caviar
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.680]   and the onboard chef or the shower or whatever it might be,
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   it certainly feels pretty incredible.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.760]   Are there any people listening who you'd say, you know what?
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.760]   If you're X, Y or Z, maybe this isn't for you.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.760]   And maybe you're not going to be able to get this value.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.280]   Yeah, I mean, if you're the type of person that doesn't enjoy gamifying things,
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.920]   you know, if you're somebody who wants to just get online and you have a trip in mind,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.400]   you want to go to Paris for the 4th of July.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.240]   And you just want to get that out of the way
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.560]   because you hate the planning part and the booking part.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.000]   And you just want to book it and, you know, use your car to be done with it.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And like that person exists.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I know it does plenty of people in my family and my friend circle live in that world.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.080]   And that's what they would prefer to do.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.440]   And so, you know, if you don't want to have to put some time into it,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.080]   and if you have very limited flexibility,
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.560]   then it may be a difficult world to get into.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.120]   Although I'll caveat that with saying that
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.280]   you might think that your flexibility is limited,
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.240]   but not realize how you can be more flexible.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.280]   And so I think that if you're willing to be open-minded
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.280]   in terms of how you look at trip planning,
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.760]   if you're willing to change some of your habits,
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.120]   then I think you're going to find that this world is actually pretty good
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.960]   for the vast majority of people.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.160]   I mean, we have lots of people.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.320]   I'm always surprised at the number of medical professionals,
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.000]   for instance, that are involved in this world.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.120]   Anytime I go to a conference,
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.920]   I meet lots of doctors who do this because they have that type of brain,
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.560]   that wired brain to maximize things and, you know, to exceed expectations.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.960]   And so they want to maximize miles and points.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.360]   But of course, you know, if you work in that type of field,
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.880]   your schedule is a lot more rigid.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.840]   So you have a lot less flexibility in terms of when you can travel
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.680]   and how long and which days.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.120]   And yet many of them are still able to find ways to maximize this world.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.360]   So I think that, you know, there are certain roadblocks where you could say,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.720]   oh, you know what, this isn't going to work for me because X, Y, Z.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.440]   But I think actually it's pretty good for most people,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.920]   unless you just really don't want to be bothered
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.440]   with the booking and planning process for your trips.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.520]   And, you know, in which case maybe travel just isn't for you.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.160]   And there are certainly some people that don't enjoy traveling.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.840]   And so if you don't enjoy traveling,
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.160]   then miles and points aren't going to excite you.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.720]   Then you may want to focus on those cashback redemptions
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.600]   that we talked about before.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.280]   Yeah. So maybe very briefly,
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.720]   let's mechanically talk about when we say transferring points,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.400]   what we mean, how it works,
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.480]   and then we'll jump into how to start planning that trip.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.680]   Sure. So each of the major credit card companies,
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.400]   issuers have their own native currencies.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.760]   So for example, American Express has membership rewards points,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.920]   or Capital One has their Capital One points,
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.440]   or Capital One miles, rather.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.560]   Citi has thank you points.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.560]   Chase has their ultimate rewards points.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.240]   And so those in-house sort of monopoly money currencies
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.160]   all have a variety of different uses.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.840]   So let's start with with Amex.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.920]   Amex has, I think off the top of my head,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.880]   I didn't actually look it up.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.520]   I think about 14 different airline transfer partners,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.320]   if I remember correctly, a couple of hotel transfer partners.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.680]   And so they have a bunch of different foreign airline programs
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.040]   and you can transfer your Amex membership rewards points
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.360]   to any of those various airline programs
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.320]   and then use those airline programs to book tickets.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.960]   So Amex, for instance, partners with Delta,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.040]   and surely most people are familiar with Delta.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.560]   You could transfer your Amex membership rewards points to Delta
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.480]   and then book a Delta award flight
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.640]   through your Delta account using your Delta miles.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.840]   Now, you probably won't want to do that
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.560]   because Delta will probably charge you a billion miles for the flight.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.720]   You're not necessarily going to make out better.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.880]   It's not going to be one of those examples
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.920]   that you gave before in terms of getting great value
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.120]   out of your miles and points.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.800]   But luckily, Amex has a lot of other good transfer partners
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.880]   where you can get fantastic value.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.680]   In fact, you could transfer to Virgin Atlantic, for instance,
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.160]   which is one of Amex's many transfer partners.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.240]   And in some cases, book Delta flights for far fewer miles
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.640]   than what Delta would charge for the same exact flight.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.240]   You know, you gave some great examples before.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.320]   And Business Class to Europe is one where
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.200]   sometimes I'll see Business Class tickets to Europe
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.840]   where Delta is charging two or almost 300,000 miles one way,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.720]   where those flights at times are available through Virgin Atlantic,
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.240]   the same Delta flight for 50,000 Virgin Atlantic miles.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.600]   And so you can transfer your membership rewards points
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.880]   to your Virgin Atlantic account.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.120]   You'll have to link up your Virgin Atlantic account.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.280]   So this requires step one, I suppose,
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.080]   signing up for a frequent flyer account with Virgin Atlantic,
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.000]   free, easy to do on their website,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   then connecting that to your Amex account
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.840]   within your Amex membership rewards account.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.000]   You can connect various loyalty programs.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.920]   So you can connect your Virgin Atlantic account
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.360]   with your account number.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.280]   And then it's just a matter of clicking a button
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.120]   and telling them how many points you want to transfer
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.640]   to your Virgin Atlantic account.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.200]   And most programs transfer instantly
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.720]   from the various credit card programs
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.400]   with just a couple of exceptions.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.520]   So as soon as you click through, the miles are there,
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.360]   and then you could use them to book your ticket
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.480]   through that airline program.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.080]   Yeah, I think one thing that I often hear from people
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.720]   who are a little bit new to the transferring world is,
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.560]   you know, they look at the transfer partners
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.720]   and they say, "Well, you know, I have an Amex.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.400]   I got a million Amex points,
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.680]   but I always fly United.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.040]   And so this isn't going to work."
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.480]   And I say, "Well, hold on.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.000]   I think you got to remember
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.080]   both the list of transfer partners
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.760]   and the way these airline alliances
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.960]   and partnerships work."
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.360]   And so you use that Delta example, which was great.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.800]   You know, you say, "I'm a Delta flyer.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.400]   I only want to fly Delta."
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.440]   Well, a couple of caveats.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.240]   One, most of the times when you're flying on points and miles,
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.320]   you're not going to earn points anyways.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.880]   So whether you book a Delta flight with your points
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.320]   or you book a United flight,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.840]   you're not going to earn your Delta miles
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.200]   and your Delta status anyways.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   So maybe you shouldn't worry about it.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.560]   But also, you know,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.240]   you mentioned Delta and Virgin Atlantic,
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.000]   but also Air France, KLM,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.360]   they're a partner of Delta.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.920]   And so even if you look at the transfer partners
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.840]   that your credit card company has,
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.000]   and I'll take Capital One as an example,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.840]   I don't think Capital One has any of the major US airlines,
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.400]   you know, Delta, United, American,
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.440]   but they do have a partner in every single alliance
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.400]   that includes Delta, American, and United.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.880]   And so it's possible from Capital One
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.720]   to transfer your points to, I believe, British Airways
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.480]   and probably Aeroplan,
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.960]   but I'm going off memory and I could be wrong here,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.040]   and Air France.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.800]   So you can get to alliances that might let you book
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.720]   the United, the Delta, or the American flight
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.560]   without actually being able to transfer them.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.960]   Yeah, and so we should probably back up a step
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.280]   and talk a little bit about airline alliances.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.840]   So, you know, you may or may not be aware
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.080]   that most major world airlines
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.840]   have partnerships with other airlines,
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.360]   and many of them belong to a major worldwide alliance
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.320]   of airlines.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.160]   And so I'll take United as an example.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.600]   They belong to the Star Alliance.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.760]   So there's, I think, 27 or 29
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.440]   different Star Alliance airlines.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.520]   And the reason that airlines created these partnerships
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.400]   in the first place is,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.560]   let's say you lived in Palm Springs
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.840]   and you really want to go to a Greek island.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.240]   Well, United doesn't fly from Palm Springs
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.360]   to an island in Greece.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.280]   They don't fly to Greece at all from Palm Springs.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.560]   In fact, I'm not even sure,
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.240]   they probably fly to Greece from somewhere,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.760]   but I don't even think they do probably
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.360]   from California at all.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.520]   So they can't get you there,
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.520]   but they still want to sell you a ticket
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.120]   if you're in Palm Springs.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.760]   And so they'll sell you a ticket to fly United
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.440]   from Palm Springs to Los Angeles
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.160]   and Lufthansa from Los Angeles to Frankfurt
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.480]   and AGN from Frankfurt to Athens
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.600]   and on to whatever island.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.920]   And so airlines created these partnerships
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.720]   to be able to do that,
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.320]   to connect their programs to do that.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.200]   And the nice side effect of that for us
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.600]   is that you can use miles from one airline
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.000]   to fly any of the airlines in their alliance.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.680]   So if you want to fly in United,
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.520]   you could use your United mileage plus miles,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.720]   but you could also use miles
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.640]   from any airline in the Star Alliance.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.320]   You could use Air Canada Aeroplan,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.600]   as you mentioned before.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.600]   You could use Avianca Life Miles.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   You could use Turkish Miles and Smiles.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.600]   And so there's tons of different ones.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.480]   And of course,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.640]   all the major airline transferable currencies
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.960]   transfer to a variety of these transfer partners.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.200]   And it's worth learning about that
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.160]   because of the examples
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.600]   like the one you gave before Chris,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.720]   where the price can vary dramatically.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.960]   I just flew to Hawaii recently
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.680]   and from Newark to Honolulu,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.000]   United would have charged 25,000 miles
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.080]   for that flight if I booked through United,
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.760]   but I didn't want to book through United
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.200]   because I didn't want to pay that many miles.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.960]   If I had booked through Singapore Airlines,
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.640]   I think it would have been about 20,000 miles
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.000]   these days they charge,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.520]   but I didn't want to pay that many either.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.560]   Aeroplan would have been 22,500 from New York,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.480]   but I booked it through Turkish Miles and Smiles,
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.280]   one of their partners,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.760]   which now charges 10,000 miles for that.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.840]   Less than half what United charges
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.760]   for the same exact United flight.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.240]   And the thing is,
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.320]   you have all of those options available to you.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.080]   And when you have a transferable currency,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.160]   like Amex membership rewards points
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.080]   or chase ultimate rewards points
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.520]   or Capital One miles,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.760]   you've got just this plethora of different options.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.840]   And so then it becomes a matter of figuring out,
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.560]   okay, well, you know,
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.880]   which airlines partner with which other airlines.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.000]   And so that's where I say
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.680]   there is some time investment involved
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.400]   in determining which are going to match up
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.240]   with your needs and what's available.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.600]   But oftentimes you'll find
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.040]   that the best deals are available
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.800]   with those foreign airline programs.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.520]   And it makes sense.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.200]   They want to collect revenue
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.880]   from American customers.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.440]   The major airlines earn a lot of money
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.200]   by selling miles to the banks.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.880]   And so all these foreign airline programs
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.000]   want to get in on that too.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.200]   And it makes sense then
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.600]   that they would frequently offer better pricing
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.880]   than the U.S. based airlines
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.680]   because they have less access to U.S. customers.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.280]   So it really pays to learn about those partnerships
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.560]   and figure out that, okay, yeah,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   I can use my Air France miles
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.920]   to fly on Virgin Atlantic,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.600]   or I can use my Virgin Atlantic miles
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.920]   to fly on Delta or my Avianca Life miles
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.280]   to fly on United.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.200]   And initially that seems overwhelming,
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.560]   I think, for somebody who's new to this.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.280]   They're like, whoa,
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.040]   you just named like six different airlines
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.320]   and maybe you don't even know
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.760]   all of those airlines,
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.680]   haven't heard of some of them perhaps.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.440]   And so it seems a little overwhelming
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.160]   in the beginning,
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.440]   but that's where, you know,
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.200]   there's a variety of different award search tools
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.040]   that can help you find those things.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.880]   So, you know, these days,
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.400]   I think it's a little bit easier actually
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.920]   for a beginner to get into it
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.600]   because there's so many different tools on the market
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.760]   to help you figure out how those things work.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.040]   - Yeah.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.200]   And Greg, your co-host came on the show a few weeks ago
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.040]   and we did an entire episode on that
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.760]   and intentionally recorded that episode first
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.000]   so that if anyone's listening to this and says,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.920]   oh, how do I use these tools?
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.960]   We didn't want to say,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.280]   well, now that we've gotten you excited to book an award,
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.360]   wait three weeks to find out how to use the tools.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.880]   So you can go back and listen to that.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.400]   Maybe you already listened to it.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.760]   Maybe you want to watch it on YouTube
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.120]   where I did some screen sharing
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.400]   so you can see how the tools work.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.040]   And so that episode exists.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   So we're not going to cover today
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.720]   how to actually search for the flights using the tools.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.480]   And we're not going to cover, you know,
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.080]   how to make sure that if you find it,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.720]   like you did from New York to Honolulu,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.480]   how do you figure out who's the best price?
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.000]   Because that's what the tools are going to do.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.840]   Greg and I talked a lot about that.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.120]   But what we are going to talk about
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.120]   is kind of the way you think about this.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.720]   And I think the only other thing
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.480]   to kind of make sure you understand
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.080]   before we go forward
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.760]   is just because an airline has a seat
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.000]   doesn't necessarily mean you can book it
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.400]   with miles at a reasonable price.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.320]   And so there used to be a distinction
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.000]   of like Saver and Standard
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.880]   and Saver was kind of released to partners.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   But how do you think about that world today?
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.840]   Well, things have changed quite a bit,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.160]   at least on the United States front
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.200]   in terms of how the U.S.-based airlines operate,
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.760]   because the major U.S. airlines,
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.160]   and I'm talking about American, Delta, United here,
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.200]   have kind of changed their model from that,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.720]   where nowadays they price their flights dynamically.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.040]   And so you don't know in advance
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.520]   how much to expect to have to pay exactly.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.200]   And obviously, this is a game for the airlines
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.720]   to figure out, OK, well,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.840]   how many seats do we think
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.200]   we're going to sell on this flight?
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.880]   And so obviously, if they think
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.640]   they're not going to sell out the entire flight,
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.320]   then they're going to make some more seats available
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.920]   at lower redemption rates.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.040]   And if it's a peak time, a peak destination,
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.800]   then they're going to make fewer seats
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.480]   or maybe no seats available
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.240]   at the cheapest redemption levels.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.200]   So there is some challenge, I think,
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.360]   in determining what's going to work
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.880]   in terms of your schedule
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.280]   and where that pricing is going to be,
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.800]   because it does vary and not all seats are available.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.040]   Now, a number of programs like American
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.120]   and Delta and United will make most seats
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.160]   available with miles,
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.280]   but they'll charge you a lot for those last seats.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.880]   And so it pays to have a little bit of flexibility.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.920]   And, you know, flexibility is one of those things
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.240]   that so I often tell people
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.680]   that if you want to travel more,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.840]   you need one of three things in abundance.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.240]   And the more you have of that one thing,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.760]   the easier it is to travel more.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.520]   And if you have more of more
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.960]   than one of these three things,
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.320]   then it becomes easier yet.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.240]   And so the first thing, obvious money, right?
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.520]   If you've got millions and millions of dollars,
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.160]   easy to travel.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.440]   You just pay for the flights you want
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.960]   whenever you want to travel, right?
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.000]   So that's number one.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.680]   Number two is millions
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.720]   and millions of miles and points.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.240]   If you've got an infinite number of miles and points,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.160]   well, you can pay whatever number of miles and points
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.240]   it is for that last seat on the plane
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.600]   or through your credit card portal
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.720]   and not have to worry about it.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.800]   Those two things are difficult
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.560]   for most people to get more of.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.920]   The third thing that influences your ability
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.440]   to travel more is flexibility.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.040]   And so, for instance,
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.560]   if you're retired or you travel,
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.640]   we work remotely rather,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.800]   and you can travel and work while you travel,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.880]   then you've got infinite possibilities, right?
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.160]   You can travel whenever you want.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.840]   And so that is nice if you've got it,
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.080]   but most people don't have that much flexibility.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.200]   And so you might think, well,
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.320]   I don't have any flexibility.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.400]   I got to travel when the kids are out of school,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.160]   or I have to travel when I bid my vacation
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.400]   a year in advance, so I'm not flexible.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.160]   But I think it just requires looking
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.920]   at your travel booking process
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.000]   a little bit differently than you have in the past.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.600]   Most people decide, okay, well, this year,
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.440]   I'm going to go to Disney World
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.280]   or I'm going to go skiing in Colorado,
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.880]   or I'm going to go to Paris.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.080]   And they say, okay, well,
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.440]   4th of July, I'm off that week.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.040]   I'm going to go to Paris that week.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.440]   And they look at prices and book a ticket
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.880]   and hotels and everything else.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.640]   And that's the normal way to book travel.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.960]   But I often tell people that
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.120]   if you can have destination flexibility,
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.160]   that can actually have a huge impact
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.840]   on your ability to use miles
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.680]   and points to your advantage.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.600]   And destination flexibility requires
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   a seismic shift in the way that you plan travel,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.240]   but it also has an incredibly outsized effect.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.440]   So for instance,
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.200]   I look at travel a lot differently.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.240]   I say, well, you know,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.360]   there's a lot of places in Europe
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.080]   I'd like to visit.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:00.800]   I love Paris.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.480]   I'd be happy to go back to Paris.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.320]   But there's also a couple of Greek islands
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.440]   that I haven't seen before
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.320]   that I would like to get to.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.240]   And I always like to get to Italy.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.480]   And so I'd be open to going to Europe
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.680]   just about any time.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.120]   I also love the beach.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.680]   So a tropical destination is always nice for me.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.040]   And I don't really like to ski,
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.640]   but let's pretend that I like to ski.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.680]   And so like, I want to ski
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.720]   and people like to ski,
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.320]   like to ski in new areas,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.840]   new mountains, new places, right?
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.360]   So rather than saying,
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.480]   I'm going to go to Paris,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.760]   I'm going to go to Aruba,
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.200]   I'm going to go skiing in Colorado.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.800]   I say, those are all things
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.160]   that I would like to do.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.400]   And so if I see a great opportunity
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.680]   for any of those things,
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.360]   I'm going to jump on that opportunity.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.120]   And so I'll just keep searching
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.560]   and looking at various options
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.080]   and I'll say, oh, well, here, look,
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.600]   I found a great price to Dublin
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.200]   and I can get to Paris from Dublin
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.280]   for 20 or $30 on a cheap,
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.800]   you know, European airline carrier.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.400]   But I got a great flatbed seat
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.000]   from San Francisco to Dublin.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.360]   And that isn't something
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.560]   that's easy to find.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.400]   So if I'm open and flexible
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.360]   with my destination,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.080]   then I'll pick that
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.200]   and I'll let the destination
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.840]   kind of pick me.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.360]   And so I'll be open
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.280]   to a variety of different places
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.200]   and see, OK, well, what deal pops up?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.320]   Because the deal always
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.760]   pops up eventually.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.040]   And, you know, maybe this year
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.640]   I'll go to Europe
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.320]   or maybe I'll see a great deal
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.320]   on a beach vacation to Aruba
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.240]   or maybe I'll see, oh, wow,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.920]   there's four seats available
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.600]   on a flight to Santiago, Chile,
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.800]   and they have mountains there.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.480]   And our summertime is their winter.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.000]   So I can go skiing in July.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.760]   And so I'll be open
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.600]   to destinations like that.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.360]   And then that opens up a lot more
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.480]   because then you have
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.520]   a lot more opportunities
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.640]   to find safer seats
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.000]   instead of saying, OK,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.120]   I'm just going to go here
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.000]   during this week.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.200]   If you're like, I'm going to travel
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.880]   during this time period,
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.880]   but I'm kind of open to where I go,
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.240]   then it opens your possibilities
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.440]   to get massively outsized
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.400]   value out of your points.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.120]   And, you know, Paris
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.920]   is always going to be there.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.280]   So maybe I'll get there this year.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.160]   Maybe it'll be next year.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.200]   Maybe it'll be the year after.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.000]   I'm sure eventually
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.440]   I'll run into a situation
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.320]   where that'll work out.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.520]   But there's a whole world
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.360]   full of other destinations also.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.800]   And I'm going to let the destination
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.680]   that becomes available,
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.720]   that fits my schedule,
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.240]   that provides an awesome deal,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.840]   dictate where it is that I go this year.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.560]   Or I guess one thing
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.840]   that I'm realizing now is.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   We have a little bit more
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.440]   flexibility in our time, right?
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.200]   We're both self-employed this year.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.880]   Who knows how long that'll last?
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.960]   And so we can really crank up
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.720]   the flexibility on the time.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   And I think if you can do that,
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.000]   maybe you don't even have to be
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.360]   as flexible on the destination.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.720]   Like there are a couple
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.080]   vectors of flexibility.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   And so I think the third one is flexible
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.920]   about how far before you leave,
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.960]   you know where you're going.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.200]   And I've found sometimes
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.240]   if you have your heart set
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.840]   to go on Paris and to Paris
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.760]   in the summer with three people,
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.680]   you know, if you're flexible enough
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.360]   that you won't know when you're going
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.920]   until a couple days before,
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.280]   you could probably really increase
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.880]   your likelihood you could do that.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.320]   I'm not going to recommend that path.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.640]   You know, we'll get to like booking
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.080]   something and changing it later.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.760]   But flexibility not
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.200]   just comes in destination.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.560]   It could come in time of year.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.880]   It could come in how far out you plan.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.680]   And so all those things kind of play
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.880]   play to the whole situation.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.360]   Yeah, I mean, I think that's a great point
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.240]   because the way you plan travel
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.200]   also absolutely has a lot of effect on
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.640]   what's going to be available to you.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.920]   You know, when are you going to
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.720]   how far in advance
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.320]   do you need to plan this out?
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   Because I think that your example there
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.520]   was a great one in the sense
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.360]   that you're right so that, you know,
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.480]   you talk about the best times
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.760]   to book award travel, right?
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.320]   And for I think for most people,
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   probably one of the best times,
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.360]   if not the best time,
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.880]   is really far in advance.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.560]   So airlines tend to release
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.160]   their schedule about a year in advance.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:34.880]   And when they first
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.320]   release their schedule,
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.920]   there's generally speaking,
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.040]   and this is a broad statement,
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.320]   so it's not always going to be the case.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.200]   But generally speaking,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:41.920]   more of a chance
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.040]   that you're going to find
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.400]   those best price,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.240]   saver awards availability
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.160]   close to when they release the schedule.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.200]   And that varies, like I said,
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.160]   from airline to airline.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.520]   There are some airlines that guarantee
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.400]   that they're going to release
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.200]   X number of seats
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.480]   when they open the schedule.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.520]   And then other airlines
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.200]   that are less predictable like that.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.720]   So it does vary some,
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.840]   but that tends to be
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.440]   one of the easier times
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.280]   to find seats to go somewhere.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   So you do have to then consider, OK,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.160]   well, I have to plan
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.520]   pretty far in advance for that.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.960]   A second best,
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.720]   not necessarily the second best,
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.680]   but another best time to book
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.480]   is like you said,
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.760]   sort of at the last minute.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.960]   If I want to go to Europe,
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   booking a flight tomorrow
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.040]   is probably going to be easier
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.920]   than booking a flight
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.960]   three or four months from now,
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.000]   believe it or not,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.640]   because tomorrow the airlines know,
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.520]   well, we're only going to sell
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.120]   so many seats on that flight
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.320]   that's taking off tomorrow
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.680]   between now and then.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.120]   And so they're more likely
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.160]   in the weeks and days
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.960]   before departure
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.400]   to open up some seats.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.080]   So being flexible in that way
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.160]   certainly can make a huge influence
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.400]   and may give you the best options
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.040]   to book a trip.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.080]   But it's not the most practical
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.800]   for most people.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.840]   Most people can't just wait
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.040]   until a couple of days before
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.160]   to find out where
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.200]   and when they're going.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.800]   So most of us are going to have
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.480]   to either plan far in advance
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.480]   or search pretty often.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.120]   And, you know,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.560]   that's another thing that I do.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.840]   I'm frequently looking
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.560]   for award flights.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.080]   If I'm in line at the grocery store,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.280]   I'm usually scrolling
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.240]   through award flights
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.280]   and availability
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.480]   and looking for trips
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.120]   that we can take
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.480]   or ways we can improve trips
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.280]   that we have booked.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.840]   When Greg and I were talking,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.760]   we broke it into flight search tools
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.120]   and flight discovery tools.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.480]   And I think the advent
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.160]   of these flight discovery tools
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.120]   is going to be really great
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.040]   for people who could say,
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.160]   you know, every few days,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:20.880]   I'm just going to check
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.480]   where four people can go to
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.720]   that's warm in July.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.920]   And, you know,
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.440]   this stuff changes so much
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.040]   that, you know,
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.320]   saying you check today
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.680]   and you didn't find anything
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.040]   does not mean that vacation
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.400]   in three months is off the table.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.280]   That's a really important point.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.000]   And one that really is worth
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.880]   repeating, I think,
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   because award availability
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.840]   changes all the time.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.640]   And that can be one
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.840]   of the most frustrating things.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.200]   When you asked earlier about
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.560]   who is this not good for?
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.360]   And I said, well, it's
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.920]   I think I mentioned that it's
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.200]   perhaps not good for somebody
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.320]   who doesn't have patience,
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.280]   because you need
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.200]   some amount of patience for this,
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.080]   because exactly what you said is so true.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.440]   I could search for an award
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.120]   flight today and tomorrow
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:03.840]   and the day after
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.440]   and see absolutely nothing.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.320]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.200]   a few hours later,
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.160]   search again and see
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.360]   that the floodgates have opened
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.120]   and there's tons of available seats.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.320]   It can change at any moment.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.520]   We don't know in advance
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.320]   when that's going to
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.520]   change all the time.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.120]   And so you do have to be
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.960]   somewhat persistent and willing
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.800]   to wait it out and say, OK, well,
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.840]   I'm going to keep searching
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.880]   and look for something.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.800]   And then also the other piece of it.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.080]   And, you know, you mentioned
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.840]   talking about flexibility
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.760]   is that many award flights
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.520]   are changeable or cancelable.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.720]   And depending on who you book through,
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.840]   the cost of that or lack of cost
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.760]   is going to vary from one to another.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.680]   But being open to booking
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.040]   something that's not perfect,
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.160]   but is good,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.600]   is also going to be another
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.640]   another major piece
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.600]   of your trip planning
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.400]   that's going to require,
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.520]   again, a shift from the way
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.480]   that most people
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.600]   look at planning travel,
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.320]   because most people
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.520]   just book a flight and that's it.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.240]   They've paid for it.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.600]   They can't get their money back.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.040]   And so they're locked into it.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:55.680]   Whereas when you're
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.040]   booking award travel,
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:57.760]   if I see something
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.280]   that looks pretty good,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.560]   I'll jump on it and book it,
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.840]   knowing that later on
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.120]   I can continue to search.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.160]   And if I find something better,
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.920]   I can cancel the first option
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.000]   and switch to the better option.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.680]   And so, yeah, I think that
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.120]   that is something that you
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.160]   it helps to have
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.200]   that kind of flexibility
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.600]   and to look at booking travel
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.720]   in that flexible way.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.480]   We've talked before on our show
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.320]   about finding impossible awards.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.680]   And that's one of the tips
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.800]   and one of the key things
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.040]   that you really do need to be willing
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.160]   to continue searching
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:26.880]   and to book something
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.160]   that's maybe not perfect
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.360]   and work on improving it.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.120]   Yeah, I mean, you said
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.000]   you talked about it.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.120]   It's actually an episode.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.080]   So I will link to the
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.440]   Finding Impossible Awards
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.560]   episode in the show notes.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.720]   And the only thing I'll remind people
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.240]   that we didn't actually say
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.000]   is that when you transfer your points
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.680]   from any of these bank programs
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.880]   to an airline,
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.640]   you cannot transfer them back.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.960]   Maybe in some rare case
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.840]   that there was a glitch,
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.040]   but I would say 99.999% of the time
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.240]   you're not going to.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.400]   So look, if you transfer them
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   to a program that is kind of
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.000]   pretty generally available
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.160]   for lots of things like Air France,
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.600]   KLM, where I feel like
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.960]   you'll probably be able to use them
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.960]   if something better comes up, great.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.040]   But the risk being,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.320]   I talked a few weeks ago
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.760]   about some devaluations
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.560]   and, you know,
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.760]   if you had transferred your points
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.600]   to Turkish Miles and Smiles,
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.880]   found a better deal
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.480]   and left all your Turkish Miles
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.360]   there for the future,
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.520]   that Turkish program,
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   yes, those Hawaii routes are still there.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.640]   So maybe you'll just have
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.480]   a lot of Hawaii trips in your future.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   But a lot of their international
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.080]   business class flights
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.600]   got much more expensive.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.760]   So yes, you can cancel
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.360]   flights last minute and rebook,
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.360]   especially if you do it
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.720]   within the program.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.240]   You know, you'll be you'll be fine
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.760]   because you're using those points again.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.880]   But don't forget that
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.480]   if you transfer a bunch of points
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.240]   to an airline, cancel,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.520]   get your points back,
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.120]   book on another program,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:49.840]   you might not be able
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.800]   to use those points.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.960]   Right, right, right.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.160]   And I think that one of
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.760]   the biggest misconceptions
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.360]   among people that aren't
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.960]   wildly familiar with this world
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.880]   is that I think oftentimes
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.160]   people say, well, how do I transfer
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.080]   my United Miles to Air Canada
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.760]   or my Air Canada Miles to United?
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.800]   And you don't do that
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.320]   with the partnerships.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.680]   You'll use your United Miles
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.160]   to book perhaps an Air Canada flight
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.440]   or use your Air Canada Miles
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.880]   to book a United flight.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.200]   But you can't actually move the miles
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.960]   from one airline program to another.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.720]   Once they're in that one airline program,
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:21.520]   like I said, they're stuck.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.800]   That's it. They're there.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.400]   And, you know, whether that's good
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.000]   or bad news for you is going to vary.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.880]   But you can't.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.680]   It's a one way street.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.880]   You can't move them back.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.320]   So generally speaking,
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.400]   I prefer to work with programs where,
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.480]   A, I know that I use them frequently.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.120]   B, they don't have a high risk
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.560]   of devaluing soon.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.520]   Although I say that
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.960]   and we never really know
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.480]   when a devaluation is coming.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.640]   So you don't know when that value
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.320]   proposition is going to change.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.400]   So there is some level of gamble in that.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.800]   But again, if you find an award,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.560]   that's good, that you're happy with,
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.920]   even if it's not the perfect one,
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.560]   then, you know, well,
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.760]   you've got a good award booked.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.160]   And so that hopefully will hold up
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.600]   or, you know, in many cases,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.960]   it'll work out OK for you.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.360]   So but very good point
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.120]   that it is a one way street.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.080]   And so you can't
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.360]   get that flexibility back.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.600]   And the value of transferable points
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.040]   is really in the flexibility
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.080]   to transfer to various
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:12.880]   different programs.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.240]   We've talked about the various
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.680]   transferable programs in our show
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.880]   lots of times before, too.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.240]   And which which is the best
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.600]   transferable points program
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.960]   was episode 243.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.720]   And that's not a topic
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.760]   that's easy to
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.440]   come up with a universal answer.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.680]   But we've talked about the the power
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.440]   of transferable currency as many times
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.800]   and the power is the flexibility.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.600]   Once you transfer to
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.040]   an individual airline program,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.320]   you do give that up
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.520]   and you give it up in exchange
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.880]   for hopefully a great award.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.800]   But you do give up the flexibility.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.880]   Yeah, and the only other thing
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.000]   I just thought of is we talked
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.440]   about the best times to book, right?
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.240]   You could book right
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.600]   when the award calendar comes out.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.640]   You can book last minute.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.960]   If you're flexible, you can book any time
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.640]   because things are always changing.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.880]   The one time I will remind
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.400]   people to consider is
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.880]   from time to time, various card programs
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.400]   offer these transfer bonuses.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.640]   And so, you know, for for example,
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.760]   I think right now there's one to Avianca.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.040]   There's one to Air France,
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.240]   depending on which credit card
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.200]   program you have.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.200]   By the time we record and publish this,
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.000]   it might not be there.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   But in general, if you're keeping
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.040]   an eye on those things,
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.160]   and I know you guys post
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.200]   about them on your website,
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.560]   I send them out of my newsletter.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.920]   That's a great time
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.120]   to start looking, right?
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.240]   You know, it doesn't mean
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.440]   you're going to find the trip
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.560]   and I wouldn't transfer
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.000]   unless you have something planned.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.280]   But if all of a sudden you see,
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.360]   wow, I have a lot of chase points
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.640]   and I can get 30% more
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.320]   of them going to Air France.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.840]   Might as well see if there's a vacation.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.520]   We want to book for the family
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.240]   on Air France.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.360]   And if you find it,
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.400]   what better time than
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.080]   when your miles go 30% further?
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.560]   Transfer bonuses are huge
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.240]   and they offer opportunities
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.760]   to get even more outsized value.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.400]   I mean, you know,
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.760]   you gave great examples before
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.080]   where it's not uncommon in this world
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.400]   to get three or four or five
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.480]   or maybe 10 cents per point in value,
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.160]   depending on on how you determine
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.520]   that versus the cash prices.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.160]   And yeah, if you can get 25 or 30
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.680]   or 40% more or whatever
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.400]   the case may be
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.360]   with the transfer bonus,
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.640]   then you absolutely want
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.920]   to take advantage of that.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.200]   If like you said,
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.040]   if you found the trip
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.840]   that you want to book,
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.040]   but it's a great time to look.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.720]   It does always make me look.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.160]   I mean, that's certainly part
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.520]   of the the impetus
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.400]   behind offering those
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.280]   is to get us to look.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.560]   And sure enough, I do,
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.920]   because I want to see
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.040]   if I can make my points
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.800]   and miles go a little bit further.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.680]   It's all part of that.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.960]   Getting a great deal.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.640]   And oftentimes some of those programs,
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.760]   like you mentioned, Air France,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.960]   Avianca Life Miles,
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.400]   they frequently offer
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.440]   some of the best deals
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.920]   in award travel at their full prices.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.480]   So if you're able
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.680]   to get a transfer bonus
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.360]   and you found a trip
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.160]   that you want to book,
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:38.640]   then you can get
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.680]   a really incredible deal.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.220]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.120]   Let's talk a little bit
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.800]   about the practical ways
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.360]   that you're doing
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.640]   some of these searching
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.480]   things like positioning flights
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.520]   or just finding
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.040]   one particular leg first.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.960]   How do you actually structure a trip?
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.000]   You know, you mentioned
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.960]   I'm always looking.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.200]   What exactly are you looking for?
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.440]   Yeah, that's a great question,
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.600]   because this is also a big change
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.240]   from the way people
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.760]   that don't use points and miles
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.920]   look at booking travel.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.000]   And so for me, I tend to like
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.200]   to use my miles and points
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.400]   to fly in business class
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.920]   because it's comfortable
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.600]   on international business class routes,
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.480]   long haul international
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.360]   business class routes.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.000]   We're talking about
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.440]   usually a flatbed seat
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.120]   so I can get a full night's sleep,
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.960]   a good meal and arrive
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.920]   rested and comfortable
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.120]   and ready to hit the ground running.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.080]   And then that's become
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.120]   super valuable to me.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.000]   That's something that I never
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:26.880]   would have paid for
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.800]   before I started
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.080]   using miles and points.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.600]   But once I started using them,
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.160]   it's something that
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.520]   I've gotten so used to
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.880]   that I have a hard time
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.680]   letting that go,
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.040]   because it's great to be able
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.880]   to not waste that first day
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.560]   recovering from jet lag.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.320]   And so because that's
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.280]   what matters to me,
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.240]   getting that good night's
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.440]   sleep and a good meal
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.640]   and having that comfortable
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.920]   travel experience.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.680]   I start with finding
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.200]   that long haul flight.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.280]   So I'm located in upstate
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.480]   New York in a small town
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.160]   because I'm drivable
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.120]   to New York City.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.240]   I'll start with looking
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.600]   at flights from New York City
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.640]   and I'll say, OK, well,
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.240]   let me look at flights
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.000]   from New York City to London
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.840]   or to Paris or wherever it is
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.200]   that I'm looking to find.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.400]   And let me see if I can find
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.560]   that long haul flight first.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.960]   And if I found that, well, great.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.240]   Then if I need a connector
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.680]   from my home airport
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.960]   to get to New York City,
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.080]   then I can look at
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.120]   booking that either
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.640]   separately or in conjunction.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.920]   But I definitely start
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.360]   with the long haul flights first.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.480]   And another sort of similar,
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.280]   but different example
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.040]   is if I'm looking to go to Asia,
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.360]   I will look at flights from Chicago
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.120]   and flights from San Francisco
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.200]   because there are far more airlines
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.520]   that serve Asia from those places
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.640]   than well, or at least
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.400]   there are airlines that serve
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.440]   Asia from those places.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.480]   And there are not airlines
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.200]   that serve Asia
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.560]   from my home airport.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.680]   So I'll look for the long
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.880]   haul flights first.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.240]   And so if I find a good
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.520]   long haul flight,
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.400]   then I'll say, OK,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.880]   well, which airline alliance is that?
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.520]   And so if it's a Star Alliance airline,
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.560]   let's say I want to go to Tokyo
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.440]   and I find a great flight
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.360]   from Chicago to Tokyo.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.400]   I don't live in Chicago.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.600]   I live in upstate New York,
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.440]   but I'm one flight away from Chicago.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.960]   I can fly United
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.360]   from Albany to Chicago.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.200]   And because United is also
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.240]   on the Star Alliance,
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.520]   then I might be able to get
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.600]   that entire trip booked together.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.800]   But what I don't want to do
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   is start by searching from Albany,
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.960]   because then if that short,
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.920]   you know, two hour flight
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.280]   from Albany to Chicago
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   is not available as an award,
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.160]   I'm not going to see
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.200]   that long haul flight
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.240]   that I really care about
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.600]   from Chicago to Tokyo,
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.840]   simply because that one
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.080]   small leg is not available.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.600]   And flights from Albany to Chicago
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.200]   are not terribly expensive.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.480]   So I'll sometimes look at
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.840]   piecing things together.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.520]   And so I'll find that long haul
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.760]   flight from Chicago to Tokyo,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.760]   and maybe I'll book that
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.640]   and then book a separate
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.680]   positioning flight to get
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.880]   from Albany to Chicago.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.400]   And that opens up my options,
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.760]   because now I can use miles
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.040]   and fly whichever carrier
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.720]   it is that offers the best deal
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.240]   to get from Albany to Chicago.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.280]   I could fly United
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.680]   or American Airlines or Southwest
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.760]   or all the various options
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.200]   I have available to me
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.640]   to book a positioning flight.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.680]   And so we talk about
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.040]   positioning flights a lot
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   because I will look at award
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.640]   flights from a variety of airports.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.080]   Like I said, I live in upstate New York.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.120]   I can drive to the New York
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.160]   City airports.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.720]   I can get to Boston by taking a train.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.920]   I can take a one hour flight
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.440]   to get to Washington, D.C.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.560]   So I'll look at award
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.760]   availability from all of
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   those cities very often.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.480]   And like I said, if I'm
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.280]   looking to get to Asia,
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.400]   I'll also look at award
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.160]   availability from the West Coast,
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.280]   because the most important
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.640]   piece to me is getting
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.760]   that long haul flight.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.000]   So I will usually look
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.480]   for those individually first.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.000]   Then I'll look and see, OK,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.600]   well, is there one single
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.880]   award from my home airport
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.920]   on that date?
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.440]   Because I need to find the dates
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.200]   that have the best price awards
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.120]   for the long haul flights first.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.400]   And then we'll see if we can
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.080]   add in that positioning flight
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.880]   or if I have to book
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.800]   the positioning flight separately.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.160]   And so if I have to book
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.440]   the positioning flight separately,
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.240]   then I'll look at, OK,
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.080]   what are my options for booking that?
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.440]   And many of the U.S.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.400]   based programs offer
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.000]   free cancellations these days.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.960]   So sometimes I'll book
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.000]   two positioning flights.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.040]   So if I have that Chicago
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.080]   to Tokyo flight, I want to
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.520]   make sure I get there for that.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.640]   So I might book a flight
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.000]   from Albany to Chicago
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.280]   on both United
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.400]   and American Airlines.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.360]   So that way, if my United
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.560]   flight gets canceled,
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:13.440]   I'll have an American
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.280]   Airlines flight as a backup
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.480]   and I could always cancel
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.320]   one of them later if I've got miles
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.600]   in all the various programs.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.480]   But I definitely start
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.520]   with the long hauls first,
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.880]   because those tend to be
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.480]   the hardest flights to find.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.440]   And especially when you're
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.800]   looking at partner awards,
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.040]   those flights are the ones
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.800]   that you'll need to have
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.520]   availability on to start with.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.240]   If you want to be able
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   to piece together anything better.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.600]   Now, there are some exceptions.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.640]   There are some programs
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.840]   that will only price awards
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.880]   when you have a connection
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.040]   at the cheapest levels.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.160]   And that's a little weird.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:46.960]   American Airlines
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.000]   frequently does that,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.040]   where if you start
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.960]   from New York to Paris,
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.160]   you may see an exorbitant
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.440]   number of American Airlines
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.720]   miles for that flight.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.080]   But if you start
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.400]   in Florence, South Carolina,
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.000]   you may find a great deal
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.760]   on that flight that includes
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.360]   the New York to Paris lag.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.720]   It's really weird like that.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.440]   It's in fact,
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.560]   that's a real life example.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.840]   I booked that a few days ago
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.120]   for a family member,
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.800]   and it was way cheaper
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.480]   to book it starting in Florence
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.520]   than it was to book
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.480]   it starting in New York.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.600]   And originally I started
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.720]   looking from New York and thought,
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.360]   well, I can get them
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.800]   from Florence to New York
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.160]   separately if I have to.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.280]   But I mean, kind of need
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.720]   to be able to be flexible
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   and search both of those things.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.840]   But again, I focus
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.720]   on the longest flights
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.200]   because those are
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.400]   the most important to me.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.440]   And then I kind of go
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.480]   backwards from there
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.520]   and finding, OK,
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.440]   how will I get to that gateway
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.480]   from where I am?
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.600]   Can it be the same award
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.320]   or does it need to be
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:36.960]   a separate one?
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.800]   And, you know,
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.240]   I know if you were to book
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.840]   a American flight
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.960]   to get to Chicago
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.920]   and you had a United flight
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.120]   to Tokyo and that American
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.240]   flight's four hours late
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.000]   and you miss your flight to Tokyo,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.280]   United doesn't care
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.240]   that your American
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.280]   flight was was late.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.880]   Now, will they maybe try
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.640]   to accommodate you if they can?
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.480]   Yes, but not nearly
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.360]   as much as they would
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.000]   if you had booked
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.200]   it all through on United.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.440]   Any advice to people
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.960]   when they're booking those flights
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.560]   to make sure that they don't end up
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:05.680]   in a situation like that?
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   Yeah, that is a good point.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.880]   And if you're able to book
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.400]   as a single award, that's great.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.240]   So if you were able to find
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.240]   a United flight from Albany
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.840]   to Chicago that then lines up
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.120]   with a Star Alliance flight
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.680]   on ANA from Chicago to Japan,
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.920]   then that's ideal,
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.520]   because then if it's all
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.960]   booked as one ticket,
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.160]   then if your United flight
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.120]   is four hours late,
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.040]   United is going to accommodate
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.080]   you in one way or another.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.600]   They'll get you on another flight
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.640]   to Tokyo.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.320]   So you will be OK
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.120]   in that situation.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.480]   But the scenario that you mentioned,
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.040]   where if you book
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.240]   a totally separate ticket
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.120]   on an airline,
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.000]   it's not a partner.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.200]   Yeah, you're going to have
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.640]   a problem in that case.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.920]   And so when I'm looking
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.120]   at positioning,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.200]   I tend to be pretty conservative
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.480]   and I look at positioning
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.360]   the day before.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.160]   And so if I have a really valuable award
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.520]   to me flying from Chicago
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.720]   to Tokyo on ANA,
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.960]   I will probably look at positioning
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.080]   the night before and staying
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.680]   in an airport hotel in Chicago.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.600]   That way, if everything goes wrong,
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.040]   I can find another way
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.080]   to get to Chicago.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.280]   And I find that that can be
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.640]   a good use of free night
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.600]   certificates that come
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.200]   with various hotel credit cards
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.280]   because those free night certificates
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.160]   that you get every year
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.160]   are usually limited
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.080]   in terms of how many points per night
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.040]   they can be used for.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.040]   And so I'll frequently look at those
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.520]   as a great way to book an airport hotel,
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.560]   you know, for to get to that airport
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.880]   the night before on a positioning flight.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.920]   Like we said, though,
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.880]   if you have the ability
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.800]   to book on an alliance airline
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.320]   and an airline in the same alliance
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.600]   as your long haul flight,
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.360]   that would be your first option,
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.640]   your best option.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.320]   And leaving yourself plenty of time
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:42.000]   is obviously also a good tip.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.560]   If you don't want
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.600]   to leave the day before,
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.720]   you can't do that.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.000]   At least leave yourself
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.360]   plenty of wiggle room
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.480]   so that there's something else
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.600]   you can book if you need
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.520]   to drop back 10 yards and punt.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.200]   And again, that's very different
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:53.920]   than people that don't
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.800]   book a word travel.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.320]   You have to have the confidence
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.160]   and flexibility that you know
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.600]   you'll be able to book something else
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.720]   and the flexibility
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.000]   to change if you need to.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.080]   But but we often talk
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.520]   about positioning flights
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:06.720]   and how to book those
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.080]   and how to consider
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.200]   the flexibility of them.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.720]   I the way I gave the example
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.000]   is probably a poor one
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.120]   where I said, you know,
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.000]   book a United flight
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:14.880]   and an American Airlines
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.600]   flight as a backup.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.320]   Maybe I'd book that
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.360]   American Airlines flight
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.240]   first thing in the morning
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.120]   and a United flight
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.080]   as a backup later on.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.440]   So if my American flight
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.960]   ended up delayed by four hours,
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.080]   I could cancel that hop
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.520]   on the United flight
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.400]   because they partner
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.600]   with the example
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.720]   I gave out of Chicago.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.320]   But that's certainly
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.360]   a good consideration
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.240]   when you're considering
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.520]   how you want to book
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.640]   your positioning flights.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.960]   And how does this
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.240]   entire process change
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.320]   for someone who maybe
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.840]   doesn't care about business class,
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.120]   wants to take more trips
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.720]   and flies economy or
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.680]   or where does premium
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.880]   economy fit in here?
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.520]   How do you think about
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.720]   the various classes
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.760]   and how it might affect
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.520]   redeeming your points?
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.400]   Yeah, that's a really good question
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.640]   because economy class awards.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.600]   So when I when I got
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.800]   into this world of miles
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.920]   and points and I was new to it
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.200]   before I actually
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.640]   redeem miles and points at all,
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.560]   I never even knew
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.520]   that flatbed seats
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.640]   existed on an airplane.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.160]   My wife and I traveled
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.800]   by the shoestring kind of budget
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   and did a lot of backpacking
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.640]   style things and just went
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.520]   wherever the cheapest
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.040]   airfares would take us.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.600]   And so I long, long,
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.440]   long traveled in economy class
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.320]   and appreciate
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.240]   the desire to travel more.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.200]   And when I got into this,
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.040]   initially, I thought it was crazy
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.080]   that people redeemed miles
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:28.960]   and points for business
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.840]   in first class because
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.720]   the front end of the plane
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.600]   gets there the same time
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.200]   as the back end of the plane.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.240]   So it doesn't make that
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.120]   much of a difference.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.640]   I thought anyway,
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.240]   over time, I realized
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.680]   that the difference in pricing
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.200]   between economy class awards
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.560]   and business class awards
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.640]   is far less than the difference
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.320]   in pricing with cash.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.600]   And so over time,
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.720]   it became apparent to me
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.840]   that it just made more sense
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.200]   to book business class flights
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.640]   because the cost difference
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.760]   was not that big.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.800]   And there are a lot of ways
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.320]   to earn more miles and points.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.880]   So I didn't necessarily
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.400]   have to sacrifice traveling
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.200]   as much as it was
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.000]   that I wanted to.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:02.960]   And my initial thought
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.080]   was exactly what you said,
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.520]   that I'd like to just travel
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.480]   as much as I can
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.800]   rather than focusing on comfort.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.720]   So I'll say that
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.760]   that certainly is something
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.360]   that I've changed on over time.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.560]   And when it comes to redeeming
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.160]   flights in economy class,
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.120]   there are situations
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.640]   where it can be a phenomenal value,
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.280]   particularly if you're located
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.240]   in a small airport,
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.760]   not a major airport hub,
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.880]   and/or you're traveling
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:25.520]   at a peak time.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.240]   There are times where
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.760]   you can get incredible value
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.040]   out of your miles and points.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.080]   There are other times, though,
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.200]   where it doesn't present
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.240]   fantastic value,
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.600]   especially as compared
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:34.320]   to booking through
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.280]   credit card portals.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.200]   I frequently run into
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.160]   situations where I say,
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.760]   well, using my chase points
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.200]   at one and a half cents per point,
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.400]   I could actually probably pay
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.440]   a little bit less
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.640]   than the cost of an award ticket.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.760]   I was just looking at an award
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.960]   last night where that was the case.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.440]   And I said, well,
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.240]   maybe I'm better off
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.200]   using my points
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.640]   at one and a half cents per point
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.040]   than booking an economy class flight.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.960]   So you'll have to look at that
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.400]   and shop around in the same way
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.680]   that we talked about before.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.720]   That said, there are plenty
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.640]   of good economy class sweet spots.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.760]   And premium economy
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.960]   is something that
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.840]   I think hasn't been
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.200]   written about very much
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.440]   and explored very much comparatively,
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.440]   because until recently,
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.800]   a lot of airline programs
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.240]   didn't have an award chart
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.400]   for premium economy tickets.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.040]   It was something that
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.480]   not all airlines offered.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.920]   And they still probably
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.960]   don't all offer
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.400]   a premium economy experience.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.760]   And there's huge variance
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.720]   in what that means
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.000]   from one airline to another.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.600]   But it's becoming
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:26.880]   more and more prevalent.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.320]   And I think that premium economy
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.920]   is actually a sweet spot
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:30.960]   that doesn't get
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.840]   talked about enough,
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.520]   because in many cases,
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.480]   the experience of flying
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.920]   premium economy is very similar
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.600]   to what a first class flight
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.280]   within the United States is.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.160]   So it's significantly
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:40.880]   more comfortable
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.800]   than a regular economy class flight.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.080]   And with many programs,
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.600]   premium economy doesn't cost
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.520]   much more than an economy class flight.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.960]   And I think the level of comfort
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.160]   it probably provides
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.560]   exceeds the difference in price.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.200]   And so I think that's
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.800]   something worth considering.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.680]   And, you know, again,
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.560]   when I go back to the fact
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.800]   that I started this out,
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.160]   anticipating that I would
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.680]   only fly an economy class,
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.400]   actually.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.040]   And over time,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:03.680]   I came to realize,
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.320]   well, you know,
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.000]   the additional outside value
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.800]   I get out of flying
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.760]   more comfortably
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.640]   is worth it to me
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.920]   to redeem more points.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.600]   And so you may find
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.240]   that same thing
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.760]   to be true with premium economy.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.440]   And in economy class,
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.360]   I think the thing to consider
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.920]   is it really, really pays
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.880]   to know your various
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.920]   partner programs,
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.960]   because the U.S.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.240]   based programs in general
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.680]   do not have the best
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.720]   economy class pricing
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.240]   for international awards.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.040]   Now, domestically,
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.000]   sometimes those U.S.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.560]   based programs
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.440]   are your only option
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.960]   for booking economy class awards,
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.000]   depending on whether
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.120]   they release availability
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.160]   to partners or not.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.280]   But internationally,
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.480]   it's almost always
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.200]   going to be the case
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:39.920]   that you're going to pay
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.120]   far fewer miles
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.400]   with the right transfer
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.280]   partner programs
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.200]   in economy class, especially.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.560]   So you'll want to learn
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.440]   about those things
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.320]   and look at sales.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.840]   Air France, KLM, Flying Blue,
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.720]   for instance,
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.640]   frequently offers promo awards
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.120]   every month.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.800]   They offer promo rewards.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.400]   And very often
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.760]   there are awards on sale
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.120]   from U.S. cities
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.040]   in economy class at great prices.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.120]   I mean, we're talking 10, 12,
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.200]   15000 miles one way to Europe,
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.120]   plus the taxes and fees,
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.640]   which can be an amazing value,
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.920]   depending on where you're starting
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.200]   and when you're looking to travel.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.240]   But it does vary.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.520]   And so you do have to
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.480]   frequently compare
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.760]   against cash prices,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.960]   whereas the cash price
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.920]   of a business class ticket
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.640]   is almost always
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.080]   going to be many multiples.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.160]   The in terms of the
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.120]   number of cents per point
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:23.600]   you're going to get out
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.800]   of your points compared
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.560]   to the cost of the award ticket,
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.040]   at least when we're
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.320]   talking about saver awards
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.120]   with economy class,
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.160]   that's just not always true.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.760]   So you have to compare
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.200]   and see what your best option is.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.360]   Yeah, make sure it's a good deal.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.560]   But I will say I've seen
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.640]   a lot of availability in economy
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.000]   that is sometimes easier
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.040]   to find than business.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.760]   Now, I have a great point.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.440]   It's a little bit of a catch question,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.560]   because I know they answer
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.360]   to some extent,
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.800]   but to someone listening that says,
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.560]   Nick, this all sounds great,
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.600]   but I have kids.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.400]   Like, how does that
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.360]   change the whole thing?
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.480]   What do you?
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:54.960]   Yeah, you know,
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.800]   and that is something
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.160]   that I have direct experience with,
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.760]   because my wife and I started
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.160]   this travel game without kids.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.840]   And so our very first
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.280]   award flight together
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.880]   was a first class award.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.640]   We had never flown in business class,
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.240]   even forget about first class.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.960]   And and that hooked us into this game.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.320]   And and so we played the game
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.560]   pretty hard for a few years,
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.080]   traveling around just the two of us.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.280]   And then, yeah, the game changed
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.360]   a lot when we had first one kid.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.880]   And now we have to have a six year old
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.680]   and a three year old.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.800]   And it is a lot different.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.000]   In fact, on our frequent
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.120]   mile around the air show,
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.160]   we've talked about points
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.160]   for family travel episode 174.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.520]   We did an entire episode
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.480]   on the best programs
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.240]   for lap infant tickets
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.520]   and your best options
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.280]   when you're traveling with family.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.720]   It definitely changes the game a lot
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.080]   in the sense that you need more seats.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.440]   And the point you made about
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.120]   economy class being easier
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.400]   to find multiple seats
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.680]   is a very relevant one
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.960]   for family travelers.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.480]   I think if you're looking to travel
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.040]   with three or four or five people,
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:51.920]   then finding award
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.200]   availability in economy
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.480]   or premium economy
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.080]   is generally far easier
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.360]   than finding availability
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.560]   in business class.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.000]   And so that's
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.200]   one of those times where, yeah,
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.800]   if you want to travel with a group,
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.160]   then traveling economy class
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.200]   might make more sense
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.240]   because it will give you
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.360]   many more options,
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.880]   a lot more availability
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.120]   in order to book multiple people.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.640]   But then there are also programs
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.160]   that are particularly good
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.400]   for releasing multiple seats.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.120]   And this is where
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.480]   the flexibility comes in.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.320]   And this makes a big difference
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.360]   in how I book travel.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.640]   These days, the flexibility
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.920]   that I mentioned before
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.280]   is more important now
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.160]   because I'm looking for
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.120]   three or four seats
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:27.920]   or I'm looking for
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.200]   four seats these days.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.640]   And so obviously
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.680]   being flexible is important.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.040]   And also finding more ways
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.080]   to maximize your miles
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.240]   and points is important, too,
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.640]   because now those tickets cost me,
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.800]   you know, the cost of four tickets.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.160]   You know, when I was a little kid,
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.520]   my uncle told me that marriage
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.880]   meant that a 50 cent hot dog
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.760]   would cost me a dollar
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.560]   because I'd have to buy
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.840]   one for her, too.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.240]   And and that means
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.760]   it means it's two dollars.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.800]   It's two dollars now.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.320]   And, you know, the prices
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:54.960]   have gone up a bit
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.920]   since he taught me that.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.400]   So so, yeah, it definitely requires
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.760]   earning more miles and points,
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.480]   and it requires
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.920]   a bit more flexibility
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.200]   in terms of deciding
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.720]   where and when you're going to travel.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   It also influences, you know,
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.440]   which flights are
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.560]   going to be acceptable for you.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.160]   When it was just my wife and I,
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.960]   if I had to make
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.320]   a couple of connections
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.600]   and take a couple of,
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.040]   you know, weird time to flights,
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.160]   that was no big deal.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.600]   With kids, it's a little bit harder
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.640]   and direct flights are
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.000]   more valuable to me now
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.520]   than they were in the past.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.840]   And so you do have to consider
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.480]   which are going to be
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.320]   your best options for those things.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.680]   But it is doable.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.880]   You know, here I am
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.920]   with a family of four
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.680]   and we travel very frequently.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.320]   We travel quite a bit each year.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.680]   And this year, in fact,
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.360]   we've got lots of trips planned
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.600]   and we do find availability for four.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.720]   But it requires
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.840]   that constant searching
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.440]   and more of that flexibility
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.400]   that we talked about
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.360]   in terms of
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.640]   when you're willing to travel,
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.920]   how far in advance you plan,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.960]   how much planning you do.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.000]   I mean, it does require
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.600]   me to search more often.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.720]   And sometimes I'll get lucky
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.760]   and hit the jackpot
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.560]   on the first search.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.680]   But oftentimes
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.880]   I'll have to search quite a bit.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.520]   And that's also
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.720]   another piece of this
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.920]   is where flexibility
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.600]   becomes super important to me
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.720]   because not all programs
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.520]   are created equally
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.880]   on a flexibility standpoint.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.000]   Most of the major U.S.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.760]   airline programs, American,
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.440]   United, Delta, Southwest,
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.200]   allow free cancellations,
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.080]   whereas some
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.040]   international programs
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.320]   like Avianca Life Miles,
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:16.800]   for instance,
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.920]   will charge you $200
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.680]   a person to cancel a ticket.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.440]   And I didn't really think
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.120]   much about that at all
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.080]   for many years.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.840]   But then last year
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.200]   we had a trip booked to Fiji
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.240]   and we're literally
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.520]   in the rental car
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.040]   on the way to the airport
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.240]   when my six year old,
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.600]   who had seemed low energy
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.720]   for the last couple of days,
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.480]   but insisted he felt OK,
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.680]   let us know that he definitely
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.880]   didn't feel OK.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   And and, you know,
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.000]   he got sick in the car
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:42.880]   and we said, OK, well,
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.000]   now we have to cancel
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.200]   this entire trip to Fiji
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:45.920]   that we had planned.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.800]   And thankfully,
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.520]   we had booked it all
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.800]   with flexible miles and points
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.160]   where we were able to cancel it
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.760]   without paying any fees.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.040]   And so I consider
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.120]   that type of stuff more now
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.960]   than I did when it was just me
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.400]   or just my wife and I.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.720]   Those things are important to me.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.240]   So you've got to consider that,
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.680]   I think, when you're booking
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.200]   and look into, OK, well,
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.560]   which program is going to offer
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.080]   me a low cancellation fee
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.920]   or no cancellation fee
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.440]   because kids get sick all the time.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.160]   I don't know when
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.520]   that's going to happen,
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.160]   when I'm going to have
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:14.960]   to change plans.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.160]   So that's a consideration.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:16.560]   And there's a lot
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.360]   of other considerations.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.640]   I mentioned lap infant tickets
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.240]   and the cost of adding a lap
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.920]   infant to an award ticket
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.440]   can just vary tremendously
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.640]   from next to nothing
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.480]   to a thousand dollars or more,
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.600]   depending on which program
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.400]   you book through.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.840]   So knowing the best program
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.720]   for that, if you're going
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.480]   to travel with a lap infant,
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.560]   it can make a huge difference in cost.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.640]   Yeah, I definitely recommend
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.760]   if you have a lap infant
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.960]   to go listen to that episode.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.720]   We had one experience doing this
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.320]   and the award tools.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.440]   I actually think there's one
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.240]   one award tool
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.280]   that maybe does this now,
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.320]   but in general,
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:46.800]   they're not going
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.840]   to tell you these things.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.600]   And so I remember,
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.040]   you know, because some
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.080]   of the airlines say,
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.360]   oh, it's just 10% more
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.400]   miles for a lap infant.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.200]   And some say, no,
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.880]   you've got to buy the lap infant
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.320]   at, you know, a fraction
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.280]   of the, you know,
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.720]   the retail cash price
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.240]   of that business class seat.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.200]   And so we were looking
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.080]   to book a flight
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.040]   that we could have booked
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:05.840]   through three or four
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.120]   different programs.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.880]   And it turns out
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.600]   that the one that was
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.280]   the cheapest number of miles
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.440]   would have cost us a thousand dollars.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.040]   But the one that was 10%
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.360]   more miles cost us a hundred dollars.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.640]   And so for us,
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.760]   had we had we used
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.360]   the cheapest miles program,
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.240]   the total cost
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.040]   would have been higher.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.240]   Now, this is a small thing.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.280]   It only matters to people
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.560]   traveling with small kids.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.000]   And I will point out
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.520]   as we learned that
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.320]   relying on the bassinet on a flight,
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.440]   which many flights have,
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.880]   if you're flying,
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.040]   doesn't necessarily mean
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:37.840]   your child will fit
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:38.640]   in the bassinet.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.880]   So you may think
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.840]   you're getting a great deal,
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.280]   but the size of bassinets
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.560]   varied very widely.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.560]   And our daughter was actually
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.720]   age wise, fine for the bassinet,
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.840]   not size wise.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.640]   She did not fit.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.920]   Yeah, but backing up
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.800]   to people wanting
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.080]   these kind of aspirational
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.280]   business class awards.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.120]   I want to make sure
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:07:59.920]   they don't feel
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.520]   too much doom and gloom
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.560]   if they're flexible.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.560]   Do you think a family of four can,
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.280]   you know, with
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.880]   enough points and miles
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.160]   find great redemptions
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.600]   to travel internationally
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.400]   in business class?
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.800]   Yeah, they absolutely can.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.920]   I mean, like I said,
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.800]   we do it pretty frequently.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.440]   I went to Europe
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.720]   three times last year.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.000]   This year, we're going to Europe
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.440]   and Africa for about a month.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.040]   And all of our long haul flights
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:21.920]   are in business class
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.880]   and flatbed seats.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.240]   And we do that quite a bit every year.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.840]   We take a few trips like that.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.120]   It's definitely doable.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.640]   It's just a matter of finding
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.000]   which awards are available.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.600]   And also, you know, you mentioned
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.280]   we mentioned lap infant tickets,
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.960]   but also some programs offer
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.440]   more advantageous pricing
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.040]   for children's tickets.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.480]   Air France KLM Flying Blue
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.680]   is a good example where
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.520]   children between age two and 11
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.880]   pay 25% less than adult fares.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.760]   So and we're talking
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.880]   about the number of miles
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.440]   they charge 25% fewer miles
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.480]   for a child ticket
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.520]   than an adult ticket.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.440]   And so Air France KLM Flying Blue,
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.360]   for instance, to from the United States
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.640]   to Europe at this point,
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.800]   charges from 50,000 miles
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.040]   one way for an adult ticket.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.920]   But you'll pay 12,500 miles
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.560]   less than that.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.720]   So you'll pay less than 40,000 miles
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.320]   for a ticket for a child.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.480]   And so knowing that
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.360]   and knowing that, OK,
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.400]   well, there is an opportunity
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.520]   where I might be able to get
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.600]   a particularly solid deal.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.360]   That's helpful because,
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.320]   like you said before,
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.520]   you may look and say, OK,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.400]   well, this award looks
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.600]   cheaper than that award.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.480]   If you don't know that
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.560]   you could save on the children's tickets
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.400]   by using the right program.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.840]   So that's where it pays to kind
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.120]   of know your programs a bit
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.280]   and also know which programs
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.200]   are more likely to release more seats.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.880]   Air France KLM is a good example
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.080]   where they frequently have
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.200]   a lot of seats available
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.800]   when they have seats available.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.400]   JetBlue is one that
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.080]   tends to internationally
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.520]   have several seats available.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.400]   If they're going to have business
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.000]   class seats available anyway,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.200]   they tend to have
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.320]   a number of seats available.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.600]   Now, booking them through JetBlue
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.720]   is not the best deal.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.160]   You'd want to book those
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.240]   through Qatar Avios.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.320]   And that'll be your best option
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.920]   for that particular program.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.760]   But again, those types of knowledge
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.440]   of those types of partnerships
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.440]   and which ones are going to have that
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.640]   is going to be helpful.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.160]   And again, the flexibility
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.000]   is going to be a huge piece of that, too.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.520]   But it definitely is doable.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.280]   Like I said, we do it very frequently.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.240]   We've done a lot of times.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.240]   And in fact, I find
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.520]   and this is kind of going back
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.560]   to the business class thing,
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.480]   but I find that it's far easier
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.400]   to travel with children
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.800]   in business class than it was when
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.880]   we primarily traveled in economy class
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.000]   because it gives you some more space
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:30.720]   to move around.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.800]   It gives the flatbed seat
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.240]   where the kid can fall asleep
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.600]   and not be laying all over you.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.600]   So that makes the trip
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.240]   far easier also on us.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.240]   So that's something that we consider
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.520]   when we're booking our trips.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.200]   We did just recently take that long flight
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.800]   to Honolulu from Newark.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.720]   There was 10 hours in economy class.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.240]   And we said, well, it's a good reminder
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.080]   why we collect lots of miles and points
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.760]   so that we can frequently travel
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.040]   more comfortably than that
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.960]   when we're on long flights like those,
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.400]   because it definitely makes
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.160]   a huge difference in the experience.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:00.880]   But there are a number
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.680]   of other programs, too,
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.560]   that very frequently
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.520]   offer multiple seats.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.280]   British Airways often does,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.360]   though they're known for high surcharges.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.280]   If you depart countries in Europe
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.800]   other than the United Kingdom,
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.560]   then the surcharges are typically
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.360]   pretty reasonable.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.800]   Booking through American Airlines
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.560]   or booking through Alaska Airlines,
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.640]   and they often have enough seats
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.080]   for a family of four, at least.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.960]   Finnair frequently has availability
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.120]   for a number of passengers.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.640]   Now, this stuff is going to ebb and flow.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.400]   So those examples I gave today,
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.360]   tomorrow, maybe you won't
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.800]   find anything at all.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.960]   But there are numerous airline programs
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.560]   that do release multiple seats.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.480]   The US based programs in general
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   are not as good about that
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   as many of the various foreign airlines,
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.000]   though that's not always bad news
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.520]   because the flight experience
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.880]   on a lot of foreign airlines
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.720]   is frequently a little bit better
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.800]   than the US based airlines.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.080]   And I said that, but there are tools
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.240]   you could use to find multiple seats on,
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.200]   for instance, United.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.520]   United releases a lot of availability
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.640]   relatively close in
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.240]   and some of their flights to Europe.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.480]   I we've more than once flown United
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.080]   between the United States and Europe
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.440]   and found four seats and,
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.120]   you know, in a premium cabin with them.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.480]   So it's doable.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.600]   It varies, though.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.200]   If you want to fly Emirates first class
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.400]   and have a shower on the plane,
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.200]   you're not going to find
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.680]   seats for a family of four.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.280]   You're going to have to probably book
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.480]   business class and hope that
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.880]   maybe you can upgrade a person or two.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.120]   But there are limitations like that
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.800]   where you won't necessarily be able to book
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.480]   some of the splashiest flights,
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.600]   but there's plenty of good,
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.960]   comfortable experiences out there.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.320]   Yep, and to that United example,
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.840]   I think it's a great reminder.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.960]   You could book the economy flight
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.240]   and then keep checking.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.400]   And if the business class flight
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.160]   opens up in the last two weeks,
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.560]   transfer a few more chase points to United
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.120]   or whatever airline you booked it through
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.400]   and then, you know,
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.800]   rebook that award in business class.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.320]   And so a couple of notes.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.400]   One, I always like to book
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   unless the airline requires it
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.040]   a one way award or two one way awards.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.480]   And the only caveats for me,
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.840]   and I'm curious if you have any,
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.360]   are I don't like to do it
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.280]   if the carrier requires it.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.760]   So like ANA has a lot of round trip awards.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.280]   And then I don't like to do it
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.320]   if the cancellation fees are kind of per ticket
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:10.960]   and they're high.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.880]   Then if you had a round trip,
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.760]   it might be on Avianca $200 to cancel.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.800]   But if you had two one ways,
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.760]   it might be $400.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.360]   But I find that cancelling something online
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.600]   and rebooking it is so much easier
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.720]   if you booked a one way
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.840]   than if you're trying to cancel
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.480]   one leg of a round trip for a lot of airlines,
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.160]   especially some of the international ones.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.920]   Yeah, that's a great point.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.360]   Actually, this goes back to
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360]   some of the flexibility that we talked about.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.560]   It's not actually flexibility,
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.680]   but it's kind of a flexibility
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.680]   in the way you think about booking trips.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.680]   Because yeah, almost all of our trips
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.960]   are booked as separate one ways.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.040]   And not only are they booked as separate one ways,
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.160]   but a departure from the way
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.920]   most people plan trips is that
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.360]   I'll just book one direction
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.880]   because I see four seats.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.880]   And that's something that if you have a family,
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.240]   if you're traveling with a family,
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.720]   you have to jump on it when you see availability
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.960]   and not wait until you find
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.000]   all of the seats you need
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.920]   in both directions necessarily.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.760]   If you see a great deal
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.360]   for your family in one direction,
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.480]   you got to book that
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.440]   and then continue to look
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.360]   for the other direction later on.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.560]   And so I definitely do that very frequently
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.720]   because it's hard to find multiple seats.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.840]   If you're traveling as a family,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.040]   as we typically are,
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.560]   it's hard to find four seats
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.720]   on the exact dates you need
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.880]   in both directions at one time.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.480]   You're going to probably need to book
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.080]   the one that you see today
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.360]   and then just start looking
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.520]   for the other direction day after day.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.480]   And if you book things
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.240]   that are flexible and cancelable,
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.760]   then at least you have the opportunity
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.040]   to get those miles and points back
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.000]   if it doesn't work out.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.360]   But I find that more often than not,
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.720]   if you're persistent with it,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.080]   you can find those things.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.840]   So that's, I think,
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.600]   something you really want to consider
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.400]   when you're booking.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.720]   I always book separate one ways.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.560]   You made a good point that programs
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.960]   that charge high cancellation fees per ticket,
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.240]   you may want to think differently,
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.720]   but also think about perhaps in some cases,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.640]   like Air Canada Aeroplane, for instance,
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.120]   will offer flexible tickets for more miles.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.400]   And so you may pay more miles up front
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.560]   for the ability to cancel
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.000]   or change for free later on.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.480]   And so that can be a technique
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.840]   that's worth using.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.040]   If you find something that you say,
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.280]   oh, this isn't necessarily perfect
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.880]   or there's economy class availability,
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.560]   but not business class availability.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.040]   Let me book the flexible economy class award.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.960]   And then if I find business class
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.800]   availability opens up, oh, great.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.920]   Then I can change to that.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.600]   Like you said, transfer a few more miles.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.680]   If I need to, I do that very frequently
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.760]   with Air Canada Aeroplane specifically
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.040]   because they have so many
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.640]   different airline partners.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.840]   They have more airline partners
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.840]   than any airline program in the world.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.440]   So even if I don't find
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.880]   that perfect award up front,
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.160]   I know there's a decent chance
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.520]   that I'll find it later on.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.680]   And even if I can't find
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.280]   the best pricing immediately,
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.560]   I'll know I'll probably be able
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.000]   to find it eventually if I look.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.160]   So I'll lock in something that kind of works
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.560]   and then look as we get closer to change it.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.320]   And we mentioned that award availability
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.680]   close in is often better.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:57.920]   And so you'll see opportunities often
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.080]   within a few days or weeks of travel
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.280]   to be able to get that premium cabin award
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.160]   if that's what you're after.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.560]   And this is especially true
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.000]   if you're trying to book an award, right?
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.200]   As the calendar releases
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.640]   and you're going for two weeks,
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.440]   the calendar is not going
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.640]   to release for both dates.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.560]   So book one, wait two weeks
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.360]   till they release it.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.920]   One hack that I recently learned
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.960]   that I haven't thought about
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.240]   how it would apply to awards,
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.280]   but it definitely applies
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.880]   to traveling with children
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.160]   is a friend of mine said, look,
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.080]   we were always looking for business class,
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.440]   but it's sometimes hard
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.720]   and it's super expensive.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.480]   And they probably play more
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.280]   in the cash world than the points world.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.960]   But they said the cost
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.480]   of four business class tickets,
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.160]   whether it's points or miles,
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.520]   is way more than the cost
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.280]   of six economy tickets.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.560]   And so they often book six tickets.
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.400]   And depending on the airline,
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.280]   you may or may not be able
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.880]   to book a ticket without a person.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.920]   But, and I don't think
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.400]   this is crossing any lines
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.600]   or ethical issues,
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.400]   but you can book a second extra seat
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.840]   for passengers of size
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.400]   and for a musical instrument.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.440]   There are reasons.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.960]   So I don't think you could just book one
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.440]   for a fake person who's not going to board.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.120]   But what they do is they book,
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.320]   oftentimes on a flight
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.760]   where there's three and three,
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.280]   they book all six.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.880]   And so they couldn't find
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.240]   the business class availability
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.760]   or it was way too expensive,
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.680]   but they book six seats in economy.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.600]   And then the kids can lie down.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.840]   It's a little bit more space to move around.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.640]   And so oftentimes I can tell you
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.400]   that finding six economy seats
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.640]   on some flights might be difficult,
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.080]   but it might be easier than finding
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.280]   four business class seats
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.160]   on that same flight.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.800]   Oh yeah, no, that is a very good hack.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.480]   And like you said, I think you're fine.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.680]   You can book an extra seat.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.840]   That's a legitimate thing that people do.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.000]   And yeah, that would be a far
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.680]   more economical way to do it.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.000]   And, you know, that's a great example
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.360]   of thinking outside the box
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.360]   a little bit to give a similar,
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.680]   but different hack that I've used
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.600]   with my family is with Southwest,
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.240]   because Southwest offers the ability to,
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.240]   if you book a one to get away plus fare,
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.360]   which I know Southwest,
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.400]   we're talking about domestic flights.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.680]   We're not talking about business class here.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.280]   We're just talking about economy class.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.520]   But if you book a one and get away plus fare,
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.720]   you can do a same day change
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.600]   to a different flight.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.000]   And so what I'll frequently do
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.800]   is book the cheapest flight that day,
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.240]   looking to change at midnight
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.200]   on the day of travel,
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.880]   when I can make a free change
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.720]   to the more desirable time or flight.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.800]   And so I once in a while
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.200]   have booked four seats for somebody else
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.320]   that may or may not make the trip
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.680]   on the flight that I actually want,
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.160]   because if they cancel after midnight,
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.360]   then I can take those four seats
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.480]   when I do a same day switch.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.600]   So I've been known,
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.960]   Justin Bieber has been on a couple
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.640]   of Southwest reservations before
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.240]   that he hasn't flown.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.680]   But, you know, that's like you said,
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.040]   thinking outside the box a little bit
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.160]   as to how you might be able
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.440]   to accomplish those things is great.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.600]   I love the six seats in economy class,
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.880]   because that really would make
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.600]   a big difference.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.160]   And you're right.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:54.880]   In some cases,
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.320]   that will be far cheaper
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.920]   than booking business class awards.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.600]   So that's a that's a smart hack.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.600]   And by the way,
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.880]   if you do it on Southwest,
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.640]   or I believe Alaska,
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.320]   if you book on Alaska
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.080]   or Southwest, I believe,
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   and you book an extra seat
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.160]   and the flight isn't full,
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.080]   you can reach out and they'll refund you
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.040]   on those extra seats
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.240]   on Southwest and Alaska.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.080]   So you're traveling with kids
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:18.640]   and you're like,
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.240]   "Wow, this flight isn't that full."
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.360]   Book an extra seat
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.480]   and then you can get a refund.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.200]   So you actually get
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.800]   two extra seats for free.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.480]   So great option.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.840]   Fantastic option.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.760]   If you're trying to find a kid hack.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.960]   Obviously, there's no business class
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.840]   in Southwest anyway.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.280]   So that's not your option.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.320]   Right.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.880]   So I guess I have two wrap ups.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.800]   One, when you're doing all this,
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.320]   what advice do you have for people
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.640]   on when is it a good use of points?
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.320]   Is there a target value
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.520]   you're trying to convert cash
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.360]   to points or how do you think about that?
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.160]   Well, there's two different pieces to that.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.040]   First of all, yes.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.040]   I mean, I want to generally
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.560]   get a good value for my points
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.240]   if I'm going to invest my time
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.240]   and effort into earning miles and points,
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.120]   then I want to make sure
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.040]   that I'm getting a good return on that.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.080]   And you have to consider
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.760]   that it could be earning cash back.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.040]   And so I want to make sure
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.120]   that my award redemptions
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.560]   are exceeding the value
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.280]   I could have gotten
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.040]   if I just used a credit card
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.320]   to earn cash back.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.040]   So I generally want to redeem my points
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.440]   at a value of at least two cents per point.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.040]   Now, figuring that out
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.160]   is a little bit murky,
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.600]   because as we said before,
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.320]   you know, if you're booking
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.240]   that first class flight on Etihad
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.520]   from Houston to Abu Dhabi,
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.080]   it's difficult to determine
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.480]   how much that's exactly worth,
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.440]   because it's worth more
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.200]   than the cost of an economy class ticket.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.240]   But it's probably not worth
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.080]   the $18,000 to me.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:36.800]   So there's a little bit
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.400]   of murky math involved in that.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.520]   But I generally want to make sure
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.880]   that I am getting at least
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.240]   two cents per point in value,
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.680]   because I could have easily used
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.680]   a two percent cash back card
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:46.880]   instead of using whatever
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.960]   credit card program
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.800]   I had used initially.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.880]   So that's part of it for me.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.040]   But the other part of it for me
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.200]   is that I also consider
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.640]   the ease or difficulty
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.320]   of replenishing the points.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.440]   And so, you know,
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.120]   if it's a type of point
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.320]   that is very easy to earn more of,
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.480]   and that's most types of miles
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.840]   and points, to be honest,
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.720]   then I'm at least slightly
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.320]   less stringent in terms
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.920]   of how I redeem them.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.440]   I'm a maximizer, so I like to get
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.680]   the best possible value that I can.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.600]   But I also know that
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.200]   there's lots of ways to earn
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.560]   lots and lots of miles and points.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.600]   I mean, every year,
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:26.560]   my wife and I earn
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.160]   millions of miles and points
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.520]   through new credit card
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.920]   welcome offers and referral bonuses
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.280]   and category bonuses
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.400]   and strategic spending
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.960]   in order to increase our rewards
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.800]   and buying and reselling things,
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.240]   you know, buy things and resell them
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.920]   in order to earn a small profit
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.920]   and earn lots of miles and points.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.240]   So I don't only consider
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.000]   the target cents per point.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   I also try to target
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.080]   lots and lots of low hanging fruit
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.320]   in terms of new welcome bonuses.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.200]   But I like to get
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.560]   as much value as possible.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.400]   And the one thing I don't like to do
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.520]   is to redeem my points
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.640]   for very low value
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.480]   when I know I'm going to often
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.840]   be able to redeem them for more.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.120]   And here's what I mean by that.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.600]   People that are very much
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600]   into award travel often love Hyatt.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.600]   Hyatt is a hotel chain
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.520]   and they offer a great award chart.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.040]   Most other hotel programs
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:15.840]   don't have an award
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.040]   chart at all anymore.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.400]   Hyatt has a very reasonably
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.440]   priced award chart,
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.120]   many incredible properties.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:21.920]   If you're looking to stay
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.440]   at very high end places,
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.000]   you can stay at
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.200]   some incredible properties
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.800]   for very reasonable award rates.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.560]   And by the same token,
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.920]   if you're looking to stay
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.920]   in very inexpensive properties
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.040]   from an award perspective
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.640]   at the low end of their award chart,
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.880]   they have amazing deals there as well.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.400]   And so I know that I'll
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.320]   almost always come into
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.080]   lots of situations where I'll get
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.760]   better than two cents per point
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:44.720]   out of my chase points
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.480]   by transferring to Hyatt.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.000]   So I don't really want
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.280]   to redeem my chase points
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.800]   at any less value than that.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.520]   And that's, in fact,
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.680]   why I don't often consider
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.880]   using their travel portal
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.240]   at one and a half cents per point,
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.280]   because every year
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.440]   I come into so many situations
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.800]   where Hyatt can give me
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.240]   more value than that,
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.360]   that I don't really want
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.040]   to accept less value
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.160]   for my chase points.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.320]   So I tend to focus
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.600]   those mostly on Hyatt,
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.960]   which also, by the way,
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.400]   is great for family travelers,
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.640]   because Hyatt not only does
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.920]   do they have good award
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.200]   pricing for their hotels,
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.040]   but they also offer the ability
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.800]   in many cases to book a suite
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.600]   with your points
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.040]   and sometimes a premium suite.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.480]   And as a family traveler,
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.520]   that's huge to me,
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.360]   because if I can lock in a suite
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.720]   at the time of booking,
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.520]   then I know I'm going
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.720]   to have the space we need.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.760]   It's so nice to have
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.040]   a separate room and a door
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.400]   to be able to close
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.680]   in order to separate space
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:36.960]   from parents and kids.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.840]   So I tend to to spend time
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.680]   thinking about those types of things
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.040]   when I'm considering
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.080]   how many cents per point.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.560]   And I also, again, have to compare
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.600]   against cash prices
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.120]   for reasonable options.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.800]   So when I say two cents per point,
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.600]   I'll say, OK, well,
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.240]   what is my next best option?
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.360]   Would I book this?
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.720]   Sorry, I'm not necessarily
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.080]   comparing against only
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.440]   the cheapest possible flight,
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.240]   because if it's a flight
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.280]   that I wouldn't have booked
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.960]   because it's awful timing
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.840]   or a bunch of stops,
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.560]   and that's maybe not
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.560]   the best comparison point for me.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.920]   And similarly, you have
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.040]   to consider the flexibility.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:09.600]   You know, when it comes
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.360]   to hotels, for instance,
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.040]   I rarely ever consider booking
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.040]   a nonrefundable cash rate.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.640]   And when I use hotel points,
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.520]   I get the flexibility
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.560]   of being able to cancel up
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.760]   until a couple of days
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.960]   before the stay.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.000]   And I value that.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.760]   So I'm more likely to compare
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.000]   against those other flexible rates.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.040]   So I'll consider that
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.000]   both with flight awards
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:28.960]   and hotel awards.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.600]   But yeah, I mean,
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.480]   I don't want to redeem
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.080]   for less than two cents per point.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.760]   And I tend to like to redeem
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.920]   for three or four cents or more.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.920]   And that's usually pretty easy,
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.200]   particularly if you're redeeming
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.320]   for premium cabins,
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.640]   because those premium cabin flights
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.480]   do often yield a fantastic value
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.440]   versus the cash price.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:45.920]   What about you?
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.120]   I mean, do you have a target?
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.080]   You have like a minimum
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:48.960]   at two and a half cents
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.240]   or what do you have?
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.080]   No, I've typically said to
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.320]   that that's been my threshold.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.080]   Also, I may did a little presentation
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.520]   for a wealth management firm
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.560]   that was like, can you teach us
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.440]   about points and miles?
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.200]   And I said over to over
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.400]   or equal to two cents,
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.360]   like you feel good.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.840]   The only caveat I'll put on there
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.880]   is that there are people
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.840]   that have played this game
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.440]   and some of them are listening now
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.480]   and have emailed me and said,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.760]   gosh, I've accumulated millions
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:12.560]   and millions of points.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.720]   Just got laid off from my job.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.240]   I found this great redemption,
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.680]   but I can't get the two cents.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.760]   But cash is tight.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.480]   Go on the trip.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.560]   At the end of the day,
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.280]   I think the points are here
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.320]   to allow you to
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.840]   have incredible experiences.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.480]   And so can you find ways
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.440]   to get more value?
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.240]   Yes.
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.640]   But I would rather you use the points
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.080]   than end up in a situation
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.200]   like maybe I have,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.840]   that I've probably hoarded my points,
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.120]   focused a little bit too much
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.480]   on the optimizing
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.400]   and not as much on going.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.640]   And so I did this great episode
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.480]   with Bill Perkins,
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.720]   who wrote this book called Die With Zero.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.640]   And most people listening
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.360]   have probably heard it.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.640]   I think it's the most popular episode
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.520]   we've ever done.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.400]   And I was explaining
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.920]   this trip I wanted to take.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.560]   And I was like, yeah,
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:58.880]   but I don't know
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.680]   if I can get a good deal.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.920]   He goes, you're optimizing
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:02.560]   for the deal.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.320]   You're not optimizing for the trip.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.920]   And you should be optimizing
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.120]   if it's important for your family
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.960]   to go on a trip together this year.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.320]   Maybe it's more points.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.360]   Use the more points.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.720]   Maybe it's not a good deal,
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.320]   but optimize for taking the trip.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.360]   And so I think
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.720]   if you have enough resources
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.240]   that it's we're going to take the trip.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.400]   It's just do I do points or cash this time?
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.120]   Maybe you can hold a higher bar.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.200]   But if you don't have that luxury
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.200]   for the trip at hand,
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.640]   optimize for taking the trip,
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.040]   optimize for enjoying the moment.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.400]   Go back and listen to that episode
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:33.520]   if you need some encouragement
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.040]   with a little stronger language.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.040]   Forewarned.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.800]   It has an explicit reminder
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.440]   at the beginning.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.280]   But Bill really knocked it into me.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.400]   And funny enough,
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.400]   about 3 days after that episode,
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.600]   my wife and I booked a trip
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.360]   that wasn't as optimal as normal.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.080]   But we took a trip with 4 to Europe.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.920]   We found roundtrip tickets
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.800]   in business class for 4 people both ways.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.240]   So it all worked out.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.640]   Yeah, I think that's a really good point.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:01.760]   And it goes back to what we talked about
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.600]   a little bit about flexibility,
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.080]   because there's also this analysis paralysis
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.280]   that you can get into and say,
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.040]   "Oh, well, am I getting the best deal?
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:09.920]   And which deal could I get
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.880]   that's a little bit better?"
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.240]   And then I think newcomers
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.600]   often have a fear that,
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.120]   "Oh, are people going to judge me
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.720]   because I didn't get a great deal?
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.160]   I didn't get the best deal."
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.520]   Or they may feel nervous
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.400]   about talking about it.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.200]   And I'll say, "No, no, no.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.680]   I mean, if you're using your miles and points,
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.280]   enjoy that joy of free.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.600]   Enjoy that ability to take a trip
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.040]   that you wouldn't have otherwise.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.560]   There's no shame in that.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.840]   And not every redemption
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.000]   is going to be the absolute optimized,
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.600]   most perfect redemption.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.200]   But you're probably more likely
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.880]   to remember that trip than you are
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.680]   the fact that you got 1.8 cents in value
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.560]   versus 2.3 cents in value out of the points.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.240]   So I totally agree with that.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.360]   And I think if you've got millions
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.160]   and millions of points,
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.600]   and there are certainly lots of people
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.840]   that'll use a credit card for years and years,
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.120]   maybe for their business
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.520]   and accumulate these huge piles of points.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.680]   And the points aren't going to grow in value.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.600]   They aren't going to appreciate it all.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.960]   The programs, in fact,
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.320]   will more likely devalue than increase in value.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.520]   So you want to put those points
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.280]   to use sooner rather than later.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.000]   And yeah, when I've built up a huge chunk
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.680]   of points in a particular program,
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.840]   I've been much more likely to accept less value
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.760]   because I do want to use those
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.760]   and keep my cash that I can invest
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.320]   and can appreciate and grow over time
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.320]   rather than spending the cash
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.120]   and holding the points,
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.120]   hoping that I'll get the perfect redemption someday.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.080]   So that's a really good point.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.120]   I don't want to use them
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.040]   towards really low value
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.520]   and kind of waste the time and effort
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.720]   I had put into earning them.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:33.280]   But you're right.
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.720]   I also don't want to sit on a massive pile of points
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.720]   that I'm not using and either not travel
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.880]   or use my money rather than use my points.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:44.080]   Yeah. Okay. I keep saying we got to wrap
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:44.960]   because we've been here for so long,
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.160]   but there's two last things.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.520]   One is we talked about flights this whole time.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.600]   We said, here are some ways not to redeem points.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.120]   Transfer partners are the ways to do it.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.400]   Flights, flights, flights.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.320]   Spent about two minutes on Hyatt.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.280]   I know that almost every transferable currency
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.320]   has a partner, at least one in the hotel groups.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.120]   Do you ever consider those as good ways
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.720]   to use points other than Hyatt,
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.840]   where I think we've kind of
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.760]   clearly established good value?
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:15.120]   I don't often look at transferring transferable currencies
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.720]   to hotel points.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.040]   And that's because hotel points,
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:19.920]   well, two reasons.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.600]   Number one, hotel points in general
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.440]   are worth far less than airline points
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.120]   from a cash perspective.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.120]   The programs just have it set up that way
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.840]   where most hotel points
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.680]   are worth less than a penny per point.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.720]   Now, in some cases,
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.640]   you can get multiple points when you transfer.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.240]   It varies from one transferable points program to another.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.200]   Like for instance,
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.040]   if you're transferring your Amex points to Hilton,
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:41.760]   it's not one-to-one.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.920]   You get more points when you transfer to Hilton
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.760]   and there's frequently transfer bonuses.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.480]   There are times when it can be reasonable enough.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:51.040]   And particularly if Amex is offering a transfer bonus
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.720]   to Hilton, that's one time
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.040]   where you can get a reasonable enough value
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.320]   out of your points.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.360]   But you have to consider
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.880]   that many of the hotel programs
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.320]   sell their points pretty cheaply.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:03.120]   Hilton is an example that they almost always
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.520]   have their points on sale for half a cent each.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.480]   So if you're transferring
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.480]   your Amex membership rewards points to Hilton
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.760]   and you're getting two Hilton points
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:12.160]   for every one Amex membership reward point,
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.440]   that's not a great deal
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.360]   because you could have used your pennies
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.360]   and bought those two points also.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.600]   So it's not as good of a redemption
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.360]   when they offer the right transfer bonus,
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.320]   then it can become a reasonable redemption,
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.080]   but it's not one that I typically look at.
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.560]   And the same can be said for Marriott and IHG.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.920]   They frequently sell their points
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.440]   for less than a penny a point.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.120]   So if I really wanted those points
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.320]   and I hadn't earned those points
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.840]   from the hotel programs,
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.760]   then I might consider cashing out my points
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.840]   at one cent per point and buying points
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.360]   and end up with more points
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.720]   than I would by transferring.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:46.880]   And Chase to IHG is a great example of this.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.160]   If you transferred your Chase points to IHG
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.680]   for every one Chase point,
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.680]   you're going to get one IHG point.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.800]   Whereas instead,
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.480]   if you cashed out your Chase points,
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.400]   every one Chase point will give you a penny
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.400]   and you can pretty frequently buy
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.480]   two IHG points for that one penny
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.360]   and end up with far more points.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.480]   - And when you say cash out,
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.080]   you mean just the statement credit
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:06.880]   or something like that?
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.040]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.000]   Which isn't a redemption
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   that I typically consider doing.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.560]   But again, if I were really in need of IHG points
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.760]   because they're frequently on sale
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:16.960]   for half a cent each,
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.440]   then I would consider cashing out Chase points
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.480]   for a statement credit
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.800]   and buying the IHG points I needed.
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.920]   Now, all that said,
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.520]   each of the various hotel programs
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.640]   have their own credit cards
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.000]   and often those credit cards
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.080]   offer good welcome bonuses.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.400]   And often with these hotel programs,
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.760]   they have more than one credit card
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.040]   and you might be able to get
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.800]   more than one of those credit cards.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.760]   So we certainly do use hotel points,
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.920]   but our hotel points in general
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.840]   are earned via welcome bonuses
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.160]   from the various chain credit cards.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.800]   Hyatt is the one example
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.480]   or the one exception rather,
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.880]   where I will transfer my transferable points
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.160]   to a hotel program.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.680]   Now, all that said,
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.360]   again, there are situations
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.960]   where you may have a great redemption
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.560]   and maybe you have almost enough points,
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.000]   but not quite enough points
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.760]   to redeem for the hotel award you want.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.520]   And then it really might make sense
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.400]   to transfer over.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.000]   If you need a few thousand more,
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.600]   10,000, 20, whatever it might be
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.840]   for a really valuable hotel stay,
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:13.680]   then yeah, by all means transfer over,
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.360]   top off and get that booked
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.360]   because that can yield enough value
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.560]   to make it worthwhile.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.240]   I just generally wouldn't consider
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.760]   transferring a large chunk
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:24.880]   of my transferable points
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:25.760]   to a hotel program.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.480]   Yep. Now my last thing is
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.920]   if someone listed this whole thing and said,
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.240]   "I really wish I could get this two,
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.840]   three, four, five cents of value,
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.120]   but it just sounds like so much work.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.080]   I don't have that much work."
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.480]   I wanna make sure people understand
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.840]   the alternative isn't just,
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.520]   "Okay, great, redeem it in the portal
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.640]   or a statement credit."
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.920]   There are people out there.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.000]   I don't know if you guys have any
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:46.640]   at Frequent Miler,
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:47.840]   but there are people you can pay
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.280]   to just do all of this for you,
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.280]   award booking services.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.520]   And so if someone's listening and thinking,
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.280]   "Gosh, I got a million points."
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.440]   The difference between getting two cents
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.560]   and one cent is like $100,000, right?
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.560]   Like, or maybe $10,000.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.160]   Sorry, sorry, $10,000.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.400]   But still, I mean, a $10,000 difference
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.920]   is worth paying somebody a few bucks.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.040]   $10,000. Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.880]   And so for a few hundred dollars,
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.560]   usually per person,
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.720]   so 150, $200 a person,
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:15.840]   you can say, "Hey, we wanna take
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.720]   a trip as a family.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.600]   We've got four people.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.200]   We want a five business class.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.240]   We're willing to go anywhere
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.280]   in Europe in July."
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.960]   Someone else will go
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.400]   and do all this searching for you
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.240]   and come back and say,
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.080]   "Here's an optimal way to do it."
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:31.440]   Usually you put about $25 deposit per person.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.600]   So you're not even spending the full amount
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.600]   to do the searching, just the deposit.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.000]   And so I'll just flag to anyone listening,
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.680]   we'll link to a few in the show notes
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.520]   that are options.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.720]   I don't know if you have any favorites
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.000]   that you've used before
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.120]   or referred people to,
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.760]   but that is an option
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.880]   where if spending $200 a person
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.560]   for four people, so $800,
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:55.440]   is the difference between getting $20,000
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.840]   or $10,000 of value from your points.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.360]   By all means, I think anyone listening
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.480]   can do the math to say
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.760]   that was a good ROI.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.160]   Yeah, no, for sure.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.480]   I don't have a lot of firsthand experience
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.760]   with award booking services
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.200]   because when I got into this,
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.800]   I taught myself how to do it
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.240]   and learned how to do it
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.600]   and enjoyed doing it,
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.120]   which I think is a big key
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.480]   because not everybody enjoys
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.080]   the hunting and the searching.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.280]   I enjoy the thrill of the hunt,
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.560]   but not everybody does.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.600]   And if you don't have
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:22.720]   a lot of extra time to do it,
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.560]   then I think an award booking service
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.080]   fills a really important need.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.440]   And I think your point
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.680]   that the amount of savings
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.640]   you can have in the sense
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.920]   that if you redeem your points
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:33.440]   just through the credit card portal,
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:33.920]   because you're like,
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.440]   "Oh, I don't want to bother with this."
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.960]   Then you may be giving up,
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.040]   that example is a great one,
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.400]   $10,000 in value
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.920]   that you could have
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:42.880]   for just paying somebody
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.480]   a couple hundred bucks a person
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.360]   to book it for you.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.440]   We don't offer award booking services
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.400]   at Frequent Miler,
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:49.280]   but there are lots
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.240]   of different ones out there,
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:50.720]   like you said,
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.080]   and you may be familiar
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:52.640]   and have a good list of them.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.600]   Yeah, I'll find a couple.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.880]   I'll link to them in the show notes.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.160]   Definitely.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.760]   But I will also send you back
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.440]   to the episode I did with Greg
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.960]   because the award tools
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.240]   have come so far.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.840]   A lot of these discovery tools
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.960]   have made it so easy
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.480]   to kind of get inspired
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.120]   that I think maybe 3 years ago,
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.560]   it would have been a lot more work.
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.840]   It's like search every route,
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.640]   every date.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:13.680]   That's gotten a lot better.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.520]   So it might seem like a lot of work.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.320]   And if you go back
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.520]   and listen to that episode with Greg,
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.800]   you might realize,
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:19.440]   "Actually, I could do
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.160]   some of this searching
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.440]   on my own pretty quickly."
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.200]   So this has been amazing.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.480]   If someone listening today
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.080]   has not been inspired
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.200]   to get good value
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:27.920]   out of their points,
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:28.880]   maybe made some changes
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:29.600]   to how they're thinking
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.480]   about planning,
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.600]   I would be surprised.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.080]   You mentioned a lot of episodes,
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.520]   but Nick, where can people find
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.560]   the stuff you're writing,

[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.160]   ask questions about this stuff.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.320]   You asked about award booking
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.440]   and people frequently will say,
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.320]   "Hey, I'm looking at this.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.520]   Is this a good option?
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.480]   Is there a better option?"
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.680]   And people help each other
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.120]   in our Frequent Miler group as well.
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.000]   But all those episodes
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:06.880]   that we've talked about,
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.440]   you can find us

[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.080]   podcast platforms.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.280]   Yep.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.560]   Whatever you're listening to now,
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.000]   highly recommend.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.360]   Thank you so much for being here, Nick.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.880]   Thank you very much.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:17.920]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.880]   Really enjoyed being here.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.480]   I appreciate the chance to sit down
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.680]   and talk miles and points with you.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.360]   Anytime.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.640]   And when you started talking
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.920]   about how easy it was
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.280]   for you to earn a lot more points,
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.560]   I'm like, "Hmm, I got an idea
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.760]   for another conversation."
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.040]   So we'll see how
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:31.840]   we can make that happen.
