[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   We come this evening to our consideration of the statement made by the Apostle Paul
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.760]   in the epistle to the Romans in the second chapter from verse 11 to verse 16.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.360]   From verse 11 to verse 16 in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, "For there
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.880]   is no respect of persons with God, for as many as have sinned without law shall also
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.260]   perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.680]   For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.480]   For when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.080]   these having not the law are alone to themselves, which show the work of the law written in
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:05.760]   their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.200]   accusing or else excusing one another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.440]   men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:29.700]   Now here we come to the fifth argument which the Apostle develops in this section with
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.680]   regard to this whole matter of the wrath of God.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.560]   Anxious as he is that all should realize that they are under the wrath of God, in order
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.580]   that they may hasten to hide themselves under the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ,
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.560]   he is dealing with every conceivable objection.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.440]   And here, I say, is the fifth with which he deals.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   Now he had been hinting at it in the last two verses of the previous section, in verses
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.840]   9 and 10, where he says in dealing with the punishments and the rewards, "Tribulation
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.120]   and anguish upon every soul of men that doeth evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile;
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.400]   but glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.160]   the Gentile."
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.120]   Now then, he takes up this statement of his about the Jew first and also to the Gentile,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.440]   which he has made twice because he regards it as so important.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.240]   But now he takes that up and deals with it itself in a more direct and specific manner.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.880]   He has, indeed, from the very beginning, been carrying this idea in his mind.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.140]   But so far, he has been concerned to emphasize different aspects of this judgment of God.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.480]   But here now, I say, he comes and deals with it quite openly.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.560]   And then, having dealt with this, he will go on and he will make specific, direct, and
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.960]   explicit charges against the Jews, starting in verse 17 and running on until the end of
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   the chapter.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.720]   Now, I was suggesting at the end last Friday evening that it is important for us to know
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.520]   how to read this particular statement that we are looking at.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.660]   And it does seem to me that the authorized version is most helpful here, and more helpful
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.920]   than the revised version or the revised standard version.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.040]   Because the authorized version, as you know, puts the statement that is found in verses
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.640]   13, 14, and 15 in brackets, indicating that it is a kind of parenthesis.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.720]   And I have no doubt at all that that is absolutely right and essential.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.360]   Because the statement in verse 16, "In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.900]   by Jesus Christ according to my gospel," rarely cannot be linked directly with verse
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.040]   15.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.560]   Because there we are told that the Gentiles, who show the work of the law written in their
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.060]   hearts, their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.640]   or else excusing one another, well, obviously, that is no reference to what happens on the
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.320]   day of judgment.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.520]   But what is dealt with in verse 16 is what is going to happen on the day of judgment.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.440]   The apostle in verse 15 is saying what is true of the Gentiles now, not what will be
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   true.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.360]   They will not be accusing or excusing one another on the day of judgment.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.400]   It will be too late for that kind of thing.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.160]   All will be so overwhelmed by the promulgation of the sentence that there will be no arguing
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.240]   with themselves or with one another.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.160]   It is quite inappropriate, therefore, to connect verse 15 with verse 16.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.120]   And it does seem to me, therefore, to be a real pity that these revised versions do not
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:16.040]   indicate clearly for the aid of all readers that this is a parenthesis.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:24.080]   But then there has been dispute many times as to where exactly the parenthesis begins.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.700]   Granting that there is a parenthesis and that verse 15 and 16 do not lead directly from
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.960]   one to the other, the question is where does the parenthesis begin.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.640]   Now the authorized version, as I say, says verse 30, but there are some who have argued
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.000]   for verse 40.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.980]   They think that the parenthesis starts there, so that you read like this, "For as many
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.080]   as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:04.000]   the law shall be judged by the law, for the law shall be justified in the day when God
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.980]   shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:20.760]   But there again it seems to me that the authorized version is absolutely right, because once
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:29.720]   more it seems to me you can't link the end of verse 13 with the statement of verse 16,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.520]   because the statement of verse 13 is that not the hearers of the law are just before
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.640]   God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.600]   Well, we know perfectly well that there is no such thing as a doer of the law.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.140]   No man does keep the law or ever has kept the law, so that there's no question of that
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.720]   being important on the day of judgment.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.120]   So clearly verse 13 doesn't lead directly to verse 16.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.320]   No, the authorized version is perfectly right.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.960]   It's verse 12 that connects with verse 16.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.440]   So we read it again like this, beginning at verse 11, "For there is no respect of persons
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.120]   with God, for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and as
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:26.680]   many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law in the day when God shall judge
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.840]   the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:40.160]   You notice that in verses 12 and 16 the theme is that of judgment, and therefore the parenthesis
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:47.440]   runs from the beginning of verse 13 to the end of verse 15.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.120]   The main statement, therefore, is the statement in verses 11, 12, and 16.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:01.440]   Then in the other verses, in the parenthesis, he elaborates it a bit, his main contention,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.160]   and not only that, he deals with possible objections that someone might bring forward,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.800]   indeed that the Jew might bring forward or the Gentile might bring forward.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.720]   And having disposed of them, he then completes the statement that he broke off at the end
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   of verse 12.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:26.080]   Very well, then, I think the simplest thing for us is to take it as it is thus put before
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.760]   us.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   We must look at the main statement first, and then consider the little argument of the
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.840]   parenthesis, which, as I indicated at the end last Friday, has often stumbled people,
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.160]   because it seems to tell us something about the situation of the Gentiles, who are not
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.800]   only outside the law, but who have never heard the preaching of the Christian gospel.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.080]   Very well, then, let's look at the main statement, and let me just take the statement
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.520]   as such first, and then look at its doctrine, at its teaching.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:12.200]   Verse 11 states the real principle, and the principle is this, "There is no respect
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.920]   of persons with God."
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.400]   Now, it's an interesting phrase, that respect of persons.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:31.760]   What it really means literally is this, "There is no lifting up of face where God is concerned."
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.040]   What that means is this, that as people stand in the presence of God with their heads and
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:42.200]   faces down because of a sense of shame, he hasn't his favorites, and he doesn't lift
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.440]   up the face of one.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.960]   God has no favorites, no respect of persons.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.120]   He doesn't lift up the face of one, and not do it in the case of the other.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:01.360]   Now, you must have noticed many times in reading through the scriptures, how constantly this
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.200]   particular statement is made with respect to God.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.480]   God is contrasted with men.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.320]   It's very difficult to find a man who doesn't have respect of persons.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.080]   That's one of the things that has happened to men as the result of the fall.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.360]   It's very difficult for any human being to give an honest judgment, an impartial judgment.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.200]   We are influenced by other considerations.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.180]   We are not only more lenient with ourselves than we are with other people.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:43.600]   We tend to shield our families, and our relatives, and our friends, or people who belong to the
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.520]   same social circle, the same class, or the same group, or the same country.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.220]   We are biased, we are prejudiced.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.600]   And because we are like that, we tend to think that God is the same.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.400]   And that's the whole point with which the apostle is dealing here.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:06.120]   And so he lays it down as an absolute and a fundamental postulate.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.720]   There's nothing like that about God.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:18.760]   There is no respect of persons whatsoever where God is the judge.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.920]   Now that's something which we must never lose sight of.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.680]   God is always just.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.640]   His judgment, as we saw in the second verse, is always according to truth.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.240]   And one of the ways in which we see the working out of God's judgment according to truth
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:43.500]   is that he is never prejudiced, he is never influenced by these kinds of considerations
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:51.960]   that weigh so much with us in our assessments and in our judgments.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.800]   Now we can add nothing really to the statement.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   It's just a sheer statement of fact.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:06.280]   But watch it in its application as the apostle elaborates it in the twelfth verse.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.200]   "For," he says, connecting it up, you see, "for as many as have sinned without
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.680]   law shall also perish without law.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:25.960]   And as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law."
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.040]   Now there he makes a universal statement.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.680]   Mankind was classified into two sections, into two groups.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:40.120]   You are either under the law or you are else not under the law.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.200]   There's a famous statement about that in 1 Corinthians chapter 9, where the apostle
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.080]   shows how it comes into his evangelizing.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.800]   When he speaks to those who are under the law, he says, "I speak as one under the
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   law.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.240]   When I speak to a man who is not under the law, I don't address him as if he were under
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   the law.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.880]   I address him as one who is not under the law."
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.280]   In other words, the world was divided into Jews and Gentiles.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.860]   The law had been given to the Jews, it had not been given to the Gentiles.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:18.180]   So the apostle takes that up here and he just makes these plain and direct statements.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:29.360]   The Gentiles, who had not been given the written law of Moses, as the Jews had been given it
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:40.680]   in that written form through Moses, the Gentiles shall not be judged according to that written
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   law.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.320]   They shall be judged as they are.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:53.100]   Now this is very important and it shows us God's fairness and his impartial dealings.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:14:00.960]   If a man is a Gentile and has sinned without the law, without the possession and the understanding
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:08.160]   of the written law as given through Moses, well, he will be judged and he will be punished
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.440]   as one who had not had the benefit of the written law.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:20.300]   That is the statement with regard to the Gentiles.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:29.840]   Now we can add to this, and we can say this, that a man who has never heard the gospel,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.480]   never had an opportunity of hearing it and has never heard it, will not be judged as
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.680]   if he had heard it.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.880]   Observe what I am saying.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.400]   I am saying no more about him.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.560]   I am not saying that he is saved by that fact.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.320]   I am saying that if he has never had an opportunity of hearing it, he will not be judged as if
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.880]   he had heard it.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.440]   I am saying no more.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.560]   But I am entitled to say that.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:15:00.520]   The principle is that a man is judged according to the situation in which he is.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.920]   If he is outside the written law, he will be judged as one who is outside the written
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   law.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:15.000]   Abraham, as many as have sinned in the law or under the law, shall be judged by the law.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.680]   Now the Jews had had the written law through Moses.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.960]   It was a great advantage, it was a great blessing.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.800]   The apostle is going to take that up in the next chapter when he asks, "What advantage
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.520]   then hath the Jew, or what profit is there in circumcision?"
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.120]   And he answers, "Much every way, chiefly because that unto them were committed the
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.360]   oracles of God."
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.200]   Very well, here is the Jew.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:48.400]   He has received the written law, this explicit statement of God's law, and he is going to
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:55.720]   be judged according to that knowledge, according to that advantage, according to that position
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.280]   in which he finds himself.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:05.120]   Now there is the simple statement of verse 12, which elaborates the principle laid down
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.360]   in verse 11.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.920]   What then is the teaching?
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.760]   What is the argument?
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:18.440]   Well, once more, there is nothing more vital than that we should indicate this.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:25.640]   This has nothing whatsoever to do with justification or salvation.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:32.540]   We must keep on repeating that, because the havoc that men have made of this particular
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:38.340]   passage, this particular statement, has always been due to the fact that instead of observing
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:44.760]   what it says and its context, they have just taken it right out and have tried to say that
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:51.600]   here we are being taught that a man can be saved and justified by his own actions.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.360]   But the apostle does not begin to deal with it, he does not even mention it, it is not
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.720]   in his mind at all.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.600]   What he is still concerned about is judgment.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.000]   As many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without law, and as many as have
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.360]   sinned in the law shall also be judged by the law.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:19.440]   He is not considering anything except this whole question of judgment.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:28.480]   And of course what he is saying therefore is this, what matters in the judgment is not
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:36.440]   our possession of the law or our lack of possession of the law, but sin.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.320]   You see, there he meets the whole position of the Jew.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.320]   The Jew's tendency was to say, "Ah, well, after all, we are the people who have got
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.360]   the law, and because God gave us the law, we are all right, we are not under judgment,
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.960]   we have got nothing to fear, and we needn't believe in this doctrine concerning the Jesus
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.640]   of Nazareth."
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.960]   They really believed, and that is the thing the apostle has to argue so much in detail.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:07.520]   They believed that the mere fact that they had the law given to them somehow or another
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.680]   saved them.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:15.320]   And what the apostle is saying therefore in these two verses is this, look here, judgment
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.400]   is not in terms of whether you happen to be along to a nation that has the law or to a
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.760]   nation that hasn't the law, the one thing that matters in judgment is sin, sin.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:33.680]   That is the thing, you see, that is common to the both, for as many as have sinned without
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.440]   the law and as many as have sinned in the law.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.680]   Once you come to this question of judgment, nothing matters but that, and that is where
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.160]   God's impartiality comes in.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.080]   The Jews are not favorites because God had given them the law, no, no, in the judgment,
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:00.200]   the one question asked is the one standard, what about sin?
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.960]   What of your life, what have you done?
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:09.720]   The judgment is concerned and interested only in this question of sin.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.760]   And it doesn't matter who you are if you have sinned, it doesn't make any difference
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.840]   whether you're a Jew or a Gentile, it doesn't matter whether you're a member of a church
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.400]   or have never been a member of the church, it doesn't matter whether you come from the
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.840]   most saintly family in Great Britain or the worst family in Great Britain, if you have
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.000]   sinned, you've sinned, and you'll be judged according to your sin, that's what he's saying.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And therefore it's no use turning to God and saying, ah, but you're forgetting who I am,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.040]   you're forgetting the profession I once made, you're forgetting the church that I belong
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.640]   to, you're forgetting the family, you're forgetting the nation, it's irrelevant.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.880]   There is no respect of persons with God.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.880]   And whether you are one who has the law or one who hasn't the law, it makes not the slightest
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.360]   difference.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:05.840]   Judgment is according, as he said in the previous section, to works, and here he especially
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:12.160]   emphasizes the aspect of the sinful character of the works.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.840]   Now then, that is his main argument.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:24.000]   But we must also observe the terms that he uses.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.240]   You notice how the Apostle keeps us to this?
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.280]   He won't let us get away from it.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.400]   I admit, my dear friends, that if I had my own choice, I wouldn't stay with it like this.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.760]   But here it is, he goes on repeating these things.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.960]   I'm talking about the word "perish" in verse 12.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:52.920]   For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.600]   That is always the punishment of sin.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.400]   You'll find it everywhere in your Bible.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:07.760]   I know the modern man doesn't like it, and therefore he takes it out of his Bible.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.360]   But what has he got left when he has taken it out?
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.960]   Take out all the verses that mention it, and where are you?
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.160]   What have you found?
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160]   What have you left?
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:24.180]   Now, there's nothing in the Bible about ignorance or any special pleading or any attempt to
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.200]   mitigate the sentence or to reduce its severity.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.840]   There's not a word about it.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.220]   This is the categorical statement that is made about the Gentiles.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:38.920]   As many as have sinned without law shall perish without law.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.600]   Perish.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.680]   And perish means perish.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.460]   It doesn't mean go out of existence.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:54.120]   It's the opposite, you notice, to eternal life, always.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.560]   It's the same as everlasting destruction.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:05.240]   It's the same as that place where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.360]   Perishing.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:14.640]   It's the condition, the state of those who are outside the life of God.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.560]   Very well, there it is, and you ignore it at your peril.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:27.080]   Now, I wonder whether you've observed an extraordinary change of word which takes place
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.480]   in this twelfth verse.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.360]   For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:43.280]   And as many as have sinned in the law shall perish by the law.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.240]   No, shall be judged by the law.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.640]   Instead of having the parallel perish, he has here judge rather than perish.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.280]   Now, why do you think this difference?
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.760]   Why did the apostle there deliberately change his word?
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:11.200]   Why did he say that the Jew, the man who is under the law and who sins, shall be judged
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   by the law?
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.360]   And why doesn't he say that the other man is judged, but just say that he perishes?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:24.440]   Now, here, surely, is a very interesting and a very important point.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:30.160]   And it seems to me that there is only one really adequate explanation of it.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:41.680]   And it is this, that the standard that God applies to the Jew is a higher and a severer
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.480]   standard than he applies to the Gentile.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:54.400]   Now, that doesn't make any difference in the final, ultimate destiny.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:04.240]   But it does seem to indicate, it seems to me, that there is a difference in the punishment.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.200]   God demands more of the Jew than he demands of the Gentile.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   Why?
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.600]   Well, because he had given him the law.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:21.320]   Now, as we work out the parentheses, we shall see that the apostle says that the difference,
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:26.660]   in a sense, between the Gentile and the Jew was this, that the Gentile had a kind of fundamental
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:36.120]   law in his mind and in his heart, but he had never received it in an explicit, external,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.280]   and objective manner.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.000]   But the Jew, on the other hand, had received it in that way.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.720]   God had given it through Moses, and therefore the Jew was in a very advantageous position.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.400]   Sin had been defined for the Jew.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.720]   It had been codified.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.080]   It had been made perfectly plain and clear.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.000]   There was therefore no excuse for him.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.200]   Now, in the case of the Gentile, that had not been done.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.480]   He does have a knowledge of the law, as I shall work out with you, but he hasn't it
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.760]   in the same form as the Jew has it.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.120]   And therefore, because the Jew has been in a more advantageous position, because he's
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:22.560]   had teaching and training and instruction and this great help of the external law, the
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:30.380]   standard applied to him will be a higher standard than that in the case of the Gentile.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:36.880]   So that the Jew, you see, far from being saved by the fact that he had the law, is really
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.920]   in this position, that his responsibility is altogether greater.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:48.440]   And far from escaping judgment altogether, because he is a Jew, the judgment in his case
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.680]   is going to be severer than in the case of the Gentile.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.120]   Now then, take the exposition of that which I read to you at the beginning, which was
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.840]   given there in the twelfth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, in the words
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.520]   of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   You remember that he draws that very distinction between the two classes of servants about
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.760]   which he is speaking.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:20.480]   He says, "And that servant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.800]   did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes; but he that knew not, and
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:40.240]   For unto whomsoever much is given of him, shall be much required; and to whom men have
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:46.040]   committed much of him, they will ask them more."
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:50.600]   Now there, it seems to me, is the perfect commentary upon what the Apostle is saying
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   here.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.760]   Or, if you like it the other way around, the Apostle Paul is just repeating what his blessed
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.600]   Lord and Master had said before him.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.640]   Now let's be perfectly clear about this.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:12.640]   The sinful Gentile and Jew will go together to perdition.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.840]   But there seems to be perfectly clear teaching that the punishment and the suffering of the
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:25.040]   Jew for his sins will be greater than that of the Gentile.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.700]   And it's perfectly just, it's perfectly equitable.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.840]   He has had the advantage, the greater opportunity, the greater light.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.280]   And therefore, he is judged according to the light which he had.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:44.720]   Now I say that this is very important, not only to an understanding of this particular
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:53.360]   statement here, but my good friends, it applies to us.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:59.080]   You will find that in the second epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 5, there is a reference
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.240]   to the judgment of believers.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.760]   And you will find that there is a judgment of rewards, as it were.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.800]   That's the other side, it seems to me, of this very doctrine.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:21.440]   It's a very difficult subject, a very difficult doctrine, but it's perfectly clear that it's
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   there.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   In 1 Corinthians 3 and in 2 Corinthians 5, read it and study it at your leisure.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:36.240]   The man who's going to be saved, if he's built in a wrong way on the foundation, he himself
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   shall be saved.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:45.680]   He's going to suffer loss, yet he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:50.120]   But the man who's built well, he's going to have a greater reward.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.720]   And we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that we may receive according
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:02.020]   to the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:09.160]   Therefore I say that every time you and I hear the gospel, our responsibility is increased.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:16.120]   The more we have heard the gospel, the clearer our understanding of it, the greater is our
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   responsibility.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.840]   The more we've grown in grace and advanced in the knowledge of the Lord, again, the greater
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.480]   is our responsibility.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:33.080]   And the principle that is being laid down is that God in his judgment is going to take
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.680]   all these things into full account.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:42.800]   It's perfectly fair, I say, it is absolutely just and right.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:51.600]   But surely this ought to affect us all profoundly, and it ought to enable us to see more clearly
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:58.560]   than we've ever seen before, that there is nothing more dangerous to the soul than just
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:05.480]   to be shouting, "Lord, Lord," or to be making use of the doctrine of justification by faith
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.080]   as if it put everything right once and forever.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:17.280]   It does in the matter of salvation or being lost, but it most certainly goes no further.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.040]   We are preparing for our eternity.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   You read in the fourteenth chapter of the book of the Revelation of John, at the end
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:32.800]   of the Bible, a statement like this about the blessed dead, "And their works do follow
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:40.680]   them," blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth, "and their works do
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.960]   follow them."
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.960]   And they will.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.000]   Our works are going to follow us.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.480]   They're not going to determine our salvation, but they're going to make a difference to
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   us.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:58.000]   It's going to be a question of suffering loss or not, it's going to be a question of a greater
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.640]   reward or not.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.840]   Well, there it is.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:07.640]   I don't pretend to be able to understand it more deeply than that, but it's here laid
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:13.560]   down as a great principle in God's judgment.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:20.080]   And therefore I say we ought to pay attention to it and to give it most serious thought
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.300]   and meditation.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:29.120]   We cannot leave this particular point without again emphasizing the finality that is expressed
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.480]   in these words, "perish" and "judgment."
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.760]   Very well, then.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:43.000]   That enables us just to look at the statement in verse sixteen, so that we get our general
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.800]   statement complete before we even begin to look at the parenthesis.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.920]   What do we find in this verse?
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:57.760]   Well, again we notice there's emphasis upon this day of judgment.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.920]   This day when God shall judge the secrets of all men.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.320]   I needn't go back over that.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.480]   We've already come across that idea.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.800]   That day that the apostle has already been telling us about in the fifth verse, "But
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:24.360]   after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath."
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.680]   And the revelation of the righteous judgment of God.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.520]   The day will declare it, says the apostle to the Corinthians.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.420]   The day of judgment.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.880]   Very well, but let's note this next thing he says.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:48.840]   He says that the judgment is going to be exercised by Jesus Christ in the day when God shall
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:54.760]   judge the secrets of men, by Jesus Christ.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:00.880]   Now here again is a matter of great importance and of great interest.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:07.160]   The Lord Jesus Christ is not only the Savior, he is going to be the judge.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.760]   You remember he himself puts this very plainly in the fifth chapter of the gospel according
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.700]   to St. John.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.520]   Let me read to you the relevant verses.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:27.440]   First of all in verse 22, John 5, 22, "For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.640]   all judgment unto the Son."
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:39.920]   And again go on to verse 26, "For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:47.440]   the Son to have life in himself, and hath given him authority to execute judgment also,
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.880]   because he is the Son of man.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.680]   Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:03.440]   hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the resurrection
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:09.720]   of life, and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.280]   You see, it's exactly what Paul is saying here.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:20.080]   He is the judge, and he is going to appoint the final destiny to the two groups.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:26.120]   It's going to be one or the other, the resurrection of life, or else the resurrection of damnation.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.800]   And do you notice in what terms?
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.100]   They that have done good, they that have done evil.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:36.160]   But he is the judge.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:42.840]   The apostle Paul, in preaching at Athens, you'll find the record in Acts 17.31, says
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.980]   the same thing.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.520]   He says, "God commendeth all men now everywhere to repent."
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   Why?
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:56.000]   "Well, because he hath appointed a day in the which he shall judge the world in righteousness
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.960]   by that man whom he hath appointed, whereof he hath given assurance in that he hath raised
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.040]   him from the dead."
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:11.680]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ, in addition to all the other things that he does and proclaims,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.960]   proclaims this, that he is to be the judge of the world.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:25.240]   There, the assurance, the announcement has been made.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.120]   May we speculate as to why this has been done?
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.720]   Well, our Lord himself gives us the hint.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:38.600]   He says the judgment has been given to him because he is the son of man.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.720]   May I suggest this with reverence?
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   That it is given to him partly as a reward because he humbled himself and because he
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.960]   came down so low.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:57.160]   The apostle, this apostle suggests that in the second chapter of the epistle to the Philippians,
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:02.000]   where having described to us how he emptied himself and divested himself of his eternal
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.880]   glory and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, wherefore, he says,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.840]   because of that, God hath also highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   other name.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:21.920]   Yes, he is the judge as a reward for his humiliation.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.480]   But I think there is something further.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:31.820]   He is the judge because he is the son of man, because he is the head of this new race of
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.600]   humanity.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:42.120]   He is the judge because God, as it were, has handed over the affairs of men to him.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.360]   And he became man in order that he might do so.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:51.880]   Which leads me to my last point, which is this, that he is the judge in order that no
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:59.960]   one might ever be able to say that the judgment isn't absolutely fair.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.200]   We like to think of him, don't we, as our great high priest because he's touched with
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.960]   the feeling of our infirmities, because he was the son of man, because he took unto him
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.960]   human nature.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.880]   Very well, that's perfectly right.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.680]   But this is also right.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.160]   He has been here as a man and he's lived as a man.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.480]   He's been under the law.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.420]   His judgment is fair.
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:25.440]   People might say they're always ready to attack the character of God.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.440]   They might say, "How can God judge us?
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   He's so far removed.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.400]   He's in heaven and he's not on earth.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.480]   He doesn't understand human nature and human conditions and life in this world."
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.200]   The judgment is in the hands of one who has been through it all.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.000]   He knows all about it.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.200]   Man as well as God who has lived in this world and has suffered under the law and under sin.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:56.600]   Very well, then, so that he is the judge in order that every mouth shall be stopped and
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.900]   God shall be all and in all.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:05.360]   The judgment is according to Jesus, is by Jesus Christ.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:11.660]   I must emphasize what he again emphasizes, which is this, that in that day the Lord Jesus
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:20.780]   Christ will judge us and judge the secrets of men.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.420]   Why does he say this, do you think?
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:28.820]   Well, for this reason, to remind us that we shall not only be judged according to our
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:39.140]   actions, we shall be judged according to everything that is true of us.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:44.260]   The Pharisee could make a very good show as regards external examination and actions.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:51.300]   "You are the people," said our Lord, "to them who clean the outside of the cup and
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:58.780]   the platter, but your inward parts are full of ravening and of wickedness."
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:03.180]   It's a very terrifying thought, this, but here it is.
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:12.060]   You and I will be judged not only by our deeds and actions, but, as the Lord himself said,
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:17.020]   by every idle word that we have ever spoken.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:26.300]   Not only that, by every thought, by every imagination, by everything that we have ever
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:35.580]   harbored or fostered or fundled in mind or heart or imagination.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:40.860]   That's the teaching of the Scripture, the secrets of men.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.300]   He's not saying that it is only according to our secrets we shall be judged.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:51.420]   What he's saying is that in addition to the external actions, our secrets, all things
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.860]   are naked and open unto the eye of him with whom we have to do.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.160]   He is a judge of the thoughts and intents of the hearts.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.220]   He can divide even to the separating of the joints and marrow and the soul and spirit.
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.740]   He knows everything.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:15.620]   It'll be no consolation to us in the judgment just to say, "Ah, I didn't actually commit
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   that sin."
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.940]   The question is, did you play with it in your mind?
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.980]   Did you spend a lot of your time in doing so?
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:30.340]   I've put it, I think, like this before, let me repeat it.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:39.220]   How much time do you spend in reading the unsavory details and the filth of the proceedings
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:44.140]   in the law courts and other courts?
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.740]   If you enjoy it and if you read it because you like it, you'll have to give an account
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:48.740]   of that.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.580]   That's a part of the secrets.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.020]   It's all known to God.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.020]   He knows exactly what we do with our time.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.420]   He knows exactly how we spend it.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:05.460]   Everything we do is known, it's recorded, and we shall be judged according to all that,
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:09.740]   the secrets of men.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:17.920]   What an exposure it'll be, how terrified we all are of being found out.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.060]   As long as it isn't known, we say, as long as the public doesn't, as long as it isn't
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.060]   in the press.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:29.300]   How terrified we are of exposure if people only knew what happens within us.
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:38.100]   Well, God does know, and it's all recorded, and it'll all come into this question of judgment,
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.940]   the secrets of men.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.420]   And then I must say just a word about this other most interesting phrase.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.280]   Let me read the whole verse again.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:58.420]   In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel?
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:04.780]   But wait a minute, you say, Paul, you must have forgotten, you must have been tired when
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.120]   you reached that point.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.180]   This isn't a part of your gospel?
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:18.020]   Judgment, perishing, secrets exposed, sentenced, promulgated, is that gospel?
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:28.300]   According to the apostle Paul, it is a part of the gospel, an essential part of the gospel.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:32.660]   According to my gospel, says Paul, according to the good news which has been committed
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:37.540]   unto me, and you remember how he describes it in the first chapter, he's a called apostle,
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:41.860]   all this has been committed to him, he's going about preaching it, and this is a part of
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:51.380]   the preaching, the judgment of God upon the secrets of all men.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:58.200]   The gospel, you know, is not just simply come to Christ and have all your problems solved
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:04.700]   and walk with a new and a lighter step tomorrow, and now I am happy all the day.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:11.940]   My dear friends, that isn't all the gospel, it is the gospel, but this is a part of the
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.700]   gospel, the judgment.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:21.580]   Indeed, we've seen already that the moment the apostle announces the theme of the gospel
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:26.940]   in verses 16 and 17 of the first chapter, he at once goes on to say, "For the wrath
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:37.840]   of God is revealed, and unless you and I preach this wrath of God and day of judgment, we
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.680]   are not preaching a full gospel.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.300]   We are holding back something in order to perhaps to ingratiate ourselves with men."
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.540]   Of course, the argument is this, we're all familiar with it, they say, you know, the
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.340]   modern man doesn't like that sort of preaching, and if you talk about the wrath of God, he
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.340]   won't come, therefore you leave it out.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:01.320]   In other words, in order to be worldly wise, and in order to use your knowledge of psychology,
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.700]   you leave out the part of God's gospel.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:14.140]   What a terrible thing it is, how clever we think we are, but how we deny the word that
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:24.860]   we claim to believe, and how perhaps do we stand between souls and eternal salvation.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:32.540]   For if a man doesn't realize that the wrath of God was upon him, and that nothing but
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:39.420]   the death of the Lord Jesus Christ on that cross saved him, not from his particular sin,
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:45.860]   but from the wrath of God, he really hasn't the gospel.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:51.860]   This is the essence of the gospel, read through your New Testament, you'll find it everywhere.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:59.780]   "According to my gospel," says Paul, when the modern man would have least expected him
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.380]   to have introduced the very term "gospel."
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.420]   I must say one word about this little word, "my."
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.180]   "According to my gospel," says Paul.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:15.300]   You know, I wouldn't refer to this but for one thing.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:21.980]   I remember reading a sermon in a well-known religious weekly paper about twenty years
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:31.540]   ago, a sermon by a very popular preacher, and he preached on this phrase "my gospel."
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:36.820]   He was actually preaching on 2 Timothy 2.8, where the apostle uses the same expression
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:42.180]   again as he uses it in the sixteenth chapter of this epistle to the Romans, verse 25.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.620]   It's the three times he talks about "my gospel."
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:52.660]   But this is how this man preached on that expression, "my gospel."
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:59.540]   Now he said, "The great thing for all of us to know is this.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.820]   Can I say 'my gospel'?"
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:09.140]   He said, "You know, there are far too many people who are living on somebody else's gospel,
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:15.260]   on their father's gospel, their mother's gospel, husband's gospel, wife's gospel,
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:20.700]   forebear's gospel, the gospel of the church to which they belong."
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.980]   He said, "You know, they haven't really got assurance.
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.660]   They're not able to say 'my gospel.'"
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:30.460]   All right, so far he's all right.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:37.820]   But he went further and he said this, "Of course," he said, "your gospel may not be
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.180]   the same as my gospel, but that doesn't matter," he said.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:48.380]   "The great thing is that you can say 'my gospel,' that you really have got an experience.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:52.940]   You may see it in this way, I may see it in that way, the other men may see it in quite
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.860]   a different way, but," he said, "that doesn't matter at all.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:01.900]   The great thing is that you can say that the Lord Jesus Christ has really made you happy."
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:08.860]   Of course, we may disagree tremendously theologically and so on.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:15.340]   One might want to insist upon the penal element in the atonement and so on, and another doesn't,
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.020]   but what's it matter?
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:23.060]   The great thing is that you've got an experience, you can say, "my gospel."
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.900]   What an utter travesty.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:30.100]   That isn't what this apostle means.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:36.460]   It isn't what he means in 2 Timothy 2.8 to start with, where he says, "Remember that
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:43.900]   Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel."
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:49.420]   He goes out of his way everywhere to say that there is only one gospel, and so he says to
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:55.340]   the Galatians, "If we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:48:00.180]   which we have preached, let him be accursed," Galatians 1.8.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.380]   There is no other gospel.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.380]   What does he mean by "my gospel," then?
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:11.740]   Well, he means the gospel which had been committed to him, which he'd been privileged to preach,
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.900]   the same gospel as was preached by all the other apostles.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.420]   But he likes to call it his gospel as well.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   It was his gospel.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:25.060]   He'd felt it, he'd experienced it, he was preaching it in all its fullness as the other
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.140]   apostles were.
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:35.420]   I say I wouldn't have referred to that were it not that I was aware thus of the subtle
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:43.860]   way in which the devil can twist even a little word like the word "my" and make it mean the
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:47.620]   exact opposite of what it's meant to mean.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:55.780]   No, no, what matters is not your experience and mine primarily, but this, the truth, the
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:04.080]   word of God, the gospel once and forever delivered and committed to the saints.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:13.060]   There is only one, and it's only your gospel and my gospel as we continue steadfastly in
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:21.540]   the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayer.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.580]   Other foundation can no man lay.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:28.300]   This is the only gospel.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:35.220]   God grant that we all know it as our gospel also.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.220]   Amen.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:41.100]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
