[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.760]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.960]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.440]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.320]   Today, we are discussing how to study and learn.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.800]   That is, what the scientific data say
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.560]   is the best way to study in order to remember information
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.320]   and to be able to use that information effectively
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.160]   in different areas of your life.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.360]   So for those of you that are still in school,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.800]   this could be any stage of school,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.120]   today's discussion will be very useful for you.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.280]   However, even if you are not formally enrolled
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.320]   in any kind of school at the moment,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.880]   today's discussion will also be extremely effective for you
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.160]   to be able to study and learn better information
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160]   from, say, the internet, or podcasts,
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.800]   or any area of your life where you are seeking
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.960]   to learn and use new knowledge.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.400]   Now, one of the most important things
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.820]   that you're going to learn today
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.520]   is that learning, that is, the best learning practices,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.480]   are not intuitive.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.880]   So before we dive in,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.680]   keep in mind that whatever you believe
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.680]   about how best to learn for you is probably incorrect.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.360]   And I confess this was humbling for me as well
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.640]   when I started to dive into this literature,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.040]   because as somebody who was a student for many years,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.600]   and in some sense still considers himself a student
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.560]   of science and health information because of this podcast,
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.540]   and certainly as somebody who still teaches
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.680]   university courses, both to medical students
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.520]   and graduate students,
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.740]   and to undergraduate students at Stanford,
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.920]   I thought I understood the whole teaching
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.960]   and learning process,
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.520]   but I too learned that it is anything but intuitive.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.680]   In fact, most of what we believe
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.640]   about the best ways to study are absolutely false.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.000]   Fortunately, today you will learn the best ways to study.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.120]   Turns out there's a rich literature on this,
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.080]   dating back well over a hundred years,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.400]   and the data are absolutely fascinating
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.920]   and incredibly actionable.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.040]   It's incredibly interesting how the fields of education,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.880]   the fields of psychology, and the fields of neuroscience
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.560]   have now come together to define the optimal strategies
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.420]   to study and learn.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.320]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.980]   is separate from my teaching research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.100]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.720]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.440]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.720]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.580]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.760]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.400]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.920]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.480]   about the critical need to get sleep,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.920]   both enough sleep and enough quality sleep.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.200]   Now, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.320]   is that your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.860]   by about one to three degrees
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.600]   in order for you to fall and stay deeply asleep.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.400]   And to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.660]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.360]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.700]   One of the best ways to ensure all of that happens
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.120]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.640]   And with Eight Sleep, it's very easy to do that.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.160]   You program the temperature that you want
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.400]   at the beginning, middle, and the end of the night,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.440]   and that's the temperature that you're going to sleep at.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.880]   And it will track your sleep.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.780]   It tells you how much slow wave sleep you're getting,
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.620]   how much rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.760]   which is critical, and all of that also helps you
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.920]   dial in the exact parameters you need
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.420]   in order to get the best possible night's sleep for you.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.200]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.620]   for well over three years now,
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.920]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.080]   Eight Sleep recently launched
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.520]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.560]   The Pod 4 Ultra cover has improved cooling
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.840]   and heating capacity,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.560]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.200]   and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.540]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.640]   to improve airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.400]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.560]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.020]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.600]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.840]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.960]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.600]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.360]   I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.800]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.300]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.000]   but pretty soon I realized that therapy
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.800]   is an extremely important component to overall health.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.960]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.520]   just as important as getting regular exercise.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.920]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.280]   that great therapy provides.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.640]   First of all, it provides good rapport
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.540]   with somebody that you can trust and talk to
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.040]   about the issues that are most critical to you.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.080]   Second of all, it can provide support
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.960]   in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.480]   And third, expert therapy should provide insights.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.000]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.620]   for you to find an expert therapist
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.480]   with whom you have these critical components of therapy.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.620]   Also, because BetterHelp allows for therapy
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.840]   to be done entirely online, it's very time efficient
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.920]   and easy to fit into your busy schedule
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.760]   with no commuting to a therapist's office
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.800]   or looking for parking or sitting in a waiting room.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.200]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.960]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.880]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.240]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.980]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.440]   that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.840]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.280]   I started practicing meditation
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.120]   when I was about 15 years old,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.760]   and it made a profound impact on my life.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.120]   And by now, there are thousands
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.700]   of quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.960]   that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.680]   for improving our focus, managing stress and anxiety,
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.980]   improving our mood, and much more.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.280]   In recent years, I started using the Waking Up app
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.000]   for my meditations because I find it
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.040]   to be a terrific resource for allowing me
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.000]   to really be consistent with my meditation practice.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.120]   Many people start a meditation practice
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.400]   and experience some benefits,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.600]   but many people also have challenges keeping up
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.800]   with that practice.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.320]   What I and so many other people love
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.400]   about the Waking Up app is that it has a lot
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.160]   of different meditations to choose from,
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.720]   and those meditations are of different durations.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.280]   So it makes it very easy to keep up
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.800]   with your meditation practice,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.720]   both from the perspective of novelty,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.400]   you never get tired of those meditations,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.960]   there's always something new to explore
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.200]   and to learn about yourself
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.640]   and about the effectiveness of meditation,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.320]   and you can always fit meditation into your schedule,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.120]   even if you only have two or three minutes per day
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.220]   in which to meditate.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.880]   I also really like doing yoga nidra
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.260]   or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.840]   for about 10 or 20 minutes,
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.080]   because it is a great way to restore mental
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.280]   and physical vigor without the tiredness
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.700]   that some people experience when they wake up
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.000]   from a conventional nap.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.540]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.380]   please go to wakingup.com/huberman,
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.480]   where you can access a free 30-day trial.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.360]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman

[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.720]   Okay, let's talk about how best to study and learn.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.480]   And of course, people have different learning styles.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.880]   Some people prefer to learn by reading.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.580]   Some people prefer to study in a group.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.400]   Some people prefer to highlight.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.000]   Some people call themselves auditory learners.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.160]   Other people consider themselves visual learners.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.420]   But guess what?
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.120]   When one looks at the research on preferred learning styles,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.280]   pretty much all of that melts away.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.400]   It turns out that the best way to study and learn
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.720]   is defined not by the medium in which that material arrives,
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.660]   whether or not it's auditory or visual or combined,
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.020]   whether or not you review slides or a textbook,
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.500]   or you watch small videos.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.780]   It turns out that the best way to study and learn
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.840]   is to access components of your memory systems
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.440]   that offset forgetting.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.960]   This is a theme I'm going to return to over and over again
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.540]   throughout today's episode.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.520]   Rather than think about studying
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.080]   to learn and retain information,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.860]   I want you to think about studying
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.160]   to offset the natural process of forgetting
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.040]   that everybody experiences
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.880]   when they are exposed to new material of any kind,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.280]   cognitive or motor learning,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.600]   musical learning, math, et cetera.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.320]   Okay, so keep this in mind throughout today's episode.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.000]   The best way to learn
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.520]   is to think about offsetting
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.800]   the natural forgetting of new information.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.000]   You're trying to inoculate against forgetting.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.640]   That is the way to remember things.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.240]   That is the way to gain mastery over them.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.400]   And I'm going to teach you how to best do that
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.320]   using the data gleaned from the peer-reviewed literature.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.240]   Now, before I do that,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.480]   I want to talk about what learning is.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.380]   I promise to make this fairly brief
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.640]   because I've covered learning
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.240]   and so-called neuroplasticity before on this podcast.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.960]   For those of you that have heard those discussions,
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.600]   this will serve as a refresher.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.040]   For those of you that have not heard those discussions,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.160]   this will be thorough enough
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.440]   for you to be able to digest
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.320]   all the rest of today's information.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.760]   Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.640]   of your nervous system,
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.400]   which of course includes your brain and your spinal cord,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.160]   which is the ability for your nervous system
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.560]   to change in response to experience.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.480]   So any form of learning involves neuroplasticity.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.800]   Neuroplasticity, we sometimes hear as neuroplasticity,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.400]   two words, or neuroplasticity.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   Those are the same thing, essentially.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.700]   The change that underlies neuroplasticity
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.080]   at the level of cells,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.340]   which we call neurons or nerve cells,
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.460]   generally involves three different mechanisms.
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.240]   One is the strengthening of certain connections,
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.680]   what we call synaptic connections.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.020]   Synapses are the location between neurons
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.740]   where they communicate with one another.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.420]   It's actually a gap between the neurons.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.760]   It is technically called the synaptic cleft.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.600]   It's a gap.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.100]   And within that gap,
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.880]   chemicals are passed across that gap
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.920]   that allow one neuron to activate other neurons,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.480]   or many neurons to activate many other neurons,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.700]   or to inhibit the activity of other neurons, okay?
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.840]   So one form of neuroplasticity
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.960]   is the strengthening of connections between neurons.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.740]   Another form of neuroplasticity
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.980]   is the weakening of connections between neurons.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.040]   And yet a third form of plasticity,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.440]   which is often discussed in the media,
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.120]   but is very rare actually in the nervous system,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   especially the adult nervous system of humans,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.880]   is neurogenesis, or the addition of new neurons.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.840]   Let's just get this out of the way upfront
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.320]   because the addition of new neurons, again,
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.360]   grabs so much attention in media articles,
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   but it's responsible for a near trivial amount
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.780]   of the sort of neuroplasticity
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.480]   that is important for today's discussion,
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.520]   or frankly, for most all discussions.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.180]   It is true you have a specialized set of neurons
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.800]   in your olfactory bulb that are responsible for smell,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.440]   as well as a specialized set of neurons
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.880]   in the so-called dentate gyrus of your hippocampus,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.480]   an area of the brain that's important for memory,
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.040]   in which new neurons appear to be added
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.160]   throughout the lifespan.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.020]   But this is not the major mechanism
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.720]   by which learning and memory occurs in humans.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.460]   Rather, the major mechanism
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.480]   by which learning and memory occurs in humans
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.200]   is the strengthening of existing connections
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.240]   and the weakening of existing connections,
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.060]   or the formation of new connections
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.060]   between already existing neurons, not new neurons, okay?
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.920]   Now, the removal or weakening of connections
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.400]   between neurons being an important component
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   of neuroplasticity is very important
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.120]   for sake of today's discussion.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.760]   I want to emphasize that when we hear
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.220]   about weakening of connections,
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.880]   we often think, well, that means forgetting,
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.980]   or that means the brain is getting less good.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.520]   However, so much of the neuroplasticity that underlies,
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.100]   for instance, the acquisition of a new motor skill
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.780]   is actually the reflection of removal of connections.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.240]   So we don't want to project any kind of value
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.760]   onto a discussion about adding new connections,
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.080]   removing new connections.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.320]   Let's just leave it at this level mechanistically.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.040]   When you hear about neuroplasticity,
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.800]   just know that it could be the consequence
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.040]   of strengthening of connections,
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.080]   as well as weakening of connections.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.200]   And that neither strengthening of connections
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.560]   in the nervous system, nor weakening of connections
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.800]   can map directly to the formation or removal
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.660]   of say, memories or information.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.900]   Just know that these are the important mechanisms.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.220]   In fact, if you look at a baby that is, let's say,
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.660]   I don't know, nine months old,
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.320]   their motor skills are not terrific, typically,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.680]   compared to the motor skills that that child will have
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.540]   when they are six or seven years old.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.140]   Just look at a kid trying to eat spaghetti
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.180]   or something of that sort,
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.300]   or eat anything when they're a small baby
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.760]   versus a toddler versus a young child
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.380]   versus an adolescent or teen.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.600]   Despite the poor table manners of some adolescents
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.100]   and teens and some adults, for that matter,
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.300]   they are still exhibiting far more precise motor movements
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.040]   than they did as an infant, of course.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.620]   And believe it or not, the improvement in motor coordination
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.760]   that one observes in humans and other species,
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.400]   for that matter, from birth until the adolescence
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.640]   and teen years and adult years
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.780]   is largely the reflection of the removal.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.420]   That's right, the removal of neural connections
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.620]   as opposed to the formation of neural connections.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.220]   However, the neural connections that remain
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.480]   become much more robust.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.320]   They become much more reliable, okay?
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.000]   So that's the mechanistic backdrop
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.260]   for everything that we're gonna talk about today,
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.600]   which is how to study and learn.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.860]   And as I mentioned earlier in my introduction,
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.060]   most of learning and remembering new material
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.480]   is about offsetting the forgetting process
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.160]   that naturally occurs any time we hear new information.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.040]   So in keeping with what will ultimately reveal itself
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.540]   to be the dominant theme of today's discussion right now,
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.000]   and for reasons that will become clear later,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.080]   I want you to take a brief quiz.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.720]   Now, the moment people hear quiz or test,
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.820]   typically it spikes their adrenaline,
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.280]   they start feeling stressed, but don't worry,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.920]   you're gonna keep your answers to yourself
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.340]   and you're doing this for a very specific purpose.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.800]   Here's my question.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.060]   This is a two question quiz.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:58.140]   How many different ways, mechanistically speaking,
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.840]   does neuroplasticity occur?
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.800]   Is it one mechanism, two mechanisms, or three mechanisms?
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.200]   Or is it four or five?
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.440]   Okay, can you name in your head
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.300]   two of the three major changes
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.600]   that the nervous system can undergo
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   which are reflective of neuroplasticity?
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.620]   Okay, so the answer to question was,
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.860]   is that there are three different modes of neuroplasticity
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.580]   as you recall, or as you may not have been able to recall.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.020]   And by the way, if you were not able to recall
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.100]   the three different modes of neuroplasticity
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.460]   or mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity, that is fine.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.020]   As you'll soon realize, recognizing the errors
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.840]   in your information retention is another critical
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.800]   and very useful way to retain more information,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.100]   even if you got the answer wrong or you didn't know.
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.740]   In fact, especially if you got the answer wrong
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.300]   or you didn't know.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.380]   So the three ways are the strengthening
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.420]   of neural connections,
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.320]   second, the weakening of neural connections,
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.940]   and third, through neurogenesis, the addition of new neurons.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.540]   Why did I provide this quiz?
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.500]   Why did I test you?
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.580]   Well, as you'll soon learn,
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.380]   if you look across the total body of research
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.500]   on how best to study and learn,
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.960]   it involves doing exactly what we just did,
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.140]   which is to periodically stop and test yourself
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.400]   on the material that you learned.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.260]   Testing is not just a way of evaluating
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.740]   what knowledge you've acquired
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.100]   and which knowledge you have not managed to acquire.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.140]   It also turns out to be the best tool
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.460]   for offsetting forgetting of any kind.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.980]   And I'll go into the data that supports that statement
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.900]   in a moment.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.700]   So yes, today we're going to get a little bit meta
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.000]   in the sense that we're going to be learning
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.700]   about optimal studying strategies and applying those
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.800]   as we go through this podcast.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.280]   And no, there will not be a test at the end,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.480]   although you're welcome to give yourself a test at the end.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.720]   I'm going to provide you with an excellent zero cost,
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.000]   very fast tool that you can use to evaluate your knowledge
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.320]   and your ability to study and learn better
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.520]   as a consequence of having listened to this podcast
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.720]   versus had you not listened to this podcast.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.720]   So if ever there was an incentive to listen to the end,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.540]   there it is.
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.720]   Okay, let's talk about some of the other practical aspects
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.000]   of studying and learning.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.360]   I know a lot of you out there who want to learn
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.340]   and want to come up with the best studying strategies
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.480]   are trying to think about how to structure your day
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.880]   or how much to study or when to study.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.720]   Let's get the most important things out of the way first.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.240]   Neuroplasticity and learning,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.440]   that is converting your studying efforts
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.520]   into retention of knowledge is a two-step process.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.940]   You probably heard about active engagement.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.900]   That's just a fancy set of words for focus,
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.980]   for really attending to the information
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.120]   that you're trying to learn.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.280]   And it is very important
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.640]   anytime you're trying to learn new information.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.180]   So focus goes with alertness.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.440]   You can't be focused if you're not alert.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.060]   This is prerequisite.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.040]   So you need to be alert and you need to be focused
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.560]   in order to pay attention to the information
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.840]   that you're trying to learn.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.520]   In fact, it is the process of being focused and attending
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.400]   that cues your nervous system that something is important,
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   that something's different
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.960]   about whatever sensory experience you happen to be having
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.940]   when you're focused and attending,
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.640]   whether or not it's the information you're hearing
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.360]   or that you're looking at or both.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.740]   That cue at the level of neurochemicals
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.600]   in your brain and body signals to the neurons,
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.580]   hey, you're going to have to change.
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.540]   You're going to have to alter your connections,
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.380]   either make them stronger or weaker
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.240]   or a combination of those things
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.780]   in order to make sure that your nervous system
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.520]   can retain and use the information at a future time.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.540]   So that's step one.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.720]   And of course, as a part of step one,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.320]   most people, when they hear
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.840]   about optimal studying strategies, they want to know,
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.680]   you know, what should they do?
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.160]   What should they take in order to learn better?
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.100]   Well, here's what everyone should take
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:52.960]   in order to learn better,
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.380]   which is a great night's sleep the night before,
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.840]   limiting your external stress.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.120]   Although some stress is good
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.760]   because it cues up your alertness.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.160]   It actually allows you to remember certain things better.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.400]   We'll talk about this a little bit later.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   No one can remove all stress from their life,
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.520]   but we know one thing for sure,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.620]   your ability to be alert and focused
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.840]   is going to be greater if you slept well the night before.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.460]   Okay, so sleep is without question the best nootropic.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.200]   Right, the word nootropic means smart drug.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.800]   I don't really like that term
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.740]   because learning involves all sorts of things.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.920]   It's not just about being smart.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.500]   It's about being able to attend.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.360]   It's about sometimes being creative,
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.760]   flexible with ideas and information.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.960]   Here's the point.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.600]   You're going to need to get your sleep right
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.480]   in order to be able to study and learn
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.120]   at your absolute best.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.380]   And I've done many episodes
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.920]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast about sleep.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.240]   We have a newsletter about sleep,
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.400]   the details in a short PDF format,
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.440]   the various things you can do
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.160]   to get your sleep optimized, so to speak.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.960]   You can find all that HubermanLab.com
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.400]   by putting sleep into the search function.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.860]   We don't have time to discuss that material now,
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.640]   but get your sleep right
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.300]   so that you can be alert and focused
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.200]   when it comes time to learn.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.380]   Now, the process of being alert and focused
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.800]   on particular material that you want to learn
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.960]   can be enhanced by just having a silent script
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.840]   within your head.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.320]   Silent meaning you're not saying it out loud,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.760]   where when you sit down to learn,
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.720]   you're looking at a book
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.180]   or you're listening to a lecture,
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.380]   perhaps a podcast like this.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.960]   You're thinking, okay, I need to learn this.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.000]   I need to learn this.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.040]   You can voluntarily ramp up your level of focus
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.360]   and alertness by telling yourself
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.560]   that information is important.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.340]   Don't be a passive participant in learning.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.760]   This is the basis of active learning.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.920]   By expecting the information to be so interesting
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.560]   that it pulls your level of attention
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.520]   and focus out of you.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.760]   Rather, learn to engage your attention
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.180]   and focus voluntarily, volitionally, okay?
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.760]   When we hear about ADHD,
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.320]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.080]   we know that people with ADHD can attend very rapidly.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.000]   They can really pay close attention
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.800]   for long periods of time if they like a given topic
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.240]   or a given experience or activity.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.400]   They have serious challenges, however,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   engaging their attention and alertness
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.880]   if they are not excited about an activity or information.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.120]   And so it is the hallmark of all good learners
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.560]   to be able to voluntarily force yourself
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.480]   to attend and to focus.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.240]   And when I say force yourself,
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.680]   that means a constant bringing back of your mind's attention
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.480]   to whatever it is you're trying to learn.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.560]   It is meant to feel difficult.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.800]   I say meant to feel difficult
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.600]   because that strain that you feel,
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.560]   that encouraging, or in some cases, forcing yourself
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.160]   to attend, sometimes even putting on a hoodie and hat,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.560]   you know, literally putting blinders
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.360]   so that you can only attend to the material
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.280]   right in front of you,
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.060]   that straining that you feel reflects, in part,
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.500]   the release of neuromodulators like epinephrine,
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.360]   adrenaline in the brain and body,
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.600]   which serve to cue the neural circuits
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.040]   that they need to change at a later time, okay?
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.300]   So the strain that you feel in trying to learn,
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.440]   the strain that you feel in forcing yourself
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.560]   to learn how to focus, that is good.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.100]   That's a cue to your nervous system
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.160]   that it's going to need to change,
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.280]   that neuroplasticity needs to take place.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.160]   Think about it.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.640]   If you didn't feel that strain
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.480]   and you were able to perform whatever it is
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.440]   that you were doing, or remember,
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.600]   whatever information it is
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.120]   that you're being exposed to seamlessly,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.580]   well, then your nervous system wouldn't have to change
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.920]   because it already has the capabilities
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.560]   within the neural circuits.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.240]   So that strain that you feel, that agitation is great.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.460]   That's a cue that you are learning.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.940]   Or that you've set the learning process in motion.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.300]   Now, it's also the case that some people
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.840]   don't have great levels of focus and attention.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.440]   And there are, of course, pharmacologic tools.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.700]   I would encourage anyone that has clinically diagnosed ADHD
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.580]   to talk to their doctor
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.980]   about whether or not they should use prescription meds
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.820]   and or other methods.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.140]   Great sleep is always going to be an important substrate
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.580]   for attention and focus for anybody,
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.580]   but especially for people with ADHD.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.640]   I highly encourage anyone that's interested
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.400]   in enhancing their levels of focus and attention
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.920]   to also consider the non-pharmacologic approaches.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.520]   So this is irrespective of whether or not
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.420]   you need pharmacologic approaches.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.700]   Yes, being well hydrated.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.260]   Yes, the appropriate amount of caffeine for you
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.500]   that allows you to be alert,
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   but not shaking and agitated can be very useful.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.420]   However, the scientific data also support the fact
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.380]   that doing a brief, say five to 10 minute
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.860]   mindfulness meditation each day.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.020]   These are the data from Wendy Suzuki's laboratory
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.860]   at New York University,
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.140]   showing that people who do a 10 minute meditation per day,
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.740]   where they simply sit or lie down, close their eyes,
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.820]   focus on their breathing,
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.860]   their attention invariably drifts.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.740]   They bring their attention back to their breathing.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.500]   People who do that on a regular basis
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.260]   improve their level of focus.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.640]   They improve their memory and recall ability.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.620]   And of course, there are a bunch of other positive effects
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:02.060]   of that simple zero cost tool of mindfulness meditation.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.860]   So if you're interested in improving your levels of focus
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.900]   and attention for sake of learning,
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.900]   I highly encourage you to explore the oh so valuable tool
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.060]   of mindfulness meditation,
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.580]   just five or 10 minutes per day done on a regular basis.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.580]   You miss a day, no big deal.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.380]   Just get right back to it the next day.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.900]   Does it matter if you do it morning, afternoon, or night?
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.580]   No, some people find that doing it too late at night
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.980]   might disrupt their sleep.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.900]   But if you think about meditation of the sort
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.600]   that I just described as a perceptual exercise,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.980]   maybe you don't even call it meditation.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.720]   You're just teaching yourself to focus.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.180]   You could even do it with eyes open
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.040]   by focusing on a visual target, allowing yourself to blink.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.540]   There are good data on this sort of approach as well.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.920]   And then just making sure that your visual attention
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.940]   and cognitive attention comes back to that visual target
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.860]   over and over again.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.460]   It's a deliberate process of bringing your attention
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.940]   back to a particular location.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.900]   That is very valuable for improving your levels of focus.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.880]   In fact, it is known to create significant improvements
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.100]   in your ability to focus,
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.300]   which is critical for your ability to study and learn.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.260]   So I know that many people are interested in what to take,
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.040]   what to do at the level of kind of esoteric practices
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.140]   or things to buy.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.820]   There is stuff out there.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.420]   Again, I mentioned hydration, caffeine,
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.020]   great sleep, and so on.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.180]   But the simple practice of mindfulness meditation,
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.660]   or just what I describe as a focusing perceptual exercise
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.620]   of bringing your attention back to the same location
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.260]   over and over again, deliberately,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.140]   will train you to train your nervous system
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.440]   to bring your attention back to whatever it is
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.600]   you're trying to learn.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.580]   Now, I've done other podcasts about how to focus,
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.980]   about attention specifically, and ADHD.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.420]   Again, you can find all of those at hubermanlab.com.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.340]   Simply put ADHD or focus or tools for focus
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.380]   into the search function.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.760]   And it will take you to the exact timestamps
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.220]   in those episodes that are relevant.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.760]   Right now, however, I want to talk about the second part
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.120]   of neuroplasticity, which is that the actual changes
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:02.960]   in the nervous system,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.380]   the strengthening and weakening predominantly
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.320]   of connections between neurons that underlie learning
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.500]   do not occur during the focusing and learning,
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.820]   or rather the exposure to the material,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.200]   but instead during deep sleep and sleep-like states.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.740]   And again, I've done a lot of podcasts
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.620]   and talked a lot about tools for getting better sleep,
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.420]   but I just want to remind everybody
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.500]   that the actual reordering of the connections,
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.420]   the strengthening of connections between neurons
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.260]   that underlie learning,
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.860]   the weakening of those connections occurs during sleep
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.140]   in particular, during rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.100]   which tends to predominate in the latter half of the night.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.180]   So make sure that you're getting enough sleep for you.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.300]   For some people it's six hours,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.460]   for some people it's eight hours.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.120]   And yes, there is something called the first night effect.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.340]   The first night effect is the experimentally observed
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.540]   phenomenon whereby information that you learn on a given day
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.360]   is mostly consolidated during the night's sleep
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.260]   that you have on that first night after the learning occurs.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.160]   Does this mean that if you get a poor night's sleep
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.920]   on the first night after learning something
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.760]   that you are forever going to forget that information,
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.300]   that it cannot be consolidated into your neural circuits?
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.180]   No, however, it's very clear
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.900]   that the first night after learning,
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.740]   you want to get the best sleep possible.
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.820]   So if your learning bouts, your studying
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.980]   is going late into the night
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.260]   and you're drinking a lot of caffeine,
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.260]   be mindful that the sleep that you get
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.700]   after drinking that caffeine late into the day,
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.100]   the all-nighters that you're pulling,
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.400]   those are not serving your learning well.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.620]   So you need to structure your life as a student of any kind
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.620]   so that you can get focus and attention
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.980]   to what it is you want to learn,
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.340]   and you can get sleep to the best of your ability.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.500]   And of course, people who are raising young kids
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.500]   or who have stress in their lives for whatever reason,
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.580]   perhaps won't be able to optimize their sleep
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.780]   on that first night or even subsequent nights,
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.620]   but do your best to get your sleep right.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.540]   It's the single best thing you can do
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.340]   for your mental health, for your physical health,
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.860]   and for learning and performance of any kind.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.180]   And it's really worth the effort.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.020]   Now, with an understanding of the mechanisms,
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.220]   the focus and alertness
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.580]   and the sleep phase of neuroplasticity,
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.220]   what are some other things that you can do
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.820]   to enhance whatever studying and learning you've obtained?
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.060]   I already talked about a tool,
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.700]   a behavioral tool for enhancing focus.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.260]   What about a behavioral tool for enhancing plasticity
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.940]   if your sleep is great,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.700]   or especially if your sleep isn't great?
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.180]   And there, I highly recommend you explore
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.340]   non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.980]   There's a script for this in the "Show Note" captions.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.460]   NSDR, sometimes referred to as yoga nidra,
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.180]   although those things are similar but different,
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.460]   is a 10 or 20 minute practice
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.500]   that you can do to restore your mental and physical vigor
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.420]   if you haven't slept enough.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.620]   So you could do it first thing in the morning
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.020]   when you wake up if you feel you haven't slept enough.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.580]   You can do it in the afternoon.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.780]   You can do it in the middle of the night
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.100]   if you're not able to sleep
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.980]   and offset some of the sleep loss
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.780]   that you otherwise would have experienced.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.620]   NSDR is a very powerful tool
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.420]   in order to enhance neuroplasticity.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.720]   And I'll talk more about this in a future episode.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.320]   There's a lot of exciting data coming out
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.620]   about NSDR and yoga nidra.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.620]   But if you're sleeping well, and even if you aren't,
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.380]   I highly encourage you to incorporate a 10 or 20 minute NSDR
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.100]   into your schedule someplace.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.200]   Again, where you place it in your schedule
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.980]   isn't as important as the fact that you do it
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.340]   in order to enhance neuroplasticity.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.700]   That is the reordering of connections between neurons
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.360]   to serve the studying and learning that you're doing.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.260]   Now let's talk about
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.500]   how the best students structure their days.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.500]   Turns out there are great studies on this.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.260]   There's a really nice paper.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.860]   In fact, that surveyed close to 700 students.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.500]   These were medical students,
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.860]   approximately equal number of male and female students
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.500]   and analyze the most useful learning habits.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.580]   That is the learning habits associated
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.200]   with the most successful students.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.060]   Now, anytime you do a study like this
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.500]   where people take surveys,
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.100]   there's always the issue of causality.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.860]   In fact, we can pretty much set aside
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.140]   any possible causality.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.400]   For instance, I'm about to tell you
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.060]   that the very best performing students
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.960]   tend to study for about three or four hours per day.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.500]   But you could easily say,
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.620]   well, they're the best students
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.460]   because they study three or four hours per day.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.260]   They don't study three or four hours per day
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.260]   because they're the best students.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.180]   And you'd be exactly right, okay?
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.900]   We can get into all sorts of discussions
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.780]   about correlation versus causation,
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.600]   about reverse causality and on and on.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.460]   However, none of that is the point here.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.380]   The point here is to establish
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.640]   what are the habits that the most successful students
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.720]   seem to incorporate over and over again,
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.360]   regardless of what classes they're taking,
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.240]   regardless of where they are
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.480]   in their arc of their learning trajectory.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.540]   And so what we know based on this study,
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.200]   and I'll provide a link to it in the show note captions,
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.000]   is that there are at least 10 study habits
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.600]   that the highly effective students use.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.300]   I'm going to focus on the top five or six
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.780]   just for sake of time,
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.640]   because it turns out that most of the effect,
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.880]   it appears, of being a better student
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.240]   can be attributed to these top five or six habits.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.840]   First of all, they set aside time to study.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.820]   They literally schedule time to study.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.800]   Now this probably serves several roles.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.000]   The first one is that they are able
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.740]   to clear out other distractions.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.320]   And in fact, that's the second thing that they do.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.800]   They are very effective where they make it a point
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.320]   of putting their phone away and off,
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.720]   of isolating themselves.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.900]   That's right, they're not studying with other people.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.180]   They study alone, which is not to say
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.480]   that people who study with others
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.620]   cannot be effective in their studying,
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.040]   but the best performing students seem to study alone.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.540]   They put their phone away.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.400]   They tell their friends and families
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.600]   that they are not going to be able to be reached
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.920]   during that time.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.600]   And yes, they study for three or four hours per day,
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.040]   but they break that up
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.160]   into a couple of different sessions typically,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.240]   two or three sessions.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.000]   So they're not doing a three or four hour studying
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.360]   about all in one shot.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.960]   So they're managing their time,
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.680]   they're eliminating distractions,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.980]   and they're studying for a consistent amount of time,
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.900]   at least five days per week, okay?
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.660]   Presumably they're taking some weekends off,
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.860]   although that wasn't made clear from this paper.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.820]   The other thing that they do, and this is very important,
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.900]   is that they make an effort to then teach their peers,
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.920]   to teach other students in the class.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.480]   Now, some of you may be thinking,
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.220]   and I'm thinking back to college here, mostly,
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.400]   that if you spend all this time learning the information
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.140]   and you are in a competitive scenario
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.220]   with the other students,
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.780]   that teaching them the information
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.460]   is kind of a freebie for them and it's harder for you,
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.420]   meaning you're putting yourself
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.140]   at a competitive disadvantage,
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.380]   or you're giving them an unfair advantage
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.000]   for not having done the work.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.740]   Now, while this paper didn't do an analysis
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.680]   of whether or not these students
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.040]   that served as the learners from the other students
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.340]   got an unfair advantage,
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.880]   it's very clear that students who make it a point
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.620]   to learn material in isolation,
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.500]   then bring that material to other students
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.520]   in the same course and teach them,
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.220]   perform exceedingly well
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.940]   in comparison to the other students.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.020]   So don't be afraid to be a teacher of your peers
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.020]   in order to test, this is key,
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.140]   to test and develop mastery of the material.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.820]   Now, in my laboratory for years,
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.820]   we used to have a saying,
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.180]   which I simply picked up from the laboratories
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.740]   I was trained in, I didn't come up with the saying,
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.980]   which was, "Watch one, do one, teach one."
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.100]   And that was referring to doing surgeries or suturing
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.140]   or doing an antibody reaction or a Western blot
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.040]   or things that you do in laboratories.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.520]   Watch one, do one, teach one.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.740]   Watch one, do one, teach one,
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.220]   of course should be reserved to anything
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.060]   where no one's going to be put in danger
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.520]   by the watch one, do one, teach one procedure, right?
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.900]   Some procedures, especially in laboratories,
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.100]   can be dangerous given the materials you use, et cetera.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.640]   And of course, today we're talking about learning
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.660]   and studying generally.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.620]   So provided it's safe, watch one, do one, teach one
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.940]   is an excellent means to learn,
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.620]   that is to study new material,
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.460]   to develop proficiency and even mastery.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.740]   And over time, perhaps even virtuosity.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.100]   We'll return to that later, those distinctions.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.500]   So going back to this idea
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.300]   that the best students set aside time,
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.980]   they designate time to study alone without distractions,
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.080]   that is sure to help them anchor their focus and attention.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.540]   They know that they're going to need to use their focus
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.820]   and attention during that time.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.240]   And we know with absolute certainty that focus
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.780]   and attention are a limited but renewable resource
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.620]   in the human brain.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.460]   The longer you're awake,
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.500]   the more is the buildup of a molecule called adenosine
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.340]   in your brain and body.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.760]   It makes you sleepy, makes it harder to focus.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.380]   When you sleep, adenosine levels are pushed down again.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.700]   You're able to focus again, you feel more alert.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.620]   You can think of adenosine
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.660]   as limiting your attentional budget,
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.620]   which is not to say that some people don't study best
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.780]   in the afternoon or in the evening
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.140]   or even late at night, right?
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.500]   I recall times during university when I'd study
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.820]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.,
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:48.900]   I don't do that any longer.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:53.200]   But scheduling time where you know you're going to need
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.480]   to be focused and attending is perhaps one
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.900]   of the most important things toward being able to focus
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.020]   and attend to the material.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.820]   Now, if you're taking courses,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.780]   you probably are going to be a slave
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.820]   to the timing of the courses.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.580]   You aren't going to be able to tell the instructor,
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.580]   "Okay, listen, I want you to do this course at 3 p.m.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.900]   "because that's when you learn best or at 8 a.m.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.380]   "because that's when you happen to be able to attend best."
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.700]   However, to the extent that you have any control
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.300]   over the time in which you're going to study,
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.900]   keeping that at a regular time or times,
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.360]   perhaps one block early in the day,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.900]   one block later in the day,
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.460]   perhaps two blocks early in the day, and so on,
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.500]   is going to be beneficial.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.140]   It turns out that's also supported
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.540]   by the research literature,
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.420]   that the brain, just like with its sleep-wake cycles,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.780]   that entrain to a regular schedule,
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.580]   that is, your brain and body get used to being active
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.580]   and inactive at particular times based
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.940]   on your exposure to sunlight, your exposure to activities,
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.860]   your social rhythms, et cetera.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.860]   If you regularly, meaning for the course of about three days
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.820]   make it a point to focus and study at particular times,
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.260]   again, pulling your attention back,
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.420]   it's not an automatic process,
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.660]   but pulling your attention back to a specific location,
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.900]   perhaps on a page or that you're listening to in a lecture,
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:09.260]   your body and brain will start to entrain to that rhythm
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.580]   such that you will be able to focus and attend better
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.900]   simply by virtue of the regularity of the timing
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.780]   of the exposure to the material, okay?
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.300]   So you probably need about two or three days
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.500]   to break into a regular schedule of focusing and attending
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.060]   and studying at a given time or times.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.720]   Allow yourself that transition period,
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.740]   but then make it a point to schedule those times to study,
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.420]   set aside your phone, tell people you're going offline,
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.020]   turn off the Wi-Fi if you need to or have to.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.980]   You may need it for your studying, I don't know,
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.300]   depends on what you're studying,
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.620]   but limit distractions at all costs
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.380]   and learn to just focus on the material.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.700]   And this is a skill,
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.140]   this is the most important thing to understand,
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.780]   it's a skill to be able to focus and study.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.340]   And it's a skill that you can learn very quickly,
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.780]   especially if you schedule it for regular times
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.120]   and you give yourself two or three days
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.300]   in which to adapt to those schedules and times
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.860]   and then try and stick to them as regularly as possible,
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.340]   perhaps even on the weekends, if you're approaching,
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.020]   you know, the end of the quarter or semester,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.060]   perhaps even on the weekend,
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.580]   even if you're not in the quarter or semester.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.600]   Keeping those regular times will entrain your nervous system
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.740]   to study and learn at its best at those particular times.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.980]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.620]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.220]   By now, many of you have heard me say
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.980]   that if I could take just one supplement,
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.080]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.620]   The reason for that is AG1 is the highest quality
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.500]   and most complete
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.260]   of the foundational nutritional supplements available.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.680]   What that means is that it contains
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.060]   not just vitamins and minerals,
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:43.460]   but also probiotics, prebiotics and adaptogens
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.900]   to cover any gaps you may have in your diet
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.180]   and provide support for a demanding life.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.020]   For me, even if I eat mostly whole foods
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.240]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.180]   which I do for most of my food intake,
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.180]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.860]   and vegetables, vitamins and minerals, micronutrients
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.060]   and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.500]   For that reason, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.160]   and often twice a day, once in the morning or mid morning
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.180]   and again in the afternoon or evening.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.600]   When I do that, it clearly bolsters my energy,
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.180]   my immune system and my gut microbiome.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.340]   These are all critical to brain function, mood,
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.560]   physical performance and much more.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.020]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.140]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.720]   to claim their special offer.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.860]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.720]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.340]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.960]   to claim that special offer.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.620]   Before I move into specific ways to study
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:40.340]   in order to maximally offset forgetting,
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.220]   notice I didn't say in order to learn,
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.740]   but rather to maximally offset forgetting,
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.160]   AKA learning, stably learning material.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.500]   There's one other point that I wanted to pass along
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.060]   from this really nice study on the study habits
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.020]   of highly effective medical students
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.020]   that I've been referring to.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.700]   And that is when one examined
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.920]   or these people were asked about their motivation
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.140]   for studying, the best performing students
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.540]   had an interesting answer.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.900]   They had a very long-term understanding
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.020]   of how, or belief rather,
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.660]   about how their success in medical school
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.300]   would impact their family,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.080]   how it would impact their life arc,
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.620]   how it would change them.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.580]   And they weren't particular about the ways
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.400]   in which it would change them or their family.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.460]   In fact, it was a rather broad, abstract, aspirational way
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.940]   of thinking about their study efforts.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.300]   So what I like so much about this paper is that,
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.060]   you know, in addition to having a fairly large sample size,
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.420]   close to 700 students that were evaluated,
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.580]   and yes, it's purely, you know,
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.920]   self-report and this kind of thing.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.060]   Nonetheless, it bridges the two extremes
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.380]   of studying and learning.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.200]   You know, it gets right down into the nitty gritty
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.220]   of how long they study, when they study,
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.180]   the things they do to limit distraction
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.980]   that we just discussed.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.200]   But it also gets to their underlying
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.860]   psychological motivations and the thing that they use
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.940]   in order to pull them forward through their study efforts,
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.500]   perhaps, especially when their desire is waning
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.980]   or their level of fatigue is increasing.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.780]   I don't know that, I'm speculating here,
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.700]   but this is this aspirational component
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.380]   of going to medical school,
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.620]   which it turns out in the country
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.460]   in which this study was done,
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.780]   only very, very select few of the very best students
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.620]   are able to achieve that.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.780]   And they have to learn the information
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.260]   in a different language altogether, which is incredible.
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.380]   I always marvel at that.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.580]   You know, I have friends that did their PhD thesis
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.340]   in Italy, they're Italian by birth.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.340]   They now happen to run a laboratory in Italy
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.300]   and they had to do their PhD training and write papers
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.380]   and give their thesis dissertation and defense in English,
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.420]   even though English was their second language.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.620]   So talk about a challenge.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.260]   And that's just one example that I can think of.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.860]   There are many examples of that.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.740]   These students that I'm referring to in this study
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:03.180]   are not necessarily constantly thinking about
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.740]   how their efforts will transform themselves
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:06.980]   and their families,
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.420]   but they certainly were able to report
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.700]   what it was specifically that they are seeking,
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.300]   what they're aspiring to,
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.940]   besides just trying to do as well as they can
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.980]   getting into and through medical school.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.020]   So the high-level aspirational stuff within you,
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.220]   whatever that is for you,
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.500]   it's going to be highly individual,
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.020]   is certainly important.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.540]   And it offers a bookend to the nuts and bolts
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.300]   kind of stuff that you're going to do,
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.140]   I would hope,
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.980]   in order to best study and learn the specific material.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.380]   So the specific actions that you're going to take each day
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.180]   to learn specific bits of information
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.420]   that will pull you toward those important aspirations.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.820]   And now again, if you love the material you're learning,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.100]   this aspirational component is probably not as important.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.220]   I can recall during university and graduate school
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.860]   and so on, thinking, oh my goodness,
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.260]   this is like the coolest thing I've ever heard.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.340]   I've probably said that about a million different topics.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.660]   Like, oh my goodness, circadian rhythms, seasonal rhythms,
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.380]   melatonin, neural circuits, dopamine.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.140]   I was just awash with excitement about what I was learning.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.940]   But of course, sometimes I would take a course
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.540]   where the material was,
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.980]   I don't know if it was more challenging or not,
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.180]   but I had a harder time getting engaged by the material,
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.460]   either by virtue of how it was being taught to me
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.940]   or the material itself.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.460]   So the ability to attach to some aspirational goal,
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.060]   to pull you through, can be very valuable.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.940]   You're not going to love every topic you have to learn.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.140]   However, I will say that, at least in my experience,
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.940]   some of the courses that I look back on most fondly
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.820]   are the courses that I struggled with the most.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.500]   And in fact, that's the basis of the next
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.980]   and easily one of the most important studying tools.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.100]   So a key theme in all of the excellent literature,
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.900]   that is the peer-reviewed research on how best to study,
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.220]   is that studying that feels challenging
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.900]   is the most effective.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.700]   I know nobody wants to hear this.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.940]   Everyone wants to hear about flow.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.400]   Everybody wants to hear about information
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.500]   just sinking into their brain by osmosis.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.000]   I think it was a Garfield cartoon
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.140]   where he talked about learning by osmosis.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.060]   There's this very cute real-world video
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.280]   of a kid in a classroom.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.200]   I believe it's in China where he's taking the book
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.100]   and he puts it on his head.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.140]   Maybe I can find this clip.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.200]   And he's just kind of like trying to wash it into his brain.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.220]   It's super cute clip, but guess what?
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.200]   That doesn't work.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.020]   I mean, it works to put the book on your head.
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:23.900]   It doesn't work.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.060]   It's not going to get the information into your brain.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.740]   Perhaps someday there will be ways
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.580]   to rapidly download information into neural circuits.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.140]   Right now, we know, we've known for hundreds,
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.580]   if not thousands of years,
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.580]   that effort is the cornerstone of learning.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.980]   So I know there are probably some groans about that.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.440]   I know some of you perhaps were hoping
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.720]   that today I was going to tell you how to study
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.140]   so that studying wasn't painful.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.060]   I think I can accomplish that by the end of today's episode.
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.960]   But in order to do that, let's take another quiz.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.220]   Okay, so here's the quiz.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.340]   Again, you can answer these questions in your head.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.060]   You don't have to tell anyone,
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:02.940]   but you could write them down
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.880]   or say them out loud if you want.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.500]   The first question is,
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:13.380]   when during either your states of alertness or sleep,
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:17.900]   does the remodeling of neural connections occur?
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.500]   I like to think this is a pretty easy one.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.680]   Okay, the answer is during sleep.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.100]   The second question is, what is one behavioral tool
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.120]   that you can use to improve focus?
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.860]   The answer is simple mindfulness meditation,
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.740]   which I prefer you think of simply as a perceptual exercise.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.740]   So again, just sit or lie down, close your eyes,
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.580]   focus on your breath.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.940]   When your attention drifts,
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.500]   bring your attention back to your breath and so on.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.680]   Or if you prefer, you can do this eyes open
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.860]   by focusing on a visual target,
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.740]   either a foot or two feet or three feet away,
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.120]   whatever distance is comfortable for you,
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.660]   allowing yourself to blink as needed,
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:59.460]   but forcing yourself to focus on that visual target
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.460]   for say one to three minutes,
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.700]   maybe even three to five minutes,
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.720]   maybe even 10 minutes.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.540]   Again, please blink, you don't want your eyes to dry.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.540]   Both those tools will improve your ability to attend,
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.860]   to focus to other material when the time comes, okay?
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.300]   The circuits for focus and attention themselves
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.860]   are subject to neuroplasticity.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.200]   And then the third question is,
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.540]   can you name or list off in your mind three tools
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.340]   that the most effective students have been shown to use?
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:32.640]   I can think of limiting distraction
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.120]   by virtue of putting away phones
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.720]   and telling others you won't be in contact with them too.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.480]   And I'm getting these out of order, I realize,
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.820]   is to isolate, to study alone.
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.000]   And the third that I can recall
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   is to teach others in the same course, okay?
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.340]   You can probably think of a few others.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.560]   Now, why are we taking these silly little quizzes?
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.720]   Well, it turns out they're not so silly
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.780]   when one considers that hopefully
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.980]   you'll remember the information from today
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.660]   so that you don't have to listen to it over and over again,
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:11.660]   but that if ever there was a strongly research-supported tool
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.020]   in the literature, in the peer-reviewed literature
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.880]   about how students can learn information better,
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.820]   it's testing.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.620]   And I know, I know, I know we think of tests
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.940]   as a way to evaluate our knowledge,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.400]   but it turns out that testing is one of the best ways
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.500]   to build our knowledge, to retain our knowledge,
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.860]   and again, to offset forgetting.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.180]   Now, the study of testing as a learning tool,
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.400]   not just as a way to evaluate
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.220]   how much information we've learned,
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.140]   goes back over a hundred years.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.620]   There's a classic study that was done in 1917
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:49.620]   where grade school aged children read biographies.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.300]   So they read biographies,
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.860]   and then the kids were divided into different groups.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:59.680]   One group read and reread and reread those biographies
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.220]   over and over.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.020]   Another group read the biographies once,
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.180]   and then were tested on those biographies.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.760]   But get this, they tested themselves on those biographies
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.820]   simply by having to think about the information
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.500]   that they had read and trying to remember the information,
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.520]   like what was the biography?
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.360]   Who is the person?
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.180]   Who are they married to?
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.020]   What did they do?
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.460]   When did they go to school?
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.620]   What did they do in school?
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.860]   What did they do in the world?
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.340]   What role did they play in life?
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.140]   So they essentially tested their own knowledge
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.540]   simply by going into their own head and asking themselves
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.980]   what they could remember about those biographies.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.980]   Now, keep in mind here that even though it's fairly apparent
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.620]   that reading a biography two, three, four times
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:48.780]   might seem more passive than testing oneself on a biography
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.480]   that they had read just once, right?
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.020]   You could imagine that thinking about the biography
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.680]   involves more effort, and indeed it does.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.360]   But keep in mind also that the kids in the second group
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.920]   were only exposed to the biography once.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.920]   And yet when you look at the percent of accurate recall
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.960]   of information from those biographies,
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.780]   the children that read the biography once
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.720]   and then made a deliberate point
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.840]   to think about that biography in their own mind
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.560]   to effectively test themselves on that material
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.340]   just within their heads over and over,
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.400]   but an equal number of times as the kids
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:29.440]   that read the biographies directly on a page over and over,
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.420]   vastly outperformed the kids
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.060]   that read the biographies over and over.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.240]   Put differently, reading and rereading material
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:40.680]   and rereading material is far less effective
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.040]   than reading material and then thinking about that material,
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.620]   testing yourself on that material,
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.720]   forcing yourself to bring that material to mind
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.320]   in your own mind.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.960]   And this is not just for sake of remembering
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.660]   more volume of material,
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:58.800]   but also accuracy of recall of that material.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.080]   And that at least to me was pretty surprising at first
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.340]   until one starts to explore subsequent studies
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.960]   of the role of testing as a learning tool.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.600]   And then you start to realize that testing yourself
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.480]   is far and away the best tool for studying and learning,
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.680]   not just for evaluating your knowledge,
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.980]   but for actually studying and incorporating that knowledge
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.160]   into your neural circuits.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.320]   Okay, so I realized that anytime I or somebody else
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.440]   talks about a study that was done in 1917,
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.640]   we think of people in these, you know,
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.000]   like wooden shoes and in these school houses
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.500]   that look so different and kids dress so different.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.060]   Let's get a little more modern here.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:39.900]   Keep in mind, however,
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.740]   that the nervous system hasn't really changed much
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.320]   in tens of thousands of years.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.380]   Nonetheless, I think it's nice to think about
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.260]   a more recent study of how best to study.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.420]   And this study, which by the way,
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.260]   we'll provide a link to in the show note captions,
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.700]   as well as a couple of reviews
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.100]   that include results from similar studies.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.360]   Again, I'm pointing to a body of research,
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.780]   not just one study here.
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:08.620]   Looked at whether or not studying material four times.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:13.620]   So study, study, study, study was better
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:18.060]   in terms of locking that information into people's minds,
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.460]   allowing them to use that information flexibly,
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.380]   which is an element of creativity,
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.620]   essentially given the mastery of the material.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:28.100]   Then a different group, which studied once,
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.380]   studied the material twice,
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.360]   studied the material three times,
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.880]   then was tested on the material.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:40.240]   Or a third group that studied material once,
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.120]   then took one, two, yes, three tests on the material.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.920]   Now, so what I just described was three groups,
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.680]   all of whom read a passage.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.240]   This was a passage about animals, about biology,
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.680]   some other topics too in different experiments.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.140]   Again, three groups, one group studies four times.
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.900]   They study the material one, two, three, four times,
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.180]   then later they take a test.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:09.320]   The second group studies one, two, three times,
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.440]   takes a test on that material,
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.160]   and then later takes a test.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.480]   The third group studies the material once,
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.240]   then takes three tests on the material,
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.160]   and then later takes a test.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.000]   So what's analyzed and compared
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.600]   between these different groups
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:28.320]   is their performance on that final test, okay?
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.820]   What I put in as the fifth bin there, right?
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.620]   'Cause it was, think about it as SSSS,
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.940]   so study, study, study, study, and then later test.
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:41.740]   Or SSST, study, study, study, test, and then later test.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.500]   Or STTT, study, test, test, test, and then later test.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.400]   So what's compared and contrasted
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.380]   is performance on the test some period of time later.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:55.300]   Now, some experiments made that final test of the material
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.620]   a couple of days later,
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.960]   other experiments made it a couple of weeks later,
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.120]   other experiments made it much later,
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.340]   months or even a year later, okay?
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.680]   The point here is twofold.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:10.480]   First of all, based on everything I've told you thus far,
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.520]   you can probably guess who performed best
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.900]   on the test that occurred some period of time later, okay?
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.920]   Right.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.240]   The performance on that final test
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.860]   was essentially proportional to the number of tests
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.780]   one had already taken on the material, okay?
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.940]   That should be pretty much obvious
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.620]   given the way we've been going today
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.220]   in this description of tests as a way to offset forgetting.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.100]   Okay, so the more tests that you take
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:43.520]   as a way to expose yourself to the material,
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.580]   the better you're going to perform on that material
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.460]   at some later point.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.260]   Now, of course, at some point you have to be exposed
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.140]   to the material for the first time, right?
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.940]   That's why it's studying and learning.
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.220]   But after one exposure to new material,
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.920]   taking more tests on that material,
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.560]   even if you don't perform that well on those tests,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.080]   as long as you're able to see the accurate answers
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.920]   to those tests and compare your answers to those answers
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.800]   will lead to better performance on the ultimate test
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.300]   and retention of that material at some later time.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.240]   Put differently,
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.740]   it's not about how many times you study the material
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.960]   or how many times you're exposed to the material.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.320]   It's about being exposed to the material,
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.780]   doing your best to focus and attend to that material,
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:26.340]   and then self-testing yourself on that material.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.340]   Or as the case may be,
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.940]   if an instructor is the one giving you the test,
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.140]   but nonetheless taking tests on that material,
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:37.540]   not just once, but ideally two or three times,
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:39.820]   that's what really locks the material
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.900]   into your neural circuits.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:44.260]   That's what's going to lead to the most pervasive change,
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.860]   the most durable change, we should say,
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.100]   in your neural circuits that carry that material,
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.520]   that hold that material in your mind,
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.820]   what we call neural encoding, okay?
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.720]   So the more times you test yourself
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.280]   or that you are tested on material,
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.600]   the better your retention of that material.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.480]   Now, some people will immediately say,
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.760]   well, goodness, what if I learned it and then I'm tested
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.160]   and I'm somehow consolidating the wrong
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.280]   or inaccurate material?
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.880]   But it doesn't appear to be the case.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.120]   As long as you learn what the correct answers
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.340]   to the tests are, even if you're getting, you know,
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:20.080]   40 or 50% or less accurate on those tests that you take,
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.100]   immediately after the studying period,
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.280]   that's still going to be a better strategy
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.800]   than rereading the material,
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.080]   which ought to be somewhat surprising.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.340]   It certainly was surprising to me,
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:32.960]   but you know what's even more surprising
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.920]   and a little scary and that we all should know,
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.400]   and I wish I had learned when I was like
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   in the second grade, is that if you ask students,
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:46.040]   how confident are you in the material that you just learned?
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.640]   How well do you think you would perform on a test?
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.160]   What you see consistently in these studies, I'm chuckling,
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.320]   because it's kind of mind-blowing,
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.080]   is that the students who studied the material,
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.240]   that is who were exposed to the material four times,
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.520]   think that they are going to perform best
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.000]   on the ultimate exam.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.680]   However, the students that study the material once
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.440]   and then are tested three times on that material,
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.080]   they think that ultimately
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.000]   they're going to perform least well.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.380]   For instance, they ask them their confidence,
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.640]   how well do you think you would perform
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.880]   on a test of this material in two weeks,
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.960]   or in a year, or in six months, or even tomorrow?
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.120]   They report, that is the students
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.520]   in the study, test, test, test group,
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.960]   report much lower confidence in the material,
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.720]   much lower sense of mastery of the material
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.640]   compared to the students
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.040]   that were exposed to the material four times,
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.400]   who are saying, yeah, I think I would do pretty well
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.160]   or very well, and guess what?
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.760]   The exact opposite is true.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.280]   Put differently, when you're exposed to material
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.000]   over and over and over again,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.740]   you think you've learned the material.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.120]   In fact, your confidence that you've learned the material
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:57.840]   increases with each subsequent exposure to the material,
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.440]   but actually you haven't learned it at all
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:04.240]   compared to the people that are exposed to the material
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.960]   and then take tests on the material,
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.940]   oftentimes straining to get the answers right on those tests.
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.600]   In fact, sometimes getting those answers dead wrong
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.680]   and then realizing they get those answers dead wrong,
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.120]   or sometimes they just sense it, but guess what?
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.760]   Testing yourself once, twice, maybe three times
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:23.240]   prior to the ultimate test of your knowledge
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.680]   of that material is far and away the best way
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.160]   to lock that material into those neural circuits.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.440]   Now, I say, I wish I had learned this when I was a student
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.080]   because to some extent I used a self-testing approach.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.000]   The one most salient example of that is I took a course
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.080]   when I was in college, I still remember,
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.200]   it was Biosciences 169L, Neuroanatomy Laboratory
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.900]   taught by Ben Rees, he's still there, I believe.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:54.420]   And he was known then, and I'm sure still now
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:59.380]   if he's still teaching as extremely challenging professor,
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.320]   extremely challenging, not as a person,
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:05.260]   not his personality, but a ton of detail and rigor
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.640]   and high, high, high expectation
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.560]   for this laboratory course in neuroanatomy,
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.560]   which involved lectures,
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.440]   it involved in a neuroanatomy textbook
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.500]   where you'd look at essentially panels
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.280]   of different brain sections from different species,
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.740]   different types of stains of different brain tissue.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.440]   Mind you, this is an undergraduate course.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.200]   And then there was a laboratory component,
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.520]   hence the L in 169L, where you'd have to go
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.280]   from microscope station to microscope station,
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.440]   identifying structures based simply
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.620]   on what you could see down the microscope.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.680]   And therefore you had to know what the stain was,
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.280]   what was essentially visible to you on the slide
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.960]   because certain stains reveal certain things
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.160]   like what we call the cell body of neurons
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.540]   versus the sort of wires,
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.480]   what we call the axons between neurons, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.800]   I remember thinking, this is a really hard course.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.600]   It was a very difficult course.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.760]   And my mode of studying for the course involved,
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.280]   of course, going to class, doing the dissection.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.420]   We dissected a sheep brain at that time.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.760]   So we're literally dissecting an actual brain.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.400]   We're doing microscope work.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.120]   We're learning about it from the textbook and from lecture.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.960]   And there was a ton of new nomenclature
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.260]   about rostral, caudal, dorsal, ventral,
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.600]   all the stuff of neuroanatomy.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.720]   And then at some point I made the decision,
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.380]   perhaps on the basis of sheer overwhelm,
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:27.120]   to study for neuroanatomy by laying down on my bed
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.000]   in my studio apartment, I lived alone,
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   and closing my eyes and flying through the nervous system
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.240]   from different entry points, through the ear,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.480]   review my cochlear anatomy,
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.800]   through the eye, review my retinal anatomy,
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.040]   through the dorsal surface of the brain,
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.620]   thinking about the sulci and gyri,
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.800]   and then the corpus callosum.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.960]   And I can still see it in my mind's eye.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.440]   So my process of studying for neuroanatomy,
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.920]   yes, involved exposure to the material,
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.680]   but it involved hours upon hours
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:05.460]   of thinking about the material within my own brain.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.620]   So it's a little bit meta unto itself there.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.640]   As a consequence, I like to think,
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.520]   in fact, I believe with some confidence
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.680]   that I have a very high mastery of neuroanatomy
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.560]   in different species as well.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.840]   Now, that's my particular area of expertise.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.320]   I don't think I'm any kind of savant
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.360]   with respect to neuroanatomy.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.000]   I just spent hours upon hours learning the material
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.820]   and then reviewing the material within my mind.
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:32.880]   So in other words, testing myself,
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.960]   here's what I would do if I were moving down a trajectory
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.320]   of a neural tract, for instance,
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.620]   between, say, the hippocampus and a neighboring structure,
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.420]   and I didn't know what was next,
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:44.840]   I would then go look it up in the textbook,
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.580]   and then I'd go back to this mental exercise,
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.100]   visualization-type studying.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.900]   It really wasn't studying is the point.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.120]   The point is that I was testing myself.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.700]   I was trying to find the points
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.300]   in which I no longer had the knowledge to move further
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.780]   through, in this case, my mental image of the brain,
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.180]   but through the material.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:05.740]   And this is the key aspect of testing.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:09.460]   It's not about just knowing how many things you get right,
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:10.780]   how many things you get wrong.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.300]   It's about recognizing exactly what you know and don't know.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.160]   And an important component of testing
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.460]   is running up against those things where you say,
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.900]   "Ugh, I can't remember.
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.040]   "I don't know what comes next."
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.760]   Or I'm certain that that structure is the fimbria,
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.000]   and then you go and you look and you go,
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.240]   "Ugh, it's not the fimbria."
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.080]   But guess what?
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.460]   I'll never forget, for instance,
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.620]   the location of the habenula or what it looks like,
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:33.920]   a structure of which, by the way,
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.140]   since these names are kind of esoteric,
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.360]   at that time, we didn't know what it does.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.040]   It turns out it's involved in disappointment.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.640]   It's key to the depression circuit,
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.160]   so the circuits that underlie depression
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.580]   in some individuals.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.840]   It is suppressed by viewing of morning sunlight.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.920]   We know that too.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.440]   And by getting too much artificial light exposure
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.280]   in the middle of the night,
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.740]   you enhance activity of the habenula.
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.560]   Beautiful work not done by my laboratory,
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.360]   but by other laboratories demonstrates that.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.120]   So what I just did for you there
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.800]   was hopefully teach you a little something
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.900]   about neuroanatomy and depression,
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.180]   but more importantly, to just illustrate
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.820]   that how you test yourself can be highly individual
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.600]   to the ways in which you learn best.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.860]   Now, that contradicts what I said earlier,
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.000]   which is that this notion
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.520]   that people have different learning styles,
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.920]   and some people are verbal learners,
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.380]   and some people are auditory learners, and et cetera,
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.140]   doesn't really hold up so well anymore,
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.340]   but which, by the way, is not to say
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.080]   there isn't any research to support it.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.760]   It's just that it's heavily contradicted
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.500]   by other research that contradicts that idea.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:38.500]   But your approach, your mode of best testing yourself
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.580]   on material for sake of offsetting the forgetting process,
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.460]   and for identifying where you have gaps in your knowledge,
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.580]   or where you thought you knew something, but you don't,
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.900]   or you knew something, but it's wrong,
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.520]   that can be accomplished
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.620]   through the approach that's best for you,
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.700]   which in my case turned out to be lying down
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.340]   and thinking about the material in my head.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.820]   And still to this day, when I read a paper,
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.280]   I try, I don't always do this,
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.600]   but what I try to do is then take a walk in my yard
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.040]   or outside, and I try and think
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.680]   about the key components of that paper,
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.080]   and think about some of the graphs
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.760]   that are especially important,
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.280]   which is what I'm going to do now.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.400]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.680]   to thank one of our sponsors, Element.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.120]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.280]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.480]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.140]   and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.280]   Now, I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.260]   about the critical importance of hydration
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.440]   for proper brain and bodily function.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.120]   Research shows that even a slight degree
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.840]   of dehydration can really diminish cognitive
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.080]   and physical performance.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.400]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.120]   in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.680]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.080]   are critical for the functioning
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.280]   of all the cells in your body,
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.260]   especially your neurons or nerve cells.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.720]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.340]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.800]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.700]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.880]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.480]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.200]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.360]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.320]   especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.480]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.680]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.400]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman,
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.240]   spelled drinkelement.com/huberman,
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.960]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.240]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.380]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.980]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.720]   Okay, so I like to think that we're establishing
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.600]   that testing yourself or testing your students
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.060]   or being tested by your teacher
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.300]   is the best way to offset forgetting.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.560]   Let's look at the literature
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.240]   that actually supports that statement directly.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.120]   Because in the previous experiment I described,
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.720]   it was either study, study, study, study,
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.880]   or study, study, study, test,
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.200]   or study, test, test, test,
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.280]   and then later everybody takes a test at the same time.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.460]   A variance on that was done
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:54.440]   where they had one group of students study material.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.880]   So this is new material.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.800]   And when I say study,
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.800]   I mean they were exposed to the material for the first time.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.920]   And I realize this is a little bit of a problem
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.120]   'cause we're using the word study when,
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.340]   in fact, I'm trying to make the point
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.720]   that testing yourself is studying, okay?
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.520]   So forgive me, but this is the way it's mapped out
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.120]   in these experiments and these papers,
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.620]   should you look them up in our show note captions.
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:19.180]   One group is exposed to the material,
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.440]   what we call studying,
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.440]   and then takes a test immediately after.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.880]   They are told what they got right,
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.180]   what they got wrong on that test,
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.600]   and what the correct answers are.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.400]   And then sometime later after a delay,
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.960]   they take a test of the same material.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.880]   Another group studies,
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.400]   that is they're exposed to the material,
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.360]   then there's a delay, okay?
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.020]   That delay could be days, it could be weeks.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.520]   This experiment has been done every which way,
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.520]   it seems by now.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.160]   Then they're tested,
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.080]   and then there's another delay,
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.840]   and then they take a test at the same time
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.660]   that group one did, okay?
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.760]   So again, it's study, test,
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.000]   long delay, test for group one,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.480]   or study, delay, test,
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.420]   delay, test for group two.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.600]   Remember the final test is taken
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.060]   at the same time by everybody.
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.200]   Or group three, study,
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.640]   that is they're exposed to the material,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.240]   then a long, long, long, long, long delay,
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:16.000]   then a test, and then the ultimate test, okay?
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.800]   The test that everybody takes at the same time.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.340]   Can you guess which group performed best?
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.880]   And the essence of this experiment,
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.760]   if you're listening to this
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.840]   and it's not clear in your mind,
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.960]   is you're either exposed to the material
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.500]   and tested very soon after,
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.960]   and then take a test after a delay,
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.520]   say a week or two weeks later,
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.160]   or you're exposed to the material,
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.640]   there's a delay of a few days,
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.720]   then you take a test,
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.640]   and then another few days,
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.480]   and then you take a test,
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.160]   so it's more evenly spaced.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.120]   Or if you were assigned to the third group,
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.200]   you'd study,
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.720]   you're not going to see the material
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.060]   or be tested on it until a day or two
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.560]   before the big test,
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.480]   then you're tested on it,
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.380]   you get your answers back,
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.580]   and then you're tested on it again.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.260]   You could imagine that the last group
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.380]   might perform best
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.700]   because they're re-exposed to the material,
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.380]   they're told what the correct answers are,
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.820]   so they know what they got wrong,
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:01.780]   they know what they got right,
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.220]   and then the next day,
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.680]   they're taking the test again.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.080]   I would have thought that group would perform best,
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.840]   but it turns out the opposite is true.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.380]   It's pretty wild.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.660]   The best performance comes
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.500]   from being exposed to material,
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.620]   what in this experiment they're called studying, okay?
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.260]   So they read a passage
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.540]   or they learn some math material
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.620]   or language material
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.580]   or music material
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.720]   or motor learning,
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.340]   then they take a test very soon after,
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.820]   even same day or next day.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.580]   And then there's a long delay
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.540]   and then they take the test.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.400]   That group performs best.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.460]   Put differently,
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.020]   test yourself very soon,
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.020]   if not the same day,
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.000]   certainly the next day or so,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.140]   very soon after being exposed to material
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.900]   for the first time,
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.200]   as opposed to the last group,
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.100]   which performs worst.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.140]   They perform worse.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.600]   Being exposed to material,
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.820]   then there's a long period of time,
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.620]   then you're tested on that material.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.260]   You are told what you got right,
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.080]   what you got wrong.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.160]   And then the next day you take a test again,
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.420]   even with overlapping questions
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.020]   to the test you took just the day before.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.640]   And that group performs worst.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.840]   And the group that studied had a gap test,
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.700]   they had a gap test,
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.540]   they perform somewhere in the middle.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.740]   What does this tell us?
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.980]   What it tells us is so important
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.340]   vis-a-vis neuroplasticity,
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.140]   vis-a-vis best learning strategies.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.140]   This is something that,
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.380]   goodness, I wish I had learned
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:19.420]   when I was in graduate school,
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.940]   when I was an undergraduate,
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:23.700]   when I was in high school and elementary school.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.740]   Goodness, even when I was in kindergarten,
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.040]   I wish I had learned this.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.060]   Test yourself on the material
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.340]   that you were just exposed to
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.500]   very soon after your first exposure to it,
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.500]   because that offsets the natural forgetting
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.480]   of new material that the brain is exposed to.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:45.080]   This is absolutely the hallmark
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.360]   of all the impressive data
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.920]   about testing as a tool for learning.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.440]   Testing oneself or your students,
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.980]   or being tested if you're the student by your teacher
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.300]   as a tool, not just for evaluating performance,
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:01.940]   for knowing what you know and don't know,
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.120]   but for consolidating that information
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.700]   in your neural circuits.
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.660]   And when I say consolidating that information
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:09.620]   in your neural circuits,
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.780]   I realize it's a mouthful.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:14.880]   What we know is that this business
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.120]   of putting the testing soon after exposure to new material
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.480]   is about offsetting the forgetting of that material.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.600]   So you might say, "Wait, if that's true,
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.400]   "how come studying the material and then waiting
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.280]   "and then taking two tests right back to back
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.320]   "where you're learning the material again during the test,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.120]   "that should be the best performing group."
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.760]   Ah, well, there seems to be something
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:37.040]   fundamentally different about first exposure to material
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.240]   versus testing yourself on that material.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.180]   And we don't know exactly what that is.
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.600]   There's some interesting neural imaging data in humans
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.800]   that this has to do something with this notion
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.840]   of familiarity with material.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.960]   This is very simple, so this is easy to understand
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.920]   even though it involves a little bit of memory,
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.360]   neuroscience nomenclature.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.680]   Familiarity with something, recognizing it
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.560]   is not the same thing as having agility with that thing,
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.520]   of having mastery of that thing,
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.040]   is not the same thing as having mastery of the material,
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.620]   of having committed it to memory, okay?
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.640]   So when you read something over and over and over,
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.200]   you see it over and over, you hear it over and over,
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.920]   you think about it over and over, of course,
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.280]   you're reading it or you're hearing about it.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.700]   And you think that you're learning the material,
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.960]   that your neural circuits are changing,
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.600]   but it's a pretty passive process
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.920]   or even if it's a difficult chapter to read
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.200]   or a difficult passage of music.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.480]   The difference is when you're tested on material,
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:40.360]   something happens in your performance of or recalling of,
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.680]   if it's just cognitive or you're writing it down
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.620]   or you're told to play the music or do the motor movement,
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.740]   something happens in the error,
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.260]   the getting wrong of certain things
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.640]   that cues your nervous system to lock in the information
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.540]   that you have right and to remember what you have wrong
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.940]   so that you then correct it,
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.820]   which is far and away different
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:05.620]   than exposure and re-exposure and re-exposure, okay?
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.360]   So it's a prerequisite to learning
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.700]   that you need to see the material for the first time,
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.420]   you can't just start testing yourself on material
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.460]   you've never been exposed to.
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.580]   I suppose you could, but you're gonna get it,
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.060]   I would imagine mostly wrong, we're all wrong.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.660]   But this business of using testing
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.640]   very soon after first exposure to material
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.740]   as a tool to study in order to offset forgetting
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.620]   is clearly tapping into this difference
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.980]   between familiarity with something
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:35.820]   for which we know certain brain areas are activated
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:40.340]   versus recollection, being able to take that material
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.260]   and bring it to memory,
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:45.340]   bring it to your focused attention and use that material.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.860]   I realize this is a bit abstract
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.460]   and some of this is still being parsed.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.060]   If you're interested in the neuroscience
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.580]   of familiarity with something
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.180]   versus your ability to actually recall something
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.560]   and have mastery of that material,
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.580]   there's a really nice review
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:01.360]   that I provide a link to in the show note caption,
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.880]   it's published in the journal Hippocampus.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.060]   I always chuckle at the fact that there's a journal
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.500]   that named after a brain structure.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.680]   After all, as far as I know,
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.980]   there isn't a journal called Retina or Amygdala.
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.140]   And I have a brief anecdote from graduate school
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.540]   whereby I learned that there was this journal, Hippocampus,
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.900]   and I was at a grad,
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.540]   it was my first graduate student gathering
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.380]   in graduate school.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.760]   And the guy who hosted it turns out is a luminary
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.920]   in the field of learning and memory.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.780]   And I was saying, you know, this is ridiculous.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.460]   Like there's a journal called Hippocampus
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.460]   and here I am first year graduate student.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.420]   He goes, yeah, there is.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.720]   And I said, yeah, that's something so silly.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.420]   Like who are the idiots that name a journal
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.960]   after a brain structure?
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.100]   Turns out there's also a journal called Cerebral Cortex
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.620]   and there's probably one about spinal cord.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.660]   So it turns out I was the idiot saying this.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.260]   And the guy I was talking to,
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.380]   who of course was the host of the party said,
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.860]   yeah, actually, that's my journal.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.420]   I founded the journal Hippocampus.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:54.820]   So you can look them up.
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.980]   So at this point, you're going to take a test
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.980]   and it's a super easy test, okay?
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.940]   I realized we're a bit into the material
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:04.160]   and we're all probably fatiguing a little bit.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.220]   Marveling, I hope at what an incredible tool testing
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.900]   and in particular self-testing soon after
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.140]   being exposed to new material is.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.860]   And the question is this,
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.220]   and by the way, this is an open-ended question.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.900]   You're not supposed to know the answer
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.500]   'cause I haven't told you the answer yet,
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.260]   but I want you to think about this.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:27.060]   If one looks at the majority of data in this whole field
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.540]   of testing as a studying tool,
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:33.060]   how much improvement do you think you get
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.480]   from testing yourself once on new material?
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.040]   Do you think it's a 10% improvement, a 20% improvement?
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.700]   So here I'm just comparing to testing yourself
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.540]   once on material that you were just exposed to
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.000]   for the first time versus not testing yourself at all, okay?
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.360]   How much do you think you improve?
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:55.800]   The answer is about 50%, five, zero.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.360]   And I can say that on the basis of the fact
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.360]   that in studies of musical learning,
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.340]   of mathematical learning, of language learning,
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:04.660]   of motor learning,
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.580]   when subjects are exposed to new material
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.100]   and then tested at some period of time later,
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.540]   the percentage of information they get right
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:16.980]   or that they are able to perform something correctly
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.840]   diminishes over time,
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.620]   especially because they're not doing any practice
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.840]   and no testing in the intervening time.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.020]   This was built into these experiments.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.260]   And then you simply ask
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.180]   how much of the material was forgotten
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.240]   if they just were exposed to the material.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.040]   So in the case of say music learning,
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:35.880]   this would be, you know,
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.120]   your teacher sits down next to you
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.760]   and shows you the scales on the piano,
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.560]   but then you're not practicing them in between.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.720]   Versus, or perhaps another example would be
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:45.760]   somebody gives you a lecture
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.820]   about a particular phase in history,
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.280]   and then you're not being exposed to the material again,
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.280]   and you're not self-testing.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.040]   Versus if you just take one test,
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.320]   even a self-directed test of the material immediately after,
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.600]   irrespective of how well you perform.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.220]   You have the amount of forgetting.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:05.400]   Okay, I want you to think about self-testing in this way,
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.240]   because we're thinking about optimal studying strategies.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.400]   You have the amount of forgetting that would normally occur.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.620]   This is oh so important.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.960]   In fact, I don't even know that most neuroscientists
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.860]   think about learning and neuroplasticity this way.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:21.920]   Most everybody, including neuroscientists,
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.800]   are taught, were taught, continue to be taught
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.080]   that you're exposed to new material.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.560]   You focus, okay, then during sleep,
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.000]   there's remodeling of the connections.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.680]   All that's true.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.680]   But we really need to think about how most information
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.080]   that comes into our nervous system each day is forgotten.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.700]   Most of it is completely discarded.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.360]   There are some rare clinical deficits
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.320]   where people remember everything.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.180]   And I'll tell you, these people really struggle in life.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:49.800]   They do not do well in work, in relationships.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.240]   They remember every little detail of everything,
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.200]   and it is incredibly disruptive to their quality of life.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.720]   It's nothing you want.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.600]   You want to have a great memory for the right things.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.120]   So when you self-test material,
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.360]   you have the amount of forgetting that occurs
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.960]   compared to if you're just exposed to the material.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.320]   I want you to keep that fact in mind
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.880]   because that fact is the one
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.800]   that really hit me upside the head
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.560]   and made me realize, goodness gracious,
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.560]   how I wish that I'd self-tested myself
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.620]   on material that I wanted to remember over time
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:26.320]   rather than reading it over and over.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.360]   I had this elaborate process for studying
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.120]   that I used all through college and graduate school,
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.480]   and it worked pretty well for me
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.760]   where I'd read and highlight,
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.880]   then I'd write out my notes.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.980]   Then I would write little paragraphs about that stuff.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:39.220]   Now, some of that probably mimicked self-testing.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.360]   Indeed, it had to have.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.880]   And then of course I would take the quizzes
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.480]   and I would go to office hours.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.560]   Once I got serious about school,
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.000]   I got really serious about school.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.520]   And of course I still forget things.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.680]   I've made errors on this podcast before,
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.680]   in part from going too fast or making a joke
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.640]   that people didn't perceive as a joke.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.300]   So the whole story there, but in any case,
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.340]   of course I make errors.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:58.300]   Of course, I've forgotten certain things
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.380]   and sometimes I misspeak.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:01.820]   I always strive to get things accurately.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.860]   We correct things in the show note captions.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.820]   If they're called out to us,
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.640]   we're now using AI to review the podcast
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.580]   and adjust anywhere using insertions
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:12.180]   or actually replacing those words if we need to
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.180]   and so on and so forth.
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.060]   But yes, we all forget things.
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.620]   We all make errors.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:21.620]   But if I had just known that testing myself on material
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.220]   while walking out of class or soon after getting home
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.180]   or later that evening or the next day
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:29.700]   would allow me to perform so much better
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.700]   on an exam, a midterm or a final exam.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.940]   And of course I still would have studied
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.720]   because I was committed and you should still study
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.420]   as much as you feel is necessary
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.780]   to get mastery of the material for you.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.700]   However, if I had known that testing oneself
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.060]   or being tested soon after exposure to material
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.780]   would have the amount of forgetting
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.980]   even out to a year later,
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.260]   I definitely would have saved myself a lot of time.
[01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:55.300]   Let's talk about some specifics of ways
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.660]   that you can self-test or if you're a teacher
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.380]   or if you have good dialogue with your teacher
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.300]   and they are open-minded,
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.820]   perhaps they are open to hearing about
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.900]   what are the best forms of testing oneself
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.400]   as a tool for learning.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:14.820]   The best tests are open-ended, short answer,
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.240]   very minimal prompt tests.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.400]   Not unlike the type that we've taken today
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.080]   during this podcast.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.020]   As compared to multiple choice tests.
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:28.320]   Multiple choice questions allow for familiarity
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.600]   of names, of facts.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.000]   It's going to be A, B, C, D,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.780]   and sometimes E is A and C and so on and so forth.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.040]   And within each of those A, B, C, D, E answers
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.400]   and you're looking for the right answer,
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.980]   you're looking for the familiarity,
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:44.160]   the recognition of something.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.480]   Yes, this, not that.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.320]   Okay, that's the best answer, you circle C, okay?
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.400]   This kind of thing.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.060]   As opposed to an open-ended question
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.600]   where you have to write out your answer,
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.760]   you have to recall the information, right?
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.460]   It requires a much greater degree of mastery
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:01.280]   of the information than does familiarity
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.880]   or recognition of the material.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.160]   So the best tests as study tools
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.180]   are going to be open-ended, short answer questions
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.200]   or even long answer questions.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.400]   Now there's one exception to this,
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.760]   which are multiple choice tests that include tricks.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.720]   Okay, if you've ever taken the GRE,
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.760]   the Graduate School Entrance Exam,
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.700]   or the LSAT, or the MCAT,
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.920]   there are some questions in there
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.360]   that are very straightforward,
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.440]   but in those standardized tests,
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.900]   they tend to include some "trick questions"
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.120]   in which those questions don't allow you
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.020]   to just recognize the correct answer
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.920]   and distinguish it from the other incorrect answers,
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.760]   but rather they have answers in there
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.920]   that on first blush look like the right answer
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.080]   and people have a tendency to circle those and move on
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.220]   or to select those and move on.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:54.160]   But if you think about the material a little more deeply,
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.040]   it turns out those "obvious answers"
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.300]   are actually the incorrect answers.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.000]   So there are versions of multiple choice tests
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.420]   where it requires a greater degree of mastery
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.260]   of the material,
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:08.380]   where simple familiarity won't serve you
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.420]   and you actually have to be able to recall
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.240]   the different components of information
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.580]   leading into that.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.480]   But those are a bit more rare,
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.380]   certainly in the context of other kinds of learning,
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.400]   like musical learning.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.040]   Although I suppose for music theory,
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.360]   that could be relevant.
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.680]   But when I say music learning,
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.640]   I'm just kind of defaulting to the idea
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.240]   of the mechanics of musical learning,
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:29.680]   but of course there's music theory, et cetera.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.120]   So what I'm effectively saying is the ultimate exam,
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.000]   the final exam, the midterm exam,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.400]   the exam that's administered to you,
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.280]   rarely do you have control over the format of that exam.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.040]   Sometimes it's mixed format,
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.400]   but the different ways in which you self-test
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.960]   as a form of studying are really key.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:49.120]   And ideally you would make these open-ended.
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.320]   In other words, you would not simply rely
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.480]   on multiple choice.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.040]   You would rely on a form of self-testing
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.240]   or that you give your students
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.280]   or that your teacher gives you
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.840]   that requires you to think about the material
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.080]   with some degree of depth,
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.240]   with some degree of effort.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.360]   And of course you're going to get certain things wrong.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.400]   Now, I would hope that if testing is being used
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.560]   as a learning tool, as opposed to just for evaluation,
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.880]   but here we're talking about using testing
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.880]   as a learning tool, that it wouldn't impact,
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.400]   at least not at that moment,
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.520]   your final performance in the course or whatever it is.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.000]   Rather, it is testing for sake of learning.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.480]   Now, we know from the literature
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.000]   that students don't like pop quizzes.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.920]   I gave you a few today and forgive me.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.360]   They don't like pop quizzes.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.760]   And we know this in the form of the reduction
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.520]   in teaching evaluation scores, okay?
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.520]   Having received teaching evaluation scores
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   of different, let's say, values over the years.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.560]   And I always take the feedback seriously.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:51.720]   One salient comment that just leapt into my mind
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.240]   was the fact that I ended up mentioning
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.120]   my bulldog Costello too often in class.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.560]   So here I'm mentioning him again,
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.000]   just to get back at that one student
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.160]   that said I mentioned him too much.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.740]   I mentioned him as much as I want.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.200]   The point here is that when students evaluate
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.120]   their teachers, they tend to punish their teachers
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.960]   for pop quizzes.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.840]   Does that mean pop quizzes aren't effective?
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.640]   No, but you know what's more effective?
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.560]   Telling students at the outset of class
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.280]   or telling yourself at the outset
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.360]   of any kind of learning expedition,
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.920]   'cause this isn't just about the classroom,
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.520]   that you're going to take a bunch of exams,
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.440]   that you're going to use testing or quizzes,
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.320]   whatever you want to call them,
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:32.040]   as a form of teaching and learning.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.560]   And that you can expect five tests or five quizzes
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.960]   during the course of being presented the material
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.820]   or that you are going to test yourself
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.040]   every day after the material.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.680]   Now, sometimes you have to go from one class
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:43.520]   to the next class.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.000]   There isn't an opportunity to test yourself,
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.920]   but guess what's not going to be helpful?
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.460]   Walking out of class and getting immediately
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.760]   onto your phone.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.920]   We know that that probably inhibits your ability
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.200]   to remember the material
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.040]   because it's going to enhance forgetting
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.880]   because you do have this key opportunity
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.240]   right after being exposed to new material
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.960]   to help offset the forgetting
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.720]   by testing yourself on that material
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.540]   as soon as possible after being exposed to it.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.960]   So again, even though I did not attend school
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.000]   in an era where we had smartphones and texting,
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.640]   I recall walking out of class
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.540]   and just walking out of class and going on my bicycle.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.640]   But of course there were people to talk to,
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.320]   there were other things to attend to.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.760]   If you're really serious about learning material,
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.880]   take a few seconds, maybe even a few minutes
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:29.280]   after being exposed to that material
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.560]   and think about that material, test yourself on it.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.240]   And if you find that you don't know the material,
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.200]   you're confused by it or overwhelmed by it, great.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.020]   You just accomplished the first step
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.880]   in cuing your nervous system to the fact
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.960]   that it needs to learn that material
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.760]   and you've created an opportunity
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.560]   for enhanced neuroplasticity,
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.320]   which is really what all of this stuff
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.280]   about testing as a form of studying is about.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.640]   You're going to test yourself
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.040]   so that you figure out what you don't know
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.880]   so that you then look up that material,
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.600]   test yourself on it again,
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:03.600]   so that ultimately you forget very little of it, if any.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.880]   Now, there are other components
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.200]   to learning a neuroplasticity
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.840]   that I've talked about on previous podcasts
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.440]   that are just too interesting not to mention,
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.000]   but I'm just going to mention them in brief,
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.040]   things like gap effects.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.520]   Gap effects are oh so cool
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.560]   and they've been demonstrated
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.280]   for lots of different forms of learning.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.800]   Gap effects are what I just did,
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.640]   which is to take periodic pauses
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:27.100]   in the learning of material as short as five to 10 seconds,
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.640]   but even as long as 30 seconds,
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.200]   during which, guess what?
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.220]   Your hippocampus, the neurons in your hippocampus
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.540]   repeat information that you've been exposed to
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:40.160]   for the first time at a rate 20 to 30 times faster
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.160]   than typical, just as it does
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.820]   during rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:48.560]   So if you are a teacher and/or if you are a learner,
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:53.140]   periodically throughout an episode, a class,
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:55.180]   or whatever of trying to learn new motor skills
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.440]   or music skills or whatever kind of learning,
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:01.360]   pause and let your hippocampus
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.680]   generate more repetitions of that material
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.340]   than it would otherwise if you just tried to barrel through.
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.780]   So I realize as we've gone through today's discussion
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:11.140]   that words like test and quiz,
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:13.700]   evaluation, offsetting, forgetting,
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:16.800]   all of that stuff can spike people's cortisol.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.800]   It can give us flashbacks
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.960]   to uncomfortable classroom experiences
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.120]   related to being called on, cold called for the answer,
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.740]   a vicious trick that instructors play.
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:30.480]   Keep in mind that testing as a form of studying,
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.080]   whether or not self-directed or given to you by a teacher
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.920]   is not for sake of evaluation at the level of,
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:41.920]   okay, you get an exam at the end of a lecture
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.320]   and then you do your best to answer those questions
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.160]   and then you turn it in and it impacts your grade.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:52.000]   No, this is about being told or revealing to yourself
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.840]   how much you know and don't know.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.560]   And then of course being told the correct answer
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.360]   so that you can compare your answers to the correct answers
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.100]   and doing this frequently and ideally very soon
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:02.580]   after being exposed to the material.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.360]   That's one of the key things
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.660]   that I keep coming back to again and again here
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.280]   because it's something that frankly was not done
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.400]   while I was in school for whatever reason.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.700]   And I think that's largely
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:17.260]   because when people hear the word testing,
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.680]   they think of evaluation and if anything,
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.380]   at least in the United States over the last 30 years,
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.780]   but in particular over the last 15 years,
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.580]   there's been this tendency to shift away
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.540]   from formal evaluation.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.780]   I personally believe that one can learn
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.700]   in many different styles and many different contexts.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.340]   I, of course, as a university professor
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.380]   believe that for certain topics,
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.300]   in particular science and medicine and health,
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.180]   but other topics as well, of course,
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:44.260]   that formal rigorous coursework
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:47.120]   is by far the best way to learn information for me.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.980]   But that regardless of whether or not you're learning
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.540]   just from YouTube or you're learning from podcasts
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.380]   or you're learning from books
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:57.700]   or you're learning from the school of life, as it were,
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:01.660]   from experience, that testing as a form of studying
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:03.320]   is absolutely key.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.340]   And gosh, there's such a beautiful body of research.
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:07.740]   In fact, I'll link to several studies,
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:10.280]   including a review entitled Testing Enhances Learning,
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.320]   a review of the literature,
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.240]   as well as a beautiful article, Test Enhanced Learning,
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.320]   which gets into this.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.000]   And there's a wonderful book about this
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.840]   that I'll also provide a link to in the show note captions.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.600]   All of course, authored by researchers
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.180]   who have worked squarely in this field
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.800]   and compare the data on testing as a studying tool
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.560]   to other forms of studying and learning.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.140]   So it's a really impressive literature
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:36.840]   that I do believe we all should have known about.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.680]   And that's why I'm passing it on to you now.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.880]   Now, before we wrap up,
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.240]   I want to make sure that I emphasize
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.240]   some of the other key components to studying and learning
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.400]   that have nothing to do with testing as a studying tool.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.200]   And those are the role of emotion,
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.460]   the role of story,
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:58.760]   and the role of what's called interleaving.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   Now, in terms of emotion,
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   I think we all inherently understand
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.860]   that more emotionally laden experiences
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.600]   are remembered more durably.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.720]   We tend not to forget them.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.920]   In fact, this is the basis of things like PTSD,
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.640]   post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.060]   It is the reality that one trial learning
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.960]   that is exposure to something and never forgetting it
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.700]   occurs very readily
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:24.680]   when the thing that we're exposed to is negative
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.720]   or has a very heavy negative emotional salience.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.560]   So it could be something we read or something we see.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.960]   Sometimes it's something that happens to us.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.280]   You know, I don't like the idea of that, but this is true.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.480]   Your nervous system is wired such,
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.480]   neuroplasticity is such that stressful experiences,
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.080]   because they deploy such massive amounts
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.560]   of adrenaline epinephrine,
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.280]   as well as other neuromodulators,
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:55.480]   allow very quickly for the milieu,
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.440]   the environment of the neural circuits
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.480]   that led up to that experience
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.980]   to strengthen their connections with one trial,
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.600]   so-called one trial learning.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.800]   This is why, sadly,
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.440]   although at the same time, from an adaptive perspective,
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:13.040]   we say, fortunately, if you were to step outside today
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.960]   and God forbid, see somebody get hit by a car,
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.120]   you would remember that.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.260]   Chances are you would remember that forever.
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.860]   Now, that does not mean that the emotional components
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:27.400]   of that memory are necessarily going to stay within you.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.440]   There are tools for the treatment of PTSD,
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.880]   such as the different ones that come to mind
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.160]   are, you know, systematic exposure therapy,
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:40.940]   where you're re-exposed to that idea or memory,
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.580]   sometimes even circumstance,
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:46.120]   with, of course, the support of a trained professional,
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.000]   typically a psychiatrist or psychologist.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.520]   And the emotional load of that experience
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.040]   is gradually uncoupled from your memory of the experience.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.740]   There's things like EMDR.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.480]   There are pharmacologic approaches.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.420]   Some of these are combined
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.940]   with the sorts of things I've described.
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:03.440]   I've done entire episodes about stress and PTSD.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.160]   Again, you can find those at hubermanlab.com
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.740]   by putting stress PTSD into the search function.
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:14.160]   However, we know that it is the same neuromodulators,
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.000]   mainly epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.360]   deployed at massive amounts in those moments
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.200]   where something very stressful happens
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.660]   that allows the neural circuits
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.180]   that led up to the circumstance,
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:26.120]   as well as the neural circuits that encoded
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.980]   that visual scene and scenes like it, or sounds like it,
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:33.240]   to be locked in and linked to the stress response.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.600]   Now, what this is really all saying
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.520]   is that negative stuff is remembered
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.940]   typically the first time and every time,
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.120]   and very durably over time.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.760]   As compared to positive experiences,
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.560]   which as far as peak experiences go, right,
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.000]   birth of your first child, a wedding,
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.880]   a wonderful professional or personal experience,
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.120]   those two can be one trial learning and memory.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.860]   But most things that we are exposed to
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:03.940]   are not at those extremes, either negative or positive.
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:07.740]   However, we know that any kind of story,
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:10.860]   any kind of emotional emphasis on material,
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.900]   either in the delivery of that material,
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:15.780]   but certainly in the way that that material
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.060]   is perceived by you,
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.340]   like getting really excited
[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:19.720]   about something you want to learn,
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.860]   or thinking something's really awful,
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:24.220]   is likely to be more readily
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:26.500]   and stably committed to your memory.
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.460]   And that's because of these neuromodulators
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:30.020]   like epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.060]   but other neuromodulators as well,
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.960]   that wire those experiences into your neural circuits.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.460]   Again, these neuromodulators, epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:40.420]   we also hear about acetylcholine, dopamine, et cetera,
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.980]   they can operate at low levels
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:45.500]   and sort of background levels.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.900]   They can create subtle fluctuations
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.420]   in mood, focus, and attention,
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.420]   or they can create massive shifts
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.660]   in mood, focus, and attention,
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:54.260]   depending on their levels, their timing,
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:55.780]   and much, much more.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:58.240]   The point here is that if you're a teacher
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.160]   and/or if you are a learner,
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.980]   paying attention to your internal state
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.340]   as you're trying to learn is very key.
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.900]   We've all had that teacher,
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.040]   that lecture that just kind of drones things out
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:09.880]   and monotone.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.300]   If you need to learn the material
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:14.340]   coming out of a source like that, person or otherwise,
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.540]   you're going to have to ramp up
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.980]   your level of internal attention consciously
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.740]   in order to bring about some emotional salience,
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:23.940]   some intensity to the way it's perceived.
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:27.020]   And you can do that just through your own thinking,
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:29.060]   as opposed to the situation
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.900]   where you have a super dynamic teacher
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:32.600]   who's telling you things with wide eyes
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.040]   and perhaps even cracking jokes.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.480]   By the way, the teachers that crack jokes
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.800]   get lower teacher evaluations
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.920]   than those that don't crack jokes or swear.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.760]   Didn't you know that?
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.640]   Teachers that crack jokes and swear,
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:43.920]   they're perceived as more likable,
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.560]   but they get lower overall evaluations typically.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.120]   They're seen as less professional
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:51.660]   and therefore less good teachers by their students.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:53.600]   So I try not to make too many jokes
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.160]   or swear in my lectures.
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.120]   The point being that we all have
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.080]   those really wonderful dynamic teachers.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.480]   Yes, it's much easier to learn and remember that material.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.000]   You still need to test yourself on it,
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.080]   but it's much easier to learn that material
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.420]   for the very reasons I stated before.
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:13.240]   It's a lesser example of more deployment
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:15.840]   of the neuromodulators in you, the learner,
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.240]   that is exposed to that material, okay?
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.880]   So emotion matters.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.240]   So much so that in a beautiful review
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.720]   about learning and memory from the great James McGaugh,
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.800]   one of the luminaries in modern neuroscience
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.520]   and psychology of memory,
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.560]   he talked about a medieval practice, this is pre-wild,
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:35.820]   whereby people and kids, kids are people of course,
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.680]   but adults and kids were taught information
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.180]   and then thrown, literally thrown into cold water.
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:44.020]   Why?
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:46.560]   To deploy adrenaline and consolidate memory
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.460]   of the material they were exposed to.
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.160]   Now, I know we've covered deliberate cold exposure
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.880]   on this podcast before.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.920]   No, I'm not saying you need to do a cold plunge
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:57.860]   after being exposed to new material, but guess what?
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:59.840]   They were doing that many hundreds of years ago
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.140]   and it makes sense logically based on all our understanding
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.320]   of the neurobiology underlying things like PTSD,
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:11.240]   underlying emotion-laden memory formation and consolidation
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.720]   and our ability to remember things
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.000]   that were emotionally laden,
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.680]   much better than things that were less emotionally laden.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.900]   So if you want to take a cold shower
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:21.140]   after learning some material
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:25.080]   or even better testing yourself mentally on that material
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.960]   while in a cold shower or cold plunge, you certainly can.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:31.120]   Just don't stay in there too long, use best practices.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.880]   If you want to know what those best practices are
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.680]   for deliberate cold exposure,
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.880]   you can check out our deliberate cold exposure newsletter
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.360]   at hubermanlab.com, it's completely zero cost.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.340]   You don't even need to sign up.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:42.200]   You simply go to newsletter in the menu tab
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.600]   and you can find that PDF.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.520]   And now because you are becoming proficient
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.560]   in an understanding of neuroplasticity and learning
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.960]   and testing and neuromodulators like epinephrine,
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.540]   yes, drinking caffeine will increase your levels
[01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:56.860]   of epinephrine, not strikingly so,
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.180]   but enough that it probably helps you learn things
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.020]   a little bit better.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.280]   Should you drink the coffee after?
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.640]   Listen, that's getting a little bit too down in the details.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.640]   The most important components to learning
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.340]   are that you be alert so that you can attend,
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.400]   so you can pay attention to the material
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.740]   you're trying to learn and then testing yourself later.
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:16.000]   And of course the other component,
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.660]   which is getting sufficient amounts
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.340]   of great sleep each night.
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:22.020]   And I highly recommend doing NSDR.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.980]   I mentioned gap effects before.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:25.340]   Those are very, very cool.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.040]   I just used another one now.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.440]   And the final tool for studying
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.380]   that I believe is not discussed enough
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:33.660]   and is a bit counterintuitive.
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.660]   So it's a fun one to just mention.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:37.140]   And that perhaps you can explore
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:39.580]   in your own studying and learning adventures
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.580]   is interleaving of information.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:43.920]   This one's kind of wild actually.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:48.840]   Turns out that if your instructor or you
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.860]   takes information about something
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:51.700]   that they're trying to teach you
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.060]   or you're trying to learn,
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.420]   maybe it's piano, maybe it's neuroscience,
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.140]   maybe it's how to learn better.
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.100]   And every once in a while
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.780]   throws in a little anecdote about something.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:05.780]   Let's just say, or mention something about the Olympics
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:09.740]   or incorporate something that seems pseudo random
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:11.460]   because it's not actually related
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:13.580]   to the material you're trying to learn.
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:16.300]   Turns out that that acts not as a gap
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.700]   in the same sense that gap effects,
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:20.420]   which are times in which you do nothing
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:22.060]   in order to get more repetitions
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.980]   of the material that you just heard in your hippocampus,
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:28.580]   but rather those breaks of interleaving information,
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.360]   not just getting a steady barrage,
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.620]   like drinking from a fire hose of new information
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.220]   from start to finish,
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:37.100]   turn out to enhance overall learning ability.
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:41.220]   Probably we think at a mechanistic level
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:42.660]   because the neural circuits
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:44.220]   are able to generate more repetition,
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:45.880]   similar to gap effects.
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.300]   But actually in a very interesting way,
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:53.300]   also because by injecting other information
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:58.120]   that seems totally unrelated, random or pseudo random,
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.540]   it allows the brain areas
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.300]   that are responsible for encoding information
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:04.740]   to take whatever new information you're learning
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.380]   and to incorporate it with existing knowledge
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.300]   or even distantly related knowledge.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.580]   So does this mean that you should learn math
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:12.900]   and history in the same lecture?
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.660]   Well, I think that might be a bit overwhelming,
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:16.240]   kind of like drinking from two fire hoses.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.320]   Here we're talking about interleaving,
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.960]   challenging information that's new to you
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.120]   with little anecdotes,
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.320]   little bits of information that perhaps are new to you,
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.200]   but don't require a lot of challenge,
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.720]   which is of course why every once in a while
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:31.240]   I throw in a little anecdote about my bulldog
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.760]   or learning neuroanatomy or something of that sort.
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.220]   It's not just to provide a break,
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:38.800]   it's to provide examples that are related,
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.240]   but not central to the material
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.880]   that we've been talking about today,
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:45.760]   which is all about how to study and learn optimally.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.160]   Okay, so I realize that many of you
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.840]   are not students any longer,
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.240]   although some of you are,
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.400]   but in many ways, we are all students.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.280]   We are all constantly being exposed
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.980]   to all sorts of information out in the world.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:01.360]   And goodness knows, thank goodness we don't remember it all,
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.020]   but there is of course information
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:04.540]   that we would like to remember,
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:08.140]   that we would really like to consolidate in our memory
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:10.340]   and be able to have some mastery over.
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:11.760]   Earlier I said I would distinguish
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:14.060]   between unskilled, skilled, mastery, and virtuosity,
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.360]   and I'll do that now.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.100]   Unskilled of course means that we have limited understanding
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:20.800]   let alone ability to use information.
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:23.300]   Skilled typically means we know and can recognize
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:27.880]   and use information in basic ways or even advanced ways.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.580]   Mastery typically means that we have, you know,
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:33.260]   close to the full depth of knowledge in a given area
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:35.480]   and that we can use it pretty flexibly.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.560]   And virtuosity, at least my definition of virtuosity,
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:42.760]   is where we actually have such mastery of material
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.920]   that we can use it in ways
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.040]   that we still don't even know how we can use,
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.320]   meaning that we can inject elements
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:53.160]   or we even invite elements of uncertainty
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.560]   and kind of spontaneity into the use of that material.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.180]   Here I'm thinking of great musicians,
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:36:58.440]   I'm thinking of great athletes
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.840]   where they know all the plays, they know all the moves,
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.440]   it's all scripted into their nervous system
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.960]   and they can deploy those at any time
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.400]   so they have real mastery.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:10.280]   But in order to display their incredible abilities,
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.520]   their virtuosity, they actively invite in the X factor,
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.320]   the uncertainty such that sometimes they find themselves
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.320]   playing their instrument or singing
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.160]   or performing athletically or mathematically
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.960]   or what have you in ways that even surprise them.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.840]   And that of course is a lot to expect of ourselves.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:32.840]   I think most of us would be content to have skill
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:35.000]   and mastery of the things that we care about
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.680]   and should we achieve virtuosity, then wonderful.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.720]   But one of the main points of today's discussion
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.680]   was to arm you with an understanding of neuroplasticity
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:45.720]   in the context of studying and learning,
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.320]   to really understand that so much of learning
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.640]   stably and consolidating information over time
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:53.760]   is to offset the forgetting process.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.860]   And that testing is not just a tool
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.320]   for evaluating our knowledge,
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.440]   but rather a tool for evaluating
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.400]   and reinforcing and building our knowledge.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.760]   Put differently, that testing is an excellent tool,
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.760]   if not the best tool for studying.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.560]   And I think that's an important reframe
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.040]   that others have brought about
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.480]   and that I really want to highlight, underline
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:17.320]   and boldface during today's discussion.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.180]   It's one that I certainly wish I had applied more
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.720]   in my educational trajectory.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.260]   And it's one that I plan to deploy further
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:27.160]   in my seeking out of new knowledge
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.160]   in terms of the podcast and neuroscience,
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.160]   but in other areas of my life as well.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.960]   Because from the existing literature
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.840]   and hopefully from the way it was presented to you today,
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.520]   you probably realize that it is near infinite,
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:43.120]   if not infinite, that we can apply testing
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.340]   as a tool for studying, self-testing, testing of others,
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.840]   using testing as a way to really probe
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.960]   what we know and don't know
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:52.080]   and to really offset that forgetting process.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.600]   And in that sense, it is really nicely aligned
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:58.120]   with what we know about neuroplasticity.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.200]   And it's also something that we can use freely
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.220]   and that you can use covertly,
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:05.720]   that you can apply in your own seeking out
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:08.320]   of knowledge and new skills of all kinds,
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.240]   classroom or otherwise.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.740]   If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,

[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.860]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:36.800]   or guests or topics that you'd like me to consider
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.320]   for the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.720]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.460]   I do read all the comments.
[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:43.600]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.800]   I have a new book coming out.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.400]   It's my very first book.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.820]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:49.960]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.140]   This is a book that I've been working on
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.280]   for more than five years,
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.620]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.160]   of research and experience.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.240]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.720]   to exercise, to stress control,
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.200]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:07.560]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.620]   for the protocols that are included.
[01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:13.520]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.880]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.640]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.440]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.260]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:24.440]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:27.140]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:30.000]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.600]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.300]   And on all those platforms,
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.280]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.840]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.160]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.360]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.680]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:44.840]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.020]   If you haven't already subscribed
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.520]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:48.880]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.460]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter that has protocols,
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:54.680]   which are one- to three-page PDFs
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.780]   that describe things like optimizing your sleep,
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:00.540]   how to optimize your dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.420]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.740]   that describes resistance training, sets and reps,
[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:06.940]   and all of that, as well as cardiovascular training
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:09.100]   that's supported by the scientific research.
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.460]   And we have protocols related
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:13.020]   to neuroplasticity and learning.
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:15.200]   Again, you can find all that at completely zero cost
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.880]   by going to HubermanLab.com.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.980]   Go to the Menu tab in the right corner,
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:20.400]   scroll down to Newsletter.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.320]   You put in your email,
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.400]   and we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.920]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.280]   all about how to study and learn.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.660]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:33.780]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:36.360]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.940]   (upbeat music)
