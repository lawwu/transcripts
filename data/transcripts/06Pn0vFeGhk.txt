[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   We come this evening to a consideration of the words to be found in the epistle to the
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.800]   Romans in chapter 6 and verse 19. The 19th verse in the 6th chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.600]   to the Romans. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:35.360]   for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity, unto iniquity,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.760]   even so now yield your members servants to righteousness and to holiness.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:54.320]   Now we all, I take it, remember that I was suggesting last Friday evening that this
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:03.720]   verse corresponds in many respects to verses 12 and 13 in this 6th chapter of Paul's
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.400]   epistle to the Romans. The apostle rarely is doing the same thing in a sense twice over
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.400]   in this chapter, but he is doing it in a slightly different manner. His first argument, you
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.560]   remember, ran from verse 1 to 14, and the second argument runs from verse 15 to the
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.240]   end of the chapter. And I was indicating last week that in many ways verse 18 corresponds
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:37.440]   to verse 11, and in exactly the same way this 19th verse corresponds to verses 12 and 13.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.280]   In other words, his method is this. He lays down a doctrine, and then he makes an appeal
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.080]   on the basis of that doctrine. Having stated in verse 11, "Likewise reckon ye yourselves
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.200]   also to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord,"
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.320]   he makes the appeal, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.400]   obey it in the lusts thereof," etc. And having told us in verse 18, "Being then
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness." Because of that, he now
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.960]   goes on to make this exhortation and appeal that is to be found in this 19th verse. And
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.080]   then he will support it by additional arguments in verses 20 to 23.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.880]   Well now, as we come to this verse, we are struck at once, of course, by this preliminary
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.120]   statement which the apostle makes before he proceeds to address his appeal, or to make
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.520]   his exhortation to these Roman Christians. He does something which is rather unusual
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   here. He says, "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh."
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.680]   Now what is he referring to there? Well, he is referring to the way in which he has been
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.840]   using an illustration or an analogy. You remember he began to do that in verse 16. "Know ye
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.560]   not," he says, "that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.080]   ye are to whom ye obey." Now there he has been beginning to use an illustration from
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:36.040]   the realm of slavery, and he has kept it up. Because we saw last week in verse 18, he says,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:45.360]   "Being then made free from sin, ye became enslaved to righteousness," or "ye became
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.840]   the slaves of righteousness." So he is still continuing this same illustration, and indeed
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.240]   when he comes to his practical exhortation, he goes on using it. He says, "For as ye
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:08.920]   have yielded or presented your members slaves to uncleanness, even so now present your members
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:17.360]   slaves to righteousness and to holiness." He is continuing, in other words, with this
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.200]   illustration of his from the world and the realm of slavery. And what he refers to in
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:33.240]   this extraordinary phrase is his own use of this illustration. He says, "I speak after
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.520]   the manner of men." Now that means not that he was speaking as a man or using a human
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.000]   language because he couldn't speak in any other way. He was a man, and he can only speak
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.640]   in human terms and in human language. What he means by "after the manner of men" is
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:00.760]   that he is using a familiar illustration from ordinary life. He isn't referring to the
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.600]   terminology, to the words as such, but to the fact that he has indeed been using an
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.720]   illustration at all. That's what he's saying. Well now then, why does he say this? Why does
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:24.000]   he use this particular terminology here? Why does he call attention to what he's doing?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.600]   Why didn't he just go on with his illustration? Why does he turn aside to make a comment on
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.160]   his own procedure? Now this is an extremely interesting point. It is, as I say, something
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.480]   rather unusual with the apostle, therefore we must look into it. Now there are some who
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:50.840]   have thought that the apostle here was apologizing for using an illustration, that he feels that
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.080]   there is a sense in which a preacher of the gospel shouldn't use an illustration at all,
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.400]   or that he was apologizing for the particular illustration that he used. It seems to me
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:11.200]   that that is an entirely false explanation of what the apostle is here doing, as I hope
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.480]   to show you. There's nothing to apologize for at all. It isn't that he's temporarily
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.200]   forgotten himself and has been speaking after the manner of men in this way. There's no
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.840]   apology here. Well, what is it? Well, it's something much more significant and much more
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:37.880]   important. The apostle is explaining why he used the illustration. Not apologizing for
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.800]   it, but explaining why he did it. And there, of course, is something that really is interesting
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:52.180]   and important at one and the same time. So here is a matter that is of great significance
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:07:01.460]   and of importance as regards teaching methods. It's very important for all preachers in particular,
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:07.640]   but it's important for anybody, whoever uses an illustration or a figure in an attempt
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.400]   to elucidate and to make plain the truth of the Scriptures.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:22.360]   Now then, let us try to see the reasons why the apostle has used his illustration about
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:32.120]   slavery. He tells us why he used it and the explanation of his having done so. The first
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:43.600]   thing is this. He has used his illustration in order to make the subject matter clear.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.240]   That's obviously the first meaning of this phrase. He says, "I speak. I'm speaking to
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.040]   you after the manner of men in this way by using this illustration from the familiar
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.500]   effect of slavery." And of course, they were very familiar with slavery in those days.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:04.840]   He says, "Now, I'm doing this because I'm so anxious to make my point plain and clear
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:16.960]   to you." Now, there is a very important point. That, I wouldn't hesitate to assert, is always
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:27.820]   the only reason for using an illustration. It's the only reason for ever using an illustration.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:34.300]   A man should never use an illustration merely to tell a good story or to bring out a rather
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:40.620]   clever illustration. Is there any need to say that, Sir someone? I suggest there is
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:47.180]   a great need to say it. Because the use of stories and of illustrations always makes
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:56.680]   an appeal to the flesh. People always like that sort of thing. Congregations generally
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.540]   like preachers to talk about themselves and to tell stories about themselves and to illustrate
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:08.220]   things out of their own lives. It's always liked, and people like a story and people
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:16.060]   like an illustration. And it can be a very real snare. But it seems to me that the Apostle
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.900]   is teaching us here that there is only one way of justifying the use of an illustration
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:31.740]   and a story, and that is to make the meaning plain and clear. You notice that so far in
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.940]   this epistle, the Apostle has not done this at all before. This is the first time he does
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:44.460]   it. The Apostle Paul does not tell stories. He does not throw illustrations about. He
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:51.540]   does so here, but he seems to feel the need of explaining why he has done so. Not apologizing,
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:10:02.060]   I say, but giving an explanation. Now, the business of preaching or of teaching
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:09.820]   is always to make the meaning and the matter plain and clear. Always. That is a canon from
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:16.700]   which I imagine no one would dissent. It is the business of any exposition to make the
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:23.660]   meaning plain and clear. Holding that in our minds, it seems to me, therefore, that there
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:30.220]   are two extremes that we have always got to avoid, two dangers, if you like, that we must
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:40.020]   always avoid. One is the danger of being childish. And this, I think, is a very real danger today,
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:46.660]   if I may say so with temerity, in evangelical circles. The great word is the word "simple."
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:52.320]   "Oh, so marvelously simple," they say. Well, to be simple, of course, is right as
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.740]   long as we mean by that that the meaning is plain and clear. But we should never be childish,
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:03.180]   and we should never treat people as children, as such. And if we merely tell them stories
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:10.700]   and spoon-feed them, we are really treating them as children.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:17.580]   Do we realize the significance of this? Let me do what the apostle does at this very point,
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:25.940]   and I do it solely to make this thing quite clear. I remember preaching on one occasion,
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:33.220]   and a man said to me at the end, he said, "You know, you only gave us one illustration
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:39.300]   this evening." The last time, he said, "I remember there were several." Well, now,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:45.820]   I immediately examined that man. The man was a bit of a poet, and I had no doubt at all
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:52.300]   in my own mind that that man was really only interested in the stories and illustrations
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:59.180]   in a sermon. That was the sort of thing that appealed to him. And there is no doubt that
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:05.620]   this did become a very real danger in the Christian church, and still is up to a point,
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:13.140]   that we are just entertaining by means of stories and pictures and analogies and illustrations.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.380]   We must never do that. But then there's the other danger at the other extreme, which
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.300]   I do not think is the danger today, but I think was very definitely the danger in the
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:33.620]   last century, and particularly in certain circles. I'm thinking, for instance, of
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:41.460]   what is said to be a perfectly true story of people going out of a service in Edinburgh
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:49.100]   one Sunday morning, when the great preacher, the great pulpitier, which they had last century,
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:56.340]   you remember, had been delivering this tremendous sermon. And they were walking out, and the
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:03.940]   poor woman was walking out amongst others. And somebody turned to her and said, "Well,
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.740]   did you enjoy the service?" And she said, "Yes, it was wonderful." "Well," said
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:16.220]   this man, "were you able to follow the argument?" And she said, "Far be it from
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:22.100]   me to presume to be able to follow and to understand the mind of such a great preacher."
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:29.420]   Well, now, there it is. You see, there's the other extreme. And undoubtedly, that was
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.820]   the position in the Victorian period, and I'm mentioning it for this reason only. I
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.060]   am convinced that that is one of the main explanations of the state of the Christian
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:47.540]   church today. These great preachers, who went into the pulpit with their academic sermons,
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.580]   which they generally read, and the great bulk of the congregation had no idea as to what
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.940]   they were talking about. "But why did they go?" you say. "Ah, well, somehow or other,
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.180]   you see, they were given the feeling that it was rather wonderful to be listening to
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.060]   this which was so great that they couldn't understand it, forgetting that the business
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:12.980]   of a preacher and of a sermon, as I'm emphasizing, is to make the meaning plain. I'm using this
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.740]   analogy," says the apostle, "in order that you may understand what I'm talking about,
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:27.020]   what I'm saying." And it is the only reason for using an illustration or an analogy. They
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:33.620]   must never be used to entertain or to bring a kind of glory to the men who have told a
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:42.100]   good story. And of course, the very depth of this point, this matter, is reached when
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.940]   you hear of men even keeping notebooks, and if they hear a tale or a story, putting it
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:53.540]   down in the notebook so that they can bring it out. And thus, congregations are amused
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:15:01.300]   and entertained by stories and illustrations for the sake of stories and of illustrations.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:07.460]   The great apostle never did that. He is not defending that. He is saying that the only
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:14.060]   reason, and I must repeat it, for using such an analogy is that it does help to make the
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.380]   meaning plain and clear.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:25.300]   But let us go on to a second matter. The second point is this. He uses his analogy because
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:35.740]   he is anxious to avoid and to prevent a serious misunderstanding of what he is saying. Not
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.980]   only does he want to make it plain and clear, he realizes that there is the possibility
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:47.460]   of a serious misunderstanding of what he is saying. Or, if I may use a scriptural phrase,
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:53.380]   he was afraid that they might wrest the truth unto their own destruction. Now, that is from
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:59.380]   the apostle Peter, you remember, in the second epistle and in the third chapter towards the
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:05.220]   end. He talks about these writings of his beloved brother Paul, in which he says, "There
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.580]   are some things which are hard to be understood, which the unlearned and the unstable wrest
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:16.380]   as they do also the other scriptures to their own destruction."
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:22.780]   Now the apostle realized, therefore, that there was a danger of what he was saying at
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:30.300]   this point being misunderstood. So he takes up this analogy of slavery in order to put
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:35.420]   the point plain and clear. Now, what is he safeguarding? I think he is safeguarding this.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:43.420]   He has said in verse 14, "For sin shall not have dominion over you, because you are
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:49.220]   not under the law, but under grace." Ah, that is a dangerous thing to say. You are
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:55.700]   not under the law. Now then, the apostle was so afraid that some of these people might
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.500]   say, "Oh, very well, we are not under the law. We needn't be bothered about our conduct
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.660]   and behavior any longer. We need have no concern, now then, about righteousness. We are free.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:10.260]   We are absolutely free. We were slaves. We are now free." "Wait a minute," says
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:22.460]   Paul, "you are not. You are now slaves to righteousness. You are enslaved to righteousness."
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:28.620]   He has just been saying that at the end of verse 18. In other words, he wants them to
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:36.860]   see that the man who is no longer under the law is now under law to Christ. He is not
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:44.460]   free from righteousness. No, no, he is free to righteousness. He is set free to the practice
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:51.380]   of righteousness. And he is so anxious that nobody should imagine that not being under
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.940]   the law means that you are absolutely free. He says, "No, no, you are no longer slaves
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:02.900]   to sin, but you are slaves to righteousness." Now he says, "I put it like that. In terms
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.840]   of this analogy of slavery and of a man being a slave of one master, and then another coming
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.620]   and buying him out of that, and delivering him from that, and making him his own slave,
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:18.440]   I put it like that," says Paul, "in order that nobody might rest my statement about
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:27.540]   being no longer under the law to his own destruction." That's why he used the analogy. He saw that
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.780]   he must put it so plainly and clearly that nobody could be in any kind of misapprehension
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.460]   or uncertainty with regard to his teaching.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:45.480]   And then I go on to a third reason for his use of the analogy. At least I am concerned
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:54.580]   at this moment with his explanation of why he did use it, and why he calls attention
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:03.220]   to his use of it. And that is the limits of an illustration. Don't you detect that in
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:10.300]   this statement of his? He says, "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.740]   of your flesh." In other words, he says, "Now, don't be mistaken about this. There
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.100]   are limits to an illustration. An illustration is of value. It does help to make the meaning
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:26.900]   plain and clear. It does help to safeguard us against misinterpretation. But," he says,
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:35.020]   "after all, I'm descending, as it were, in using an illustration and an analogy, because
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:44.900]   no illustration is perfect. And no illustration must be pressed too exactly." He's saying
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:54.420]   that to us. He's saying, "I've used an analogy, yes, but don't now press this absolutely,
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.820]   otherwise you'll have the truth in its wrong proportions."
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:07.100]   There is a kind of slavery in the Christian life, but it isn't like that old slavery.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:14.820]   The form of slavery is no longer identical with the other. Therefore, says the apostle,
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:22.100]   "When I've just used this term about your being enslaved to righteousness, well, don't
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:27.100]   be mechanical in your interpretation. Don't say that this slavery is identical in every
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:33.780]   respect to the other slavery, for it isn't. There is a difference. There is a similarity,
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:42.860]   and yet there is a difference. What is it? It's this. Under sin, the slavery was the
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:51.900]   slavery of the compulsion of what we may call the strongman armed. You remember our Lord's
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:59.260]   words? He says, "The strongman armed keepeth his goods at peace." That's a picture of
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:06.580]   mankind in sin, under the tyranny and the dominion and the rule and the sovereignty
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:16.780]   of the devil and of evil. The strongman armed keepeth his goods at peace. It's a tyranny.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:24.060]   It's a totalitarian tyranny of the worst type. That's it. That's the one form of slavery.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:32.940]   There is no freedom there at all. But this other, he says, which I have called being
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:43.100]   enslaved to righteousness, or slaves to God and to Christ, this is different. And this
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:49.180]   is where every analogy breaks down. He says, "My analogy doesn't take me far enough now.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.780]   I've had to put it in this form in order to make it clear to you and to safeguard the
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:22:00.620]   truth, but now it isn't adequate. Let me therefore show you what I mean," he seems to say.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:06.500]   There is something very wonderful about our relationship to righteousness, and it's this,
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:15.300]   that it at one and the same time combines the elements of slavery and freedom. In this
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:20.980]   there is a kind of compulsion, yes, but it isn't the same compulsion as before. A man
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:26.100]   who is a Christian is in a sense a slave, yes, but he isn't a slave in the sense that
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:33.060]   he was before. In what's the difference? It's this. He is now a slave to love. The element
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:42.180]   of love comes in, and it changes the whole position. Now is this clear? A man who is
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:49.620]   in love, of course, is a slave. He is absolutely lost. He lives for the other, for the object
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:55.600]   of his love, and the one whom he loves really controls him in a totalitarian sense. Yes,
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.300]   but what a difference between that and the slavery of some terrible potentate, some awful
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.020]   tyrant. You see, there is a sense in which it is right to say that both of them are in
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.980]   a condition of slavery, and yet you don't leave it just at that. You've got to explain
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.180]   the difference in the slavery. In the second case, it's the willing slavery.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:24.660]   Well, let me use another statement made by this great apostle in order to show exactly
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:34.780]   what he means. Formally, the compulsion of which we were aware was the compulsion of
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:43.860]   the tyranny of Satan and of sin, black and terrible and awful. What is it now? Well,
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:54.180]   now he says it's this, "The love of Christ constraineth me." Do you remember that beautiful,
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:24:02.740]   wonderful phrase in 2 Corinthians 5? "The love of Christ constraineth me." And what
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:08.100]   it means is this. He says he's like a man in a vice, and the vice is being tightened
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.860]   up. There's pressure, there's compulsion. Yes, but what's bringing the pressure? Oh,
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:18.340]   it is the love of Christ. It's no longer a horrible tyranny. It is love. It's the
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.720]   tyranny of love, if you like. Here's a paradox, and this is the paradox of the whole Christian
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.820]   faith and the Christian position. The Christian is not a free man. He's a man who's, if
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:35.220]   you like, under the tyranny of love. "The love of Christ constraineth me." So he
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:43.020]   says, "Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel." He's the bond slave of Jesus
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:51.580]   Christ. Yes, but that's all the time a relationship which is one of love. And therefore, the apostle,
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:57.900]   it seems to me, here is just explaining that to us. What he, you see, was concerned to
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:06.060]   bring out was this, that there is a compulsion in both cases. There is a certainty of obedience
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:14.700]   in both cases. But the moment you've said that, everything else is different. The man
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:21.860]   who is a Christian is under this power of righteousness. He was under the power of sin
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:27.500]   before. Yes, he's under the power of righteousness now. Don't think of it as a detached question.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.540]   He's not a man who's absolutely free and detached and who may do this or that. No,
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:38.540]   no. There is a power in righteousness. We are under grace. Yes, says the apostle, that
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:44.140]   is common. And therefore, there is an element of certainty in this, as there was an element
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:50.020]   of certainty in the other. So that what he's really concerned to say, and this is his big
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:58.620]   point, is that the man who has been delivered from being under the law is a man who will
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:04.860]   never be in the position of saying, "What then? Shall we sin because we are not under
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:14.540]   the law but under grace?" The thing is quite impossible, because now he is under this compelling,
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:22.260]   constraining power of love and of righteousness. And therefore, that question is something
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:30.980]   which is quite unthinkable and utterly impossible. So the apostle says now, "I speak after the
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:37.660]   manner of men because of your infirmity. Be careful," he says, "how you make use even
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:44.140]   of my illustration. It only helps us up to a point beyond that it doesn't take us."
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:54.260]   Very well, that brings me to the last meaning to this extraordinarily illuminating phrase.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:02.500]   The final reason for his using his illustration and analogy, he tells us, was "because of
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:13.420]   the infirmity of your flesh." "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:23.340]   of your flesh." What does this mean? Well, here is a tremendous statement which throws
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:29.820]   tremendous light upon the whole question of the approach to the New Testament. What is
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:39.180]   he saying? Well, note this. He does not say, "I speak after the manner of men because
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:48.180]   of the infirmity of your intellects or your mind." He doesn't say that. He says, "because
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:58.900]   of the infirmity of your flesh." Here, I say, is one of those central, vital points
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:06.700]   in the whole of the New Testament teaching. He doesn't say "intellect," and I'm
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.660]   emphasizing it for this good reason, that if he had said "intellect," well, then
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:17.860]   he would be putting a premium on intellect. And he would be saying, "Well, now, of course,
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:22.740]   if you only had greater brains and greater intellects and greater understandings, I needn't
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.140]   have used my illustration at all. You would have understood the complete truth as it was
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:33.700]   as I stated it in my doctrine." But he isn't saying anything of the kind, and he
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.580]   never does say anything of the kind. And the New Testament as a whole, thank God, never
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:46.540]   says any such thing. No, what he does say is, "because of the infirmity of your flesh."
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:57.940]   What is the flesh? Well, the flesh means all the faculties of man as influenced by and
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:05.060]   perverted by and controlled by sin. That is what the flesh means. It doesn't mean the
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:10.180]   physical body. We've come across that term, "the body," before. We found it in verse
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.660]   12. This isn't the body here, this is the flesh, which is a very different thing. The
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:24.820]   flesh means the faculties of the body as dominated, perverted, and misused by sin. And he says
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:32.460]   it is the infirmity of the flesh, not of the mind and intellect alone, that makes it necessary
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.140]   for him to use his illustration.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:44.620]   Now, why do I say that this is so tremendously important? Well, for this reason. That according
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:56.740]   to this biblical teaching, man's trouble by nature is never that he merely lacks intellect.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:04.940]   What he does lack is spiritual understanding. Man's trouble is not in his mind. What is
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:11.260]   it then? Well, man's trouble is in the capacity and the ability to understand and to believe
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.220]   and to follow spiritual truth.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:23.020]   Here, you see, is the essential biblical doctrine of sin and of men in sin as the result of
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:30.340]   the Fall. What is the most devastating result of the Fall? Well, it is undoubtedly this,
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:37.420]   that man in the Fall has lost the capacity for spiritual apprehension. Now, before the
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:44.900]   Fall, he had it. Before the Fall, Adam was able to commune freely with God and to have
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:50.500]   fellowship with him. The moment he fell and sin came in, he lost that capacity. Spiritual
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:56.860]   apprehension, spiritual comprehension, spiritual understanding.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:03.340]   Now this is a very, very vital distinction. You see it, of course, worked out at great
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.460]   length in the passage that I read to you at the beginning, out of the first epistle of
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:13.620]   Paul to the Corinthians. He starts dealing with it round about verse 20 in chapter 1,
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:18.740]   and he goes right on with it, down to the middle of chapter 3. It's the great statement
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:24.340]   there, and it's a tremendously important one. The most devastating thing, I say, that
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:33.300]   sin does to man is to rob him of his power of spiritual apprehension.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:42.100]   Let me put it to you like this. The whole matter of becoming a Christian and of believing
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:50.380]   the Christian truth and having the Christian faith is not essentially a matter of intellect
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:32:00.540]   at all. And I say again, thank God for that. As the apostle argues, men of great natural
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:07.380]   capacity, of great intellects, great minds, great brains, great knowledge, great natural
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:16.100]   understanding see nothing whatsoever in Christianity. Indeed, as he says, they see nothing in it
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:23.140]   but utter folly. He says the Greeks regard it as a stumbling block, the Jews regard it
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:28.860]   as a stumbling block, and the Greeks regard it as foolishness. He says the foolishness
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.900]   of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. He says the natural
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.660]   men receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him,
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:44.100]   neither can he, because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.460]   Now these men have got wonderful brains, great intellects, but when you put them face
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:53.380]   to face with this, they see nothing in it at all. Talk to them about the soul, there
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.420]   isn't such a thing. They say it's nonsense. Hold them before the Lord Jesus Christ, tell
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:03.980]   them about his incarnation, the two natures in one person. Nonsense, folly, they say.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.100]   Hold them before the doctrine of the atonement and the death upon the cross. They say this
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.820]   is rubbish, it's immoral. They denounce it, they laugh at it, they ridicule it. Why? Ah,
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:21.500]   it's because they're lacking in this faculty of spiritual apprehension, spiritual understanding.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.380]   It's got nothing to do with the intellect, nothing whatsoever.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.380]   And then you see we can put the other side by putting it like this. On the other hand,
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:39.300]   there are simple people, ordinary people, poor brains, very little intellect and understanding,
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:44.980]   and yet they are able to understand these things. They rejoice in them, they revel in
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:51.060]   them. How are they enabled to do so? "Oh," says the apostle, "this is solely the result
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:57.340]   of the work of the Holy Spirit upon them. When the Son of God was in the world, the
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:02.620]   princes of this world didn't know him, for had they known him, they would not have crucified
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:08.420]   the Lord of glory." Well then, how can anybody be a Christian? "Oh," he says, "God hath
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:15.460]   revealed these things unto us by his Spirit, the Spirit which searcheth all things, yea,
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.980]   the deep things of God. For we have received not the Spirit that is of the world, but the
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:27.300]   Spirit that is of God, that we might understand the things that are freely given to us on
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:33.700]   the earth of God. It is all a matter of the illumination of the Spirit." And the apostle,
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:39.900]   of course, you remember glories in this. Listen to him saying it to the Corinthians. "For
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:44.580]   ye see your calling, brethren," and remember this is one of the greatest brains that the
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:50.380]   world has ever known speaking. "You see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.260]   men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath chosen
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:00.380]   the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weak things
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:05.260]   of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and base things of the world and
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:10.980]   things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not to bring to
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:22.060]   naught things that are, that no flesh should glory in his presence." That's it. It is
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:29.780]   nothing to do with intellect and natural ability and understanding. And the apostle glories
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:35.980]   in that fact. Is it putting a premium then upon ignorance? Not at all. It's just saying
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.340]   that this isn't the determining factor. A man shouldn't boast of his knowledge, he
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.260]   shouldn't boast of his ignorance either. A man shouldn't boast of his great brain,
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:48.940]   a man shouldn't boast of the fact that he hasn't got a great brain. And you realize
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.980]   that we need to say that on both sides, don't we? The temptation to some people is to boast
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:59.300]   about their great brains, but never forget that there is the equal temptation to the
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:04.220]   others to say, "Well, of course, I'm just an ordinary man, you know, and as he says
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.940]   it he's oozing out self-righteousness and pride. I'm not one of those men who understands
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.940]   your theology, I'm just the man who carries the bag of the preacher or something like
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:19.940]   that. Ah, it's the same unhealthy and vile and foul pride." No, no, you don't put
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:26.740]   a premium on either brains or lack of it, or knowledge or lack of it. Neither of them
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:33.500]   matters. It is the illumination of the spirit alone that counts.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:43.620]   But what an important thing this is. I'm not proposing on all future Friday evenings
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:51.100]   to refer, as I did last Friday evening, to that brain trust so-called, but I must refer
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:57.860]   to it once more. As I say, I happened to hear that repeat of that program last week, and
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:03.020]   in addition to what I told you last Friday, I heard this. A question, another question
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:08.460]   that was put to the brains trust was this one. "Why," said a questioner, "why does
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:19.020]   it seem to be the case that people on the brains trust seem to be able to answer and
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:26.940]   to discuss with ease and freedom and intelligence questions which are put to them on subjects
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:32.660]   which happen to be right out their own particular field of interest and of study, they seem
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.700]   to be able to do that with comparative ease and freedom? But why is it that when it becomes
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:44.620]   a question of theology, they don't seem to be able to do it here in the same way as
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:49.140]   they can do with other subjects, for instance?" Some of the members of the brains trust are
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.580]   literary people, and yet a question may come up on a scientific matter. And though they
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.260]   don't know much about science and are not specialists in any sense of the term in science,
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.060]   they seem to be able to talk about science quite freely and seem to be able to do so
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.620]   in an intelligent manner. But, says the questioner, "I've noticed that when it becomes a question
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:14.020]   of theology, they don't seem to be able to do so." And that was the question before
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:22.540]   the brains trust. And they seem to be quite incapable of answering the question. And the
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:28.460]   reason for that, of course, was the very thing that we are discussing at this particular
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:35.380]   moment. They were trying to say that here, of course, if you didn't know the terminology,
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.900]   or if you hadn't been reading a lot of it and were not well versed in it, you wouldn't
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.660]   be able to take part. That somehow or other, in connection with theology, that seemed to
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:47.220]   be necessary, not with other subjects. But that's got nothing to do with it, nothing
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:55.540]   at all. There is only one explanation why the learned members of the brains trust cannot
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:02.380]   speak freely about these matters, and it is this. They are matters that are spiritually
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:10.460]   discerned. And the greatest natural mind and brain is useless here. It's another realm
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:17.900]   which can only be introduced, and into which one can only be introduced, as the result
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:24.780]   of the operation of the Holy Spirit himself. It's another realm. It's the realm of the
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:32.620]   spiritual. Art and music and science and politics and all those things, they belong ultimately
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:39.460]   to the same realm. This doesn't belong to the same realm. And a man is completely at
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:49.780]   sea here until he has been given the illumination of the Spirit, until he has this new faculty.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:57.420]   This is indeed something to glory in. Face to face with Christianity, we are all on the
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:04.780]   same level. That's what proves, you see, it's God's way of salvation. If it had been man's
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:09.380]   way of salvation, it would depend upon our minds and intellects and understandings, and
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:14.340]   then of course some people would have a great advantage over others. But God has contrived
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.620]   a way of salvation in which nobody has an advantage over anybody else. We are, every
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:25.780]   one of us, reduced to the same level, complete helplessness, absolute impotence. No brain
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:35.100]   is of value, no lack of brain is of value. We are all in the same position. We are all
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:45.500]   on the same level. We all fail to the same degree. We are all equally helpless. And on
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:55.540]   the other side, there is therefore a corresponding hope of salvation for all types.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:00.740]   What a wonderful salvation this is. That is why I say again, it doesn't matter at all
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:06.260]   to the preacher in this ultimate evangelistic sense, what is the character of the people
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:10.220]   who are sitting in front of him. He knows they are all sinners. He is not interested
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.460]   whether they have got great brains or little brains. He is not at all interested if they
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.980]   are the most cultured people in the world or the most ignorant people in the world.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:24.460]   He knows they are all sinners. He knows they have all got a blind spot where God and spiritual
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:29.300]   truth are concerned, and that they can do nothing about it, that they need the illumination
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:37.420]   of the Spirit, every one of them. And he knows, therefore, that there is an equal hope for
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:47.260]   all. What a gospel that has baffled the greatest philosophers that the world has ever known,
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:54.060]   and yet can save in a moment a man in the heart of Africa who can't even read and write.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:03.140]   That is the gospel. What a glorious gospel it is. The apostle says, "The difficulty
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:08.420]   about understanding the truth lies in the infirmity of your flesh." That is where
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:14.340]   it is. It isn't your minds. It is this fallen nature. It is the loss of this spiritual power
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:20.340]   of apprehension. It is in the flesh, not the mind, not the intellect, in the flesh. And
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:26.100]   that is why he says, "I have had to use my illustration." But let us, to make it
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:38.780]   complete, notice this, that though we are born again and illuminated of the Spirit,
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:45.400]   we are still imperfect in this respect. Don't misunderstand what I have just been saying
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:55.820]   in this way, that because this understanding is the result of the illumination of the Spirit,
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:00.820]   and because we must all have that illumination, and because all who are Christians have had
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:07.060]   that illumination, that therefore every Christian is identical with every other and is in exactly
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:12.540]   the same position as regards understanding and comprehension. It doesn't follow at
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:22.860]   all. Now then, this is a very important addition, isn't it? We know nothing of spiritual truth
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:30.740]   at all apart from the illumination of the Spirit. But having had the illumination of
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:45.900]   the Spirit, there are all kinds and possibilities of variation and of amount of understanding.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.700]   What you mean, says someone, I mean this, I mean that the faculty that is given to us
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:58.100]   by the Holy Spirit can be developed by us. Now did you notice how the apostle put that
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:03.500]   to the Corinthians? He says, look here, "I could not speak unto you hitherto as unto
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:09.180]   wise, but even as unto babes in Christ." He says, "I couldn't speak the wisdom I
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:14.020]   have just been talking about to you because you are yet carnal." He says, "I couldn't
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:18.340]   feed you with meat because you are babes, I had to give you milk." "Howbeit," he
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:26.580]   says, "we speak wisdom among them that are perfect." And you see what makes the difference
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:35.220]   in the various gradations amongst the Christians is the extent to which they have used or have
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:42.340]   failed to use this power, this faculty, that has been given to them by the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:49.140]   Let the author of the epistle to the Hebrews support and clinch the thing that the apostle
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:56.140]   Paul has been saying. You remember that he tells them in chapter 5 that he wanted to
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:04.460]   tell them a great deal more about the doctrine of our Lord and Savior as the Melchizedek,
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:08.900]   the high priest after the order of Melchizedek. He says, "I've got many things to say
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:14.900]   about this and things which are hard to be understood because you are dull of hearing."
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:23.140]   He says, "For whereas ye are to be teachers in these matters, ye have need that one teach
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:28.780]   you again which be the first principles of the doctrines of Christ, and of need of milk
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:36.460]   and of not of strong meat." Why? Well, he tells them, because they had not been exercising
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:45.980]   their senses in the matter of understanding. They had been content to remain as babes,
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:51.180]   and the result was he couldn't give them that deeper teaching, that higher doctrine
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.040]   that he was so anxious to give them. I think there are many Christian people who forget
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.060]   all about this at the present time. There are Christians who say, "You know, I'm
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.540]   saved, that's all right, I'm not interested in anything else. I'm not a theologian,
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.900]   I don't want to read these great books." But my dear friend, you have no right to
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:12.380]   remain a babe. You have no right not to exercise your senses. "Ah, but I'm a practical
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.420]   man," you say, "I'm a great worker." You have no right to divide yourself up
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:21.740]   in that way. It should be the ambition and the desire of every Christian to grow in grace
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:27.660]   and in the knowledge of the Lord. You should read all the best books you can, study your
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:35.140]   scriptures, get the knowledge as deep and as profound as is capable, exercise your senses.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:43.100]   Because, say, these authors, if you don't do that, you can't receive the truth. If
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:48.140]   you remain a babe and if you don't grow and develop, you'll have to continue being
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:54.380]   spoon-fed with milk, and you'll never know anything about the strong meat of the Word
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:47:00.300]   of God and of the doctrines of salvation. And thus, you see, it is possible for this
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:10.200]   apostle at one and the same time to say two things about these Roman Christians that seem
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:19.300]   to be contradictory. In chapter 15, in verse 14, he says this, "I myself also am persuaded
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:27.620]   of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:36.380]   also to admonish one another." And yet here he says, "I speak to you after the manner
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:47.020]   of men because of the infirmity of your flesh." And you see that there is no contradiction
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:54.660]   at all. They had got light, they had got spiritual understanding. Yes, but he says, "You haven't
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:00.860]   got enough yet to follow this profound and deep doctrine that I'm teaching you in this
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:07.980]   chapter." And the two things are perfectly compatible with one another. Indeed, I can
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:15.040]   end by putting it in the words of our blessed Lord himself. He was talking about listening
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:26.900]   to the gospel, and this is what he said, "Unto him that hath shall be given, and he shall
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:38.700]   have more abundance. Take heed," he says, "unto him that hath shall be given." The more
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:43.620]   you understand this doctrine, the more you'll understand. And the more you'll understand,
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:47.500]   the more you'll get. And the more you'll get, the more you'll understand. And on and on
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:58.940]   and on it goes. You have to be a strong man before you can take strong meat. So our business,
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:07.780]   you see, is to grow and to develop, to exercise our senses. And if we do so, and as we do
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:15.020]   so, the use of analogies and illustrations will become less and less necessary. So we
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:20.540]   shan't be listening to the same simple gospel messages with the same sort of stories and
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:26.260]   illustrations fifty years hence. As we're doing now, we'll want something more, and
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:33.980]   we'll be able to take more. Is there anything so tragic as to observe Christian people remaining
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:39.980]   exactly the same at the end as they were at the beginning? Never growing, never developing?
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:47.900]   No, no, says our Lord, "unto him that hath shall be given, and he shall have more abundance."
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:59.980]   Very well, then, I leave you with this question. What kind of food can we take? Are we still
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:11.020]   only capable of taking milk? Or are we beginning to develop a taste for meat? Are illustrations
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:18.580]   and analogies still essential? Or do we know something of the mind expanding under the
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:28.700]   new illumination of the Spirit and rejoicing in the deep things of God? The Spirit searcheth
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:40.460]   all things, yea, the deep things of God. I must confess that there is nothing that ever
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:46.340]   happens in my experience which depresses me more than this. Sometimes when I'm preaching
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:53.220]   away, and I have preached what I would have thought were the very elements and the beginnings
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:59.180]   of the Christian faith, people come to me and say, "You know, you were making rather
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:05.980]   a demand upon us this evening or this afternoon." They say, "We are not accustomed to those
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:14.340]   deep things, deep things." And I thought I was being elementary. That's amongst Christian
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:25.020]   and evangelical people. My dear friends, let us realize then these fundamental principles.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:35.740]   Though we are in Christ, this infirmity remains, and we must fight against it. We must read,
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:41.500]   we must study, we must meditate, we must grow, we must exercise the faculties, we must grapple
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:46.820]   with these immensities. Hard to be understood, I agree with Peter, but apply your minds,
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:54.100]   therefore. Struggle with them. Insist upon getting an understanding. And if you've
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:52:00.380]   got a willing heart and a willing desire, you can be certain that the Spirit will ever
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:10.460]   come to your aid, and you will grow not only in grace, but in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:21.740]   I speak after the manner of men. Because of the infirmity of your flesh, watch every word
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:29.100]   that this apostle writes. You will find gems of deep truth in what on the surface appears
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:43.460]   to be nothing but a casual, passing remark. Let us pray. O Lord, our God, we do indeed
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:50.100]   come into thy holy presence once more, and we come to thank thee and to praise thy name.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:57.340]   We thank thee above all for the perfection of thy plan of salvation, for the way in which
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:06.060]   it thus reduces us all to the same level of inability and nothingness, and thereby holds
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:15.620]   out a hope for all. We thank thee for it. We bless, we magnify thy name. We glory in
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:26.020]   so great a salvation. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:31.780]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:40.180]   this night, throughout the remainder of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:47.300]   and evermore. Amen.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:51.380]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
