[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.640]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.840]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.560]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.960]   Today's episode is going to be all about
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.520]   the science of emotions.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.600]   And today, we're gonna talk in particular
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.160]   about something that most often is called stress.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.320]   You might be thinking, wait, stress isn't an emotion,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.060]   but stress really lies at the heart
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.280]   of whether or not our internal experience
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.240]   is matched well or not to our external experience
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   or the events that are happening to us and around us.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.440]   And as you'll soon see, those converge or combine
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.160]   to create what we call emotions.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.680]   I'd like you to come away from today's episode
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.600]   with what I call an organizational logic,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.440]   a framework for thinking about these things
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680]   that typically we just call happy or sad
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.680]   or depressed or anxious.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.440]   And I'm going to make sure that you have tools
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.200]   that are grounded in physiology and neuroscience
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   that will allow you to navigate
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.720]   this otherwise complex space that we call emotions
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.760]   that will allow you to ground yourself better
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.440]   when you're feeling like life is weighing on you
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.520]   or you're kind of being pulled by the currents of life,
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.720]   as well as to support other people,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.920]   whether or not that's in a psychological practice,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.960]   if you're a practitioner,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.640]   or you have clients or children or spouses,
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.320]   really to be able to support other people
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.320]   in your environment better.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.440]   And as you may recall, the nervous system,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.340]   which includes the brain and the eyes and the spinal cord,
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.640]   but also all the connections with the organs of the body,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.440]   includes the brain and body.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.920]   And those organs of the body,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.840]   your gut and your liver and your spleen,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.080]   they're also communicating with the brain.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.920]   So I look forward to a day, in fact,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.600]   when we no longer think about neuroscience
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.720]   as just the brain.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.200]   And many neuroscientists now also think about the body,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.180]   of course, the brain controls the body,
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.280]   but the body is also having a very profound
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.840]   and concrete influence on the brain.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.000]   Today, we're going to talk about objective tools
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.760]   that match the brain-body experience
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.480]   or separate the brain-body experience
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.100]   in ways that leverage your ability to lean into life better,
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.760]   to feel better, literally,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.340]   to just feel better about what you're experiencing,
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.160]   and believe it or not,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   to be able to control your emotions when that's appropriate.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.300]   Okay, so what is stress?
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.140]   We hear all the time that stress is bad.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.160]   We hear people saying they're really stressed out.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.020]   What is stress?
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.400]   Stress at its core is a generalized system.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.480]   It wasn't designed for tigers attacking us
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.860]   or people attacking us.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.660]   It's a system to mobilize other systems
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.920]   in the brain and body.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.320]   It wasn't designed for one thing.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.760]   And that gives it a certain advantage
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.240]   in taking over the state of our brain and body,
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.040]   but it also gives you, all of us,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.240]   an advantage in controlling it
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.560]   because it's based on hardwired biological mechanisms
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.020]   and there are hardwired biological mechanisms,
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.920]   meaning cells and chemicals and pathways and tissues
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.300]   that exist in you right now
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.780]   that require no neuroplasticity
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.980]   that allow you to put a brake on stress.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.840]   And so we're going to talk about those.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.000]   So let's talk about the stress response.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.500]   And by doing that,
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.880]   you will understand exactly why the tools
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.280]   I'm going to give you work.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.680]   For those of you that are saying,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.760]   "Wait, I just want the tools, just give me a summary."
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.800]   Trust me, if you understand mechanism,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.920]   you are going to be in a far better position
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.840]   to incorporate these tools, to teach these tools to others,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.680]   and to modify them as your life circumstances change.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.920]   Let's be clear about what we already know,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   which is that stressors can be psychological
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.080]   or they can be physical, okay?
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.580]   If I put you outside on a cold day without a jacket
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.480]   for a very long time, that is stressful.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.120]   If I have you prepare for too many exams at once
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.400]   and you can't balance it all with your sleep schedule
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.840]   and your other needs for comfort and wellbeing
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.100]   like food, rest, sleep, and social connection,
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.900]   that is stressful.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.040]   So what happens when the stress response hits?
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.760]   Let's talk about the immediate
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.420]   or what we call the acute stress response.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.520]   We could also think of this as short-term stress.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.600]   So you have a collection of neurons
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   that start right about at your neck
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.720]   and run down to about your navel, a little bit lower.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.160]   And those are called the sympathetic chain ganglia.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.280]   When something stresses us out, either in our mind
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.480]   or because something enters our environment,
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.540]   that chain of neurons becomes activated
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.760]   like a bunch of dominoes falling all at once.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.820]   It's very fast.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.840]   When those neurons are activated, acetylcholine is released,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.360]   but there are some other neurons
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.380]   for the aficionados out there.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.400]   They're called the post-ganglionic neurons.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.720]   Those ones respond to that acetylcholine
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.180]   and then they release epinephrine,
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.880]   which is the equivalent to adrenaline.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.680]   So we have this system where it's very fast.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.100]   Whenever we're stressed, the core of our body,
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.560]   these neurons down the middle of our body,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.360]   release these chemicals.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.580]   And then there's adrenaline or epinephrine
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.200]   released at particular organs and acts in particular ways.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.160]   Some things like the muscles of your legs and your heart
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   and other things that need to be active
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.720]   when you're stressed,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.340]   they have a certain kind of receptor,
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.480]   which is called the beta receptor.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.660]   And that beta receptor responds to epinephrine
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.860]   and blood vessels dilate.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.920]   They get bigger and blood rushes in to our legs.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.940]   The heart rate speeds up.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.240]   Lots of things happen that get activated.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.960]   And at the same time,
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.820]   that epinephrine activates other receptors
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.680]   on certain tissues that we don't need,
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.160]   the ones involved in digestion, reproduction,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.040]   and things of that sort that are luxuries
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.640]   for when things are going well,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.100]   not things to pay attention to when we're stressed.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.240]   So the stress response is two pronged.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.160]   It's a yes for certain things
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.120]   and it's a no you may not right now for other things.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.000]   That's why you feel blood
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.960]   in certain organs and tissues of your body,
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.180]   but not in others.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.960]   But basically you are activated
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.520]   in ways that support you moving.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.640]   And that's because fundamentally the stress response
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.800]   is just this generic thing that says, do something.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.040]   You're going to feel agitated
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.520]   and that's because it was designed to move you.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.880]   So this is important because if you want to control stress,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.380]   you need to learn how to work with that agitation.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.560]   I'd like to give you a tool at this point,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.240]   because I think if we go any further
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.400]   with a lot more science,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.260]   people are going to begin to wonder
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.440]   if this is just going to be a kind of
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.640]   standard university lecture about the stress response.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.580]   If you want to reduce the magnitude of the stress response,
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.800]   the best thing you can do is activate
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.280]   the other system in the body,
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.960]   which is designed for calming and relaxation.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.720]   And that system is called
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.120]   the parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.440]   And the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.400]   is really interesting because especially the cranial nerves,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.760]   the ones that are up in the brainstem
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.460]   and in the neck area,
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.800]   those have a direct line to various features of your face,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.600]   in particular, the eyes.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.060]   They control things like eye movements, pupil dilation,
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.280]   things of that sort,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   as well as the tongue, the facial muscles, et cetera.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.560]   So I'm going to teach you the first tool now,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.880]   so I don't overwhelm you with all this academic knowledge
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.960]   without giving you something useful.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.220]   And the tool that, at least to my knowledge,
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.940]   is the fastest and most thoroughly grounded
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.700]   in physiology and neuroscience for calming down
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.420]   in a self-directed way
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.460]   is what's called the physiological PSY, S-I-G-H.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.460]   What I'm talking about when I refer to physiological PSYs
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.420]   is the very real medical school textbook relationship
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.100]   between the brain, the body,
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.580]   and the body as it relates to the breathing apparati,
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.820]   meaning the diaphragm and lungs, and the heart.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.140]   Let's take the hallmark of the stress response.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.700]   The heart starts beating faster.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.540]   Blood is shuttled to the big muscles of the body
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.980]   to move you away from whatever it is the stressor is,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.260]   or just make you feel like you need to move or talk.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.920]   Your face goes flushed, et cetera.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.300]   There is, however, a way in which you can breathe
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.160]   that directly controls your heart rate
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.260]   through the interactions between the sympathetic
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.700]   and the parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.460]   Here's how it works.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.560]   When you inhale,
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.940]   so whether or not it's through the nose or through the mouth,
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.240]   this skeletal muscle that's inside your body,
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.420]   called the diaphragm, it moves down.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.300]   And that's because the lungs expand, the diaphragm moves down.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.160]   Your heart actually gets a little bit bigger
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.540]   in that expanded space.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.060]   There's more space for the heart.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.220]   And as a consequence,
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.000]   whatever blood is in there is now at a lower volume
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.280]   or moving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.340]   than it was before you inhaled.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.180]   Okay, so more space, heart gets bigger,
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.460]   blood moves more slowly,
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.140]   and there's a little group of neurons
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.460]   called the sinoatrial node in the heart
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.660]   that registers, believe it or not,
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.300]   those neurons pay attention
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.620]   to the rate of blood flow through the heart,
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.380]   and send a signal up to the brain
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.740]   that blood is moving more slowly through the heart.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.460]   The brain then sends a signal back to the heart
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.300]   to speed the heart up.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.940]   So what this means is if you want your heart to beat faster,
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.940]   inhale longer, inhale more vigorously than your exhales.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.880]   Now, the opposite is also true.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.800]   If you want to slow your heart rate down,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.400]   so stress response hits,
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.680]   you want to slow your heart rate down.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.220]   What you want to do is, again,
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.000]   capitalize on this relationship between the body,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.200]   meaning the diaphragm and the heart, and the brain.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.040]   Here's how it works.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.880]   When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.160]   which makes the heart a little bit smaller.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.660]   It actually gets a little more compact.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.200]   Blood flows more quickly through that compact space.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.940]   The sinoatrial node registers
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.320]   that blood is going more quickly,
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.780]   sends a signal up to the brain,
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.980]   and the parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.860]   some neurons in your brainstem,
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.880]   send a signal back to the heart to slow the heart down.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.400]   So if you want to calm down quickly,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.520]   you need to make your exhales longer
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.900]   and/or more vigorous than your inhales.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.940]   Now, the reason this is so attractive
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.320]   as a tool for controlling stress
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.100]   is that it works in real time.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.380]   This doesn't involve a practice that you have to go
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.860]   and sit there and do anything separate from life.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.420]   The physiological side is something
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.260]   that people naturally start doing when they've been crying
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.300]   and they're trying to recover some air or calm down,
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.180]   when they've been sobbing very hard,
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.580]   or when they are in claustrophobic environments.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.620]   However, the amazing thing about this thing
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.500]   that we call the diaphragm, the skeletal muscle,
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.920]   is that it's an internal organ
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.460]   that you can control voluntarily.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.700]   So this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.140]   through what's called the phrenic nerve,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.780]   P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.440]   The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.900]   You can control it anytime you want.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.340]   You can double up your inhales or triple up your inhales.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.500]   You can exhale more than your inhales,
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.140]   whatever you want to do.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.340]   It's such an incredible organ.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.180]   And the physiological side is something
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.260]   that we do spontaneously.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.200]   But when you're feeling stressed,
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.440]   you can do a double inhale.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.940]   [inhales]
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.060]   [exhales]
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:51.960]   Long exhale.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.440]   Now, I just told you a minute ago
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.440]   that if you inhale more than you exhale,
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.140]   you're going to speed the heart rate up,
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.660]   which would promote more stress and activation.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.940]   Now I'm telling you to do a double inhale exhale
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.580]   in order to calm down.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.540]   And the reason is the double inhale exhale,
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.400]   which is the physiological sigh,
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.100]   takes advantage of the fact
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.500]   that when we do a double inhale,
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.180]   even if the second inhale is sneaking
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.780]   in just a tiny bit more air,
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.720]   'cause it's kind of hard to get
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.260]   two deep inhales back to back.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.260]   You do big, deep inhale,
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.340]   and then another little one sneaking it in.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.100]   The little sacs in your lungs,
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.220]   the alveoli of the lungs,
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.620]   your lungs aren't just two big bags,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.340]   but you've got millions of little sacs
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.460]   throughout the lungs
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.560]   that actually make the surface area of your lungs
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.180]   as big as a tennis court.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.140]   It's amazing.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.360]   If we were to just spread that out.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.480]   Those tend to collapse as we get stressed
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.640]   and carbon dioxide builds up in our bloodstream.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.720]   And that's one of the reasons we feel agitated as well.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.960]   But when you do the double inhale exhale,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.720]   the double inhale reinflates
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.120]   those little sacs of the lungs.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.760]   And then when you do the long exhale,
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.920]   that long exhale is now much more effective
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.280]   at ridding your body and bloodstream of carbon dioxide,
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.700]   which relaxes you very quickly.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.680]   When you're feeling stressed,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.740]   the physiological sigh done just one to three times.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.080]   So it'd be double inhale, exhale,
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.440]   double inhale, exhale, maybe just two times
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.220]   will bring down your level of stress very, very fast.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.060]   And as far as I know,
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.120]   it's the fastest way to accomplish that.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.680]   Be aware that if you're going to use the physiological sigh
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.520]   or exhale emphasize breathing to calm down,
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.460]   that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 seconds
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.360]   to come down to baseline.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.480]   And you may need to repeat the physiological sigh
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.520]   a few times.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.880]   So let's think about something now.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.520]   Let's think about stress from not whether or not
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.920]   it's acute or chronic,
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.440]   whether or not it's good for us or bad for us,
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.640]   but on three different timescales,
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.520]   because then we can arrive at what this is all about
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.040]   as it relates to emotions.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.800]   But I really want you to understand the difference
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.640]   between the three kinds of stress
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.120]   on three different timescales,
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.640]   short-term, medium-term, and long-term,
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.320]   and what it's good for and what it's bad for.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.600]   I think we've all heard that stress is bad for us.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.860]   We've seen these pictures intended to frighten us,
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.000]   and indeed they are frightening.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.120]   You see the nice, really plump brain on the left
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.560]   says healthy or control.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.660]   And then you see the brain that says stressed above it
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.880]   on the right, and it's like withered.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.480]   Or we see that the hippocampus,
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.880]   an area involved in memory is smaller.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.100]   People that are stressed.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.920]   I think we've all heard now so many times that stress is bad
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.120]   but in that conversation,
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.480]   unfortunately, it's eclipsed
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.420]   some of the really positive things
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.180]   that stress does for us in the short-term.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.680]   When the stress response hits,
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.920]   that is good for your immune system.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.680]   I know that might be a tough pill to swallow,
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.760]   but it's absolutely true.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.520]   In fact, stress often comes in the form
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.200]   of bacterial or viral infection.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.600]   And the stress response is in part organized
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.680]   to combat bacterial and viral infection.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.000]   So short-term stress
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.600]   and the release of adrenaline in particular or epinephrine,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.440]   same thing, adrenaline epinephrine,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.080]   is good for combating infection.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.400]   And this to me is just not discussed enough,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.120]   so that's why I'm discussing it here.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.980]   And it relates to a particular tool
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.080]   that many of you ask about,
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.000]   but I don't often get the opportunity to talk about
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.080]   in such an appropriate context.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.120]   It's not that it's ever inappropriate to talk about,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.440]   but what I'm about to talk about now
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.780]   is the use of, again, respiration, breathing,
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.780]   to somewhat artificially activate the stress response.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.560]   And that will accomplish two things, okay?
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.160]   I'll return to medium and long-term stress,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.720]   but I want to say short-term stress is good
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.160]   because the dilation of the pupils,
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.780]   the changes in the optics of the eyes,
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.320]   the quickening of the heart rate,
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.020]   the sharpening of your cognition.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.840]   And in fact, that short-term stress
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.700]   brings certain elements of the brain online
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.280]   that allow you to focus.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.440]   Now, it narrows your focus.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.800]   You're not good at seeing the so-called big picture,
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.140]   but it narrows your focus.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.840]   It allows you to do these,
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.360]   what I call duration path outcome types of analysis.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.880]   It allows you to evaluate your environment,
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.580]   evaluate what you need to do.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.620]   It primes your whole system for better cognition.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.360]   It primes your immune system to combat infection.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.600]   And that all makes sense when you think about the fact
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   that famine, thirst, bacterial infections,
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.800]   viral infections, invaders,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.480]   all of this stuff liberates a response in the body
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.400]   that's designed to get you to fight back
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.660]   against whatever stressor that happens to be,
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.740]   psychological, physical, bacterial, viral.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.520]   Again, the stress response is generic.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.480]   The tool takes advantage of the fact
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.020]   that when adrenaline is released in the body
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.560]   from the adrenals,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.720]   it has the effect of also liberating
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.280]   a lot of these killer cells from the immune organs,
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.600]   in particular from the spleen,
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.280]   but from elsewhere as well,
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.740]   and interactions with the lymphatic system
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.420]   that combat infection.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.880]   The way this works in the real world
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.840]   is best captured by a study
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.120]   that can be mapped back to so-called Wim Hof breathing.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.360]   Now Wim Hof breathing is so named
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.080]   after the so-called Iceman Wim Hof.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.160]   There are two components to a sort of breathing protocol
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.280]   that he developed that was based also
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.860]   on what's called TUMO breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.160]   So before Wim, there was TUMO breathing,
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.920]   and many people call this now super oxygenation breathing.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.900]   So it's deliberate hyperventilation.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.060]   Why would somebody want to do this?
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.440]   Well, deliberate hyperventilation done for maybe 25 cycles.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.280]   So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   That pattern of breathing,
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.000]   rapid movements of the diaphragm
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.520]   will liberate adrenaline from the adrenals.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.400]   When adrenaline is released in the body,
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.720]   you are in a better position to combat infections.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.040]   And so whether or not you breathe very quickly
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.440]   in these cycles of 25 breaths,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.840]   and regardless of what you call it, doesn't matter,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.040]   adrenaline is released.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.600]   If you take a cold shower, adrenaline is released.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.380]   If you go into an ice bath deliberately,
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.400]   and even if you do it non-deliberately,
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.580]   adrenaline is released.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.760]   You are mimicking the stress response.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.800]   And that adrenaline serves to suppress
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.540]   or combat incoming infections.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.360]   And this was beautifully shown in a study
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.440]   that was published in a very fine journal,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.400]   the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.200]   for the US, it's literally called
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.360]   Proceedings of the National Academy of USA
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.300]   to distinguish it from other proceedings
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.700]   of other national academies in other countries.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:40.880]   The way the experiment went is that people were injected
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.120]   with endotoxin, or in some cases they were injected
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.600]   with a bacterial wall that mimics infection.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.000]   It gives you a fever.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.060]   It makes you feel nauseous.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:51.900]   It makes you feel sick.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.760]   It is not pleasant.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.920]   Half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.880]   that looked very much like the pattern of breathing
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.900]   I described a moment ago of doing 25 deep inhales
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.000]   and exhales followed by an exhale, holding their breath,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.140]   then repeating, 25 inhales, exhales, holding their breath.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.380]   So this would look something like this,
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.040]   or if you're listening, it sounds like [inhales and exhales]
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.680]   25, 30 times, you'll start feeling heated up.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.280]   You'll start feeling the adrenaline response.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.760]   You're liberating adrenaline in your body.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.400]   Then exhale, hold your breath for 15 seconds,
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   and then repeat.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.120]   Now, I want to emphasize, never, ever, ever do this
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.520]   anywhere near water.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.840]   People have passed out, so-called shallow water blackout.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.680]   People have died.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.500]   Please don't do it at all unless you get clearance
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.920]   to do it from your doctor,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.000]   because there are some pulmonary effects and whatnot,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.840]   and the breath holds should definitely not be done
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.000]   by anyone that has glaucoma or pressure concerns
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.040]   for the eyes, but these repeated cycles of breathing
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.800]   that liberate adrenaline allowed the group
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.240]   that did that protocol to essentially experience
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.880]   zero symptoms from the injection of this E. coli,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.220]   which is remarkable.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.280]   They had much reduced or no symptoms.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.560]   They didn't feel feverish.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.440]   They didn't feel sick.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.100]   They weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, which is remarkable,
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.800]   but makes total sense when you think about the fact
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.320]   that the short-term stress response,
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.640]   that what's typically called the acute stress response,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.760]   is designed to combat all stressors.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.480]   Many of us are familiar with the experience
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.700]   of work, work, work, work, work,
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.280]   or taking care of a loved one,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.520]   or stress, stress, stress, stress, stress,
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.660]   and then we finally relax.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.240]   Maybe we even go on vacation.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.920]   Like, oh, now I'm finally going to get the break,
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.360]   and then we get sick,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.040]   and that's because the adrenaline response crashed
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.960]   and your immune system crashed with it.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.360]   So please understand this.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.440]   Now, many of you might say, well, how long?
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.380]   Is it two hours?
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.220]   Is it three hours?
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.960]   A lot of you out there that really like specificity,
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.920]   it will vary for everybody.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.960]   I would just kind of use a rule of thumb.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.920]   When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.520]   what good sleep means to you,
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.200]   and please see the episodes on sleep
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.580]   if you want more about tools to sleep.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.860]   When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep,
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.480]   you are now moving from acute stress to chronic stress.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.560]   You need to be able to turn the stress response off.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.640]   Okay, so now let's talk about medium-term stress.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.700]   Medium-term stress is going to be stress
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.420]   that lasts anywhere from several days to several weeks.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.820]   What is stress threshold?
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.340]   Well, stress threshold is actually our ability
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.140]   to cognitively regulate what's going on in our body.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.020]   A lot of stress inoculation,
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.940]   a lot of managing medium-term stress
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.820]   on the timescale of weeks or maybe even a couple months.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.980]   So we're not talking about years of stress.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.620]   A lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.760]   It's about capacity.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.240]   And there are very simple tools,
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.220]   excellent tools that will allow us
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.380]   to modulate our capacity for stress.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.820]   And they look a lot like the tools I just described.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.900]   They involve placing oneself deliberately
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.700]   into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat,
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.520]   not to the extreme.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.460]   And then when we feel flooded with adrenaline
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   and normally we would panic,
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.380]   it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally,
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.820]   calming ourselves and being comfortable
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.620]   with that response in our body.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.140]   And what would this look like?
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.900]   You can use the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.220]   to combat infection if you're feeling kind of run down.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.180]   And there's also a way in which you can use things
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.660]   like cold showers, or if you exercise
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.420]   and you bring your heart rate up very high,
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.580]   you kind of go into that high intensity realm
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.860]   where your heart is beating a little bit harder
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.860]   than you're comfortable with.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.840]   The key in those moments is to learn to relax the mind
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.080]   while the body is very activated.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.420]   One way that you can do this, and this is kind of fun,
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.820]   if it's approved by your physician
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.060]   and you're able to do this,
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.460]   you can bring your heart rate up.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.720]   You could do this through an ice bath if that's your thing,
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.380]   or a cold shower, or cyclic oxygenation breathing,
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.220]   or you could sprint, or you could go hard on the bike,
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.420]   whatever it is that brings your heart rate up.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.540]   And then what you want to do is you want to actually try
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.180]   and calm the mind while your body
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.380]   is in this heightened state of activation.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.100]   When we are stressed, our pupils dilate.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.340]   The effect of that pupil dilation
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.740]   is to create tunnel vision.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.920]   It literally narrows our view of the visual world.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.140]   We no longer see in panorama.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.600]   And there's some other effects as well,
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.060]   but that's because the visual system
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.700]   through this cranial nerve system that I described before
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.060]   is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.880]   By deliberately dilating your gaze,
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.740]   meaning not moving your head and eyes around,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.020]   but by deliberately going from tunnel vision
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.260]   to broader panoramic vision,
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.940]   literally seeing more of your environment all at once,
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.820]   it creates a calming effect on the mind
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.420]   because it releases a particular circuit in the brainstem
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.240]   that's associated with alertness, aka stress.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.060]   Now, this is very powerful.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.480]   If you're running, for instance,
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.980]   and you're at max capacity or close to it,
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.620]   or you're kind of hitting like 80, 90% of maximum
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.720]   on the bike and you dilate your gaze,
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.400]   what you'll find is the mind can relax
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.540]   while the body is in full output.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.940]   And this relates to work that in various communities,
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.980]   people are working with this in the sports community,
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.540]   military communities, et cetera.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.940]   But it's a form, not really of stress inoculation.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.440]   It's more about raising stress threshold
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.980]   so that the body is going to continue
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.420]   to be in a high alertness, high reactivity mode,
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.140]   high output, but the mind is calm.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.680]   And so this isn't about unifying mind and body.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.340]   This is actually about using body
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.180]   to bring up your level of activation,
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.740]   then dissociating,
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.040]   not the clinical dissociation kind of disorders,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.120]   but dissociating the mental or emotional response
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.300]   from what's going on in your body.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.540]   And over time, so if you do this a couple of times,
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.100]   you don't have to do this every workout,
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.580]   but if you do this every, maybe once a week or so,
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.200]   you start being comfortable
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.100]   at these higher activation states.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.040]   What once felt overwhelming and like a lot of work,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.660]   now is manageable, it feels tolerable.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.260]   So that's for navigating medium term stress.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.200]   And then there's long-term stress.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.260]   Now, long-term stress is bad.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.900]   You do not want adrenaline up in your system
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.260]   for a very long time.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.780]   In fact, ideally, you would have your stress go up
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.460]   various times throughout the day,
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.260]   but it would never stay elevated
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.200]   and it would never prevent you
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.380]   from getting a good night's sleep.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.620]   We know that chronic stress, elevated stress,
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.260]   and especially in the so-called type A personalities,
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.820]   creates heart disease,
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.000]   leading killer for in most every country,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.560]   but in particular in the US.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.760]   But by no means do you want to be stressed out
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.440]   all the time chronically for months and months and months
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.560]   and years on end.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.460]   The best tools, the best mechanisms that we know
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.400]   to modulate long-term stress
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.000]   might surprise you a little bit.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.760]   First of all, there are going to be the things
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.600]   that don't surprise you,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.980]   which is everyone knows getting regular exercise,
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.200]   getting good sleep, using real-time tools
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.640]   to try and tamp down the stress response, et cetera.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.480]   That's all going to be really useful.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:12.420]   The data really point to the fact that social connection
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.680]   and certain types of social connection in particular
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.480]   are what are going to mitigate or reduce long-term stress.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.320]   And this is a particularly important issue nowadays
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.680]   where we have all these proxies or surrogates
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.100]   for social connection.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.640]   You know, we're online and texting with people a lot.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.960]   Everyone has this kind of need
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.280]   to stay connected to one another.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.140]   Humans are incredibly social creatures.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.760]   The way to think about social connection
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.800]   and how it can mitigate
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.000]   some of the long-term effects of stress
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.140]   is really through the systems of neuromodulation,
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.600]   like serotonin.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.860]   Serotonin, again, is a neuromodulator.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.660]   Neuromodulators are a little bit like playlists in the brain.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.300]   They tend to amplify or bias the likelihood
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.140]   that certain brain circuits and body circuits
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.540]   are going to be activated and that others will not.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.580]   Serotonin generally gives us feelings of wellbeing
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.500]   at very high levels.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.420]   It makes us feel blissed.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.820]   And it tends to make us feel like we have enough
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.100]   in our immediate environment.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.460]   When we see somebody that we recognize and trust,
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.300]   serotonin is released in the brain.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.220]   And that has certain positive effects on the immune system
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.900]   and on other systems of neural repair and synapses
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.580]   and things that really reinforce connections in the brain
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.460]   and prevent that long-term withering of connections.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.660]   So serotonin is tied to social connection.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.900]   Now, social connection can take many forms.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.840]   Some of those can be romantic attachments.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.740]   Those could be familial attachments
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.260]   that are non-romantic, friendship, pets,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.380]   even attachments to things that just delight us.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.300]   Having a sense of delight,
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.260]   a sense of really enjoying something that you see
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.360]   and engage in, witness, or participate in,
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.620]   that is associated with the serotonin system.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.500]   And certainly play is one of those things,
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.020]   social connection of various forms.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.660]   Those are things to invest in.
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.180]   I'll be the first to admit social connection and friendship
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.940]   and relationships of all kinds to animals or humans
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.940]   or inanimate objects takes work.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.980]   It takes investment.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.280]   It takes time in not needing everything
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.780]   to be exactly the way you want it to be.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.860]   Social connection is something that we work for,
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.380]   but it is incredibly powerful.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.260]   Finding just a few people, even one, or an animal,
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.420]   or something that you delight in, believe it or not,
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.780]   has very positive effects
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.620]   on mitigating this long-term stress,
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.940]   on improving various aspects of our life
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.660]   as it relates to stress and emotionality.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.500]   Now, how do you know if you're making serotonin?
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.020]   You don't know in the moment,
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.140]   but you can learn if you pay attention
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.940]   to kind of recognize these feelings of comfort,
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.700]   trust, bliss, delight.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.580]   And those are not weak terms.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.320]   Those are not associated just with psychological terms.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.860]   They are every bit as physiological
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.420]   as the movement of your muscles
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.860]   or the secretion of adrenaline.
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.380]   Now, there are a plethora of things
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.980]   that will also impact wellbeing
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.020]   and allow you to modulate your long-term stress,
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.100]   reduce the likelihood
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.240]   that you'll engage in long-term stress.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.420]   There are compounds that are not prescription compounds
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.280]   that can modulate the stress system.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.580]   And sometimes, because of the way that life is,
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.740]   we just don't have the opportunity to control life
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.380]   and to control our response to stress.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.580]   The three I want to focus on,
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.160]   and one that I think you need to be cautious about
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.860]   that I've mentioned before,
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:31.860]   include ashwagandha, l-theanine, and melatonin.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.620]   Let's talk about melatonin first.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.780]   Melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.440]   in direct relationship to how much darkness you are in,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.120]   not emotional darkness, but light suppresses melatonin.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.520]   Melatonin helps you fall asleep.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.880]   It doesn't help you stay asleep.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.440]   I personally do not recommend supplementing melatonin
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.040]   because it's supplemented typically at very high levels,
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.160]   you know, one to three milligrams or even more.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.360]   That is an outrageously high dose.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.520]   It also has a number of potentially negative effects
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.080]   on the reproductive axis and hormones there.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.180]   The other is l-theanine.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.820]   I've talked about l-theanine,
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.220]   which provided it's safe for you,
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.820]   can be taken 100 milligrams or 200 milligrams
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.860]   about a 30 minutes or 60 minutes before sleep.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.760]   It can enhance the transition to sleep
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.500]   and depth of sleep for many people.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.980]   It increases GABA, this inhibitory neurotransmitter
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.800]   in the brain.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.020]   It tends to turn off our forebrain a little bit
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.440]   or reduce the activity of our kind of thinking systems
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.940]   and ruminating systems help people fall asleep.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.540]   But theanine has also been shown for people
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.660]   that are chronically anxious or chronically stressed
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.520]   to significantly increase relaxation.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.820]   It is known to have a minor effect on anxiety,
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.540]   but eight studies have shown that.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.580]   It definitely has a notable effect on stress.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.980]   The other supplement that can be very useful is ashwagandha.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.880]   Ashwagandha is known to lower anxiety and cortisol.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.720]   This is great.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.660]   I mean, the opportunity for me anyway,
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.400]   to be able to take something
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.840]   that can help me reduce my cortisol
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.100]   so that I don't get some of the long-term effects of stress.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.080]   And I'm not going to take ashwagandha year round.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.520]   I would only do this if I was feeling like
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.520]   I wasn't managing my short and medium-term stress well.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.960]   So I don't take it on a regular basis.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.520]   I do take it when I'm in these times
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.560]   when things are particularly stressful.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.440]   So social connection and some supplementation,
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.040]   of course, diet, exercise, sleep for long-term stress.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.480]   So I hope today you were able to take
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.000]   a slightly different view of this thing that we call stress,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.160]   not just see it as evil,
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.080]   but see it as powerful and useful in certain contexts,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.000]   great for us in certain contexts,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.080]   and problematic in other contexts.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.120]   And as well to think about the various tools
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.520]   that I've presented that can allow you to adjust
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.240]   and modulate your internal levels of alertness or calmness
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.640]   so that you can lean more effectively into life,
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.320]   which includes sleep and social connection
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.040]   and the work you have to do.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.620]   And of course, acknowledges that the events in the world
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.060]   are beyond our control.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.120]   What's in our control is how we react to them.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.420]   Something that's commonly said in the wellness
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.000]   and self-help and psychology world,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.280]   but for which there often aren't as many concrete tools
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.240]   that we can really look to and trust in real time.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.920]   As always, really appreciate your time and attention today.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.840]   I hope you practice some of the tools
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.760]   if they're right for you.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.800]   I hope you think hard about stress
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.640]   and how you can control your stress.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.400]   And above all, as always,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.040]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.620]   [upbeat music]
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.200]   (upbeat music)
