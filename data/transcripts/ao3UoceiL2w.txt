[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   I mentioned soup in terms of progress.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.920]   There's been a little bit of tension,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.640]   a little bit of love online in terms of deep learning.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.080]   So I just wanted to say that the kind of criticism
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.280]   and skepticism about the limitations of deep learning
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.740]   are really healthy in moderation.
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.140]   Jeff Hinton, one of the three people
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.440]   to receive the Turing Award, as many people know,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.280]   has said that the future depends on some graduate student
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.160]   who is deeply suspicious of everything I have said.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.200]   So that suspicion, skepticism is essential,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.520]   but in moderation, just a little bit.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.040]   The more important thing is perseverance,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.000]   which is what Jeffrey Hinton and the others have had
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.080]   through the winters of believing in neural nets
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.320]   and an open-mindedness for returning to the world
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.560]   of symbolic AI, of expert systems,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.280]   of complexity and cellular automata,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.840]   of old ideas in AI and bringing them back
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.160]   and see if there's ideas there.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.080]   And of course, you have to have a little bit of crazy.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.760]   Nobody ever achieves something brilliant
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.520]   without being a little bit of crazy.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.920]   And the most important thing is a lot of hard work.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.640]   It's not the cool thing these days,
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.320]   but hard work is everything.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   I like what JFK said about us going to the moon, us.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320]   I was born in the Soviet Union.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.860]   See how I conveniently just said us?
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.460]   Going to the moon is, we do these things
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.100]   not because they're easy, but because they're hard.
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.200]   And I think that artificial intelligence
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.740]   is one of the hardest and most exciting problems
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.500]   that are before us.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.980]   So with that, I'd like to thank you
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.180]   and see if there's any questions.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.340]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:14.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
