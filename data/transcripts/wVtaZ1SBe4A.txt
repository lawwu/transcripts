[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   There can be 1,000 refugees from a country you don't like,
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.280]   you put it on the news and people say,
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.000]   "Oh, we just couldn't possibly absorb them,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   "we're at our absolute breaking point, this is terrible."
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.920]   On the other hand, you can have millions of refugees
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   come into your country, and if you like them
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.480]   and sympathize with them,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.960]   then it's all hunky-dory and it's fine.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.000]   Polish policy was also excellent.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.680]   Ukrainians are allowed to work the day they show up.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.080]   I mean, just to realize how amazing
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.320]   what they're doing in Poland is,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.480]   this would be like the U.S. took 33 million refugees
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.320]   in a month.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.720]   Americans freak out over 10,000.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.720]   So just to realize how phony and bogus the complaints are,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.760]   and it really is just a matter of believing and seeing.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.520]   If you think that refugees are bad
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.400]   or that immigrants are bad,
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.760]   you will see bad things happening.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.180]   And on the other hand, if you're supportive
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.640]   and have a can-do attitude, then you'll say,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.080]   "Hey, this is completely doable."
