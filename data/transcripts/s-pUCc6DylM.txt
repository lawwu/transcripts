[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Podcast listener Sheldon writes in to ask this,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   "I would consider myself a Christian hedonist, and I'm familiar with the scriptures that extol God's own happiness.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   However, when I observe God interacting with humans in scripture, such as Jesus in the Gospels, or God with Israel in the Old Testament,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   He often does not come across as outwardly happy.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Am I just reading it wrong? Was Jesus' time on earth just full of hardship?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   How can I address this seeming disconnect between biblical theology that exclaims God's full unending joy,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   with this biblical observation of God in His actions, His speech, His behavior, that seem to show Him as not all that abounding in joy?"
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Well, Sheldon, I found this to be one of the most provocative questions I've heard, had in a long time.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   This really forced me to ponder some things that I hadn't thought of before, so thank you.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   It's just a great example of how asking questions is the key to going deeper in the Bible and what we think.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   So, I don't know that I have the answer here, but I'll tell you what I've been thinking about.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Let's start with the truth that we Christians are joyful and sorrowful at the same time.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   2 Corinthians 6:10, "Sorrowful yet always rejoicing."
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Even though the Bible says, "Rejoice always, and surely God rejoices always,"
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   we sorrow often, maybe always, because it's always something to be sad about, without losing our joy.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Now, I think it's this way with God.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   God can be grieved, Ephesians 4.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   He's angry, and He sympathizes with the sorrowful, weeps with those who weep,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   even while laughing at the wicked, Psalm 2, and rejoicing over sinners who repent, Luke 15.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So God is very emotionally complex, infinitely more so than we are, but we're emotionally complex, too, in His image.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So, let me try an analogy of God's peaceful, joyful, Trinitarian happiness.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It's like the Pacific Ocean.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   From a satellite, it is perfectly beautiful and serene and blue.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   You've seen those pictures, the blue planet.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It just looks wonderful.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   But if you're flying in a helicopter 500 feet above the waves in a hurricane,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   the Pacific Ocean is frighteningly and terrifyingly turbulent.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And that's the way, I think, the mind of God is.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Another way to see it is that God sometimes looks at our lives through the narrow lens that focuses on our sin or our pain,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and He can be angry or grieved.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's that Jesus looked around on them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart in Mark 3, I think.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So grief and anger happening together.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I think God can feel that when He looks through the narrow lens at your life.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Or He can open the lens to the wider aperture and see our sin and our pain in relationship to the whole panorama of His millions of purposes
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and approve of the tapestry that He's weaving in history, including our own pain and sin in it,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   and thus rejoice over all His works.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So He can be looking through the wide lens and rejoicing, looking through the narrow lens and grieving and suffering.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And my answer to the question that he's asking is that in the Bible,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   what we have mainly is a record of God dealing with us in our sin and pain and looking largely through the narrow lens.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   That's what the Bible is.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's between the fall and the consummation where the Bible mostly records God's interaction with man in rebellion,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   in sin, before the final day, which I think accounts for why the tone is so regularly bleak and agonizing and struggling and grieving and painful.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   There are hundreds of glimpses of God's joy and our joy in the age to come when we are done with sinning.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   But mostly the Bible is the story of our sinning and God's painful and merciful dealing with it.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   God enters into our pain-filled world in Jesus, and He's called a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So He's a high priest who can sympathize with us in our sorrows and in our pain.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I mean, that's what we would expect is that this man who came into the world precisely to suffer is going to look like a sufferer
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   almost every time we see him rather than a person who's chipper all the time,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   even though he went to parties and they called him a glutton and a wine-bibber.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   He was sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So it seems to me that the very problem that has been raised is a good news problem.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   God is not distant off in His Trinitarian happiness but is identifying with us in our sorrow.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   The God we meet in the Bible is a God revealing Himself not usually as before creation in perfect Trinitarian happiness
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   or after consummation when all sinning is gone and all evil has been put out of the universe,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   but God with us now agonizing over His recalcitrant bride Israel in the Old Testament
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and in His Son suffering for us in the new.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But I would end my effort to answer this question, Tony, by saying,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   let's not forget all the places, and I have never counted them, but there are a lot,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   where God Himself reminds us, "The ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Everlasting joy will be upon their heads.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   They shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and sighing will flee away."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And that means not only ours, but God's identification with ours will also flee away,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   and there won't be any of this kind of cloud hanging over the universe like there is now.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Yes, and Lord hasten that day. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
