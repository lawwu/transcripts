[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam and Cindy from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, we
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.000]   want to talk about the best reason to retire early, which is years and years of greater
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.080]   happiness. And I don't think retiring early just provides years and years of greater happiness.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.800]   It also provides an earlier rebound in happiness, and a higher peak level of happiness. So I
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.440]   didn't really discover or realize, come to this epiphany until recently. And it's been
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.400]   over 10 years since I left my job in 2012. And only now do I see the light. After 45
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.280]   years on earth, after more than 10 years of early retirement, I see the biggest benefit
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.400]   is greater happiness. In the past, well, at least in the earlier years, I wrote about
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.040]   how early retirement isn't all sunshine and rainbows. I went through plenty of struggles
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.960]   trying to find meaning and purpose during my first two years, post traditional work.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.440]   And I've also encountered plenty of miserable rich people. They have a few money, they can
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.480]   do whatever they want by any nice car, any nice home, fly private, whatever it is. But
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.840]   yet, they still don't seem completely happy, because they're always comparing themselves
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.680]   to those with more. It's almost like they're their permanent black cloud. Years ago, I
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.440]   stumbled across this very famous American Time Use Survey chart. And it charts life
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.720]   satisfaction or happiness by age. And you start off at about a seven and a half, and
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.400]   it plummets down to the pit of uncertainty and the unknown, which is at around 6.7, when
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.520]   you're about 20 to 22 years old. And then it creeps back up to a plateau of when you're
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.040]   30 years old, and then it flatlines until about 52 years old, kind of dips down, and
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.240]   then it increases up, up, up until about 72. And then it kind of declines until you die.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.080]   So that's kind of what we've seen before. And I really didn't pay much attention to
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.240]   it because I was just too young and eager to make my money and make my mark in life.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.480]   But now that I'm 45 years old, I see the meaning of the charts so clearly now, please
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.360]   click over to the show notes and to the post to see the chart for yourself. Life satisfaction
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.480]   improves for most people once their lives become simpler and more secure, financially
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.040]   secure in particular. So Sydney, what are your thoughts on happiness by age? Do you
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.800]   believe in this chart? And how has your happiness risen and fallen over the years and particularly
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.960]   since I guess you retired in 2015? I think my chart is very similar to what's pictured
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.760]   just at a shifted age range. So I definitely started out low with a lot of uncertainty
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.440]   in my career. And then as I got stable, it my happiness did plateau was just kind of
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.360]   every day was the same. There was different stresses involved, but my happiness wasn't
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.480]   significantly high or low, it was just kind of in the middle. And then once I left my
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.720]   traditional job, I definitely felt like my happiness went up. Can you quantify the numbers
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.520]   like while you were working? What was it out of 10? While I was working on some days, it
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.160]   was probably like a five other days, maybe it was a six, seven. So it's just kind of,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.080]   you know, plodding along. And then after 2015, I would say it's definitely been above an
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.440]   eight. Wow, above an eight. Yeah, it's pretty high. I think so. I think I'm pretty happy.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.040]   I think I'm happier than you on most days because I'm permanently smiling. I often walk
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.600]   down the street and people smile back and I'm thinking to myself, why are you smiling
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.120]   me and then I really strong facial muscles. I think Yeah, I guess so. I don't know. But
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.960]   I think smiling a lot. Yeah. Yeah. You know, quick pro tip, life tip, just smile more.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.140]   It's free. It's easy. And it actually tricks our brain into thinking that we're happy even
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.920]   if we're faking it. I learned that. And then maybe you overcome the fake to actually turn
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.140]   into a happier person. There you go. So it's good to hear that you were happier after retiring.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.400]   For me, I was happier too. But I felt a lot of uncertainty for the first six months from
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.120]   2012 to 2013. Because I wasn't sure whether this was the right thing to do. And you're
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   also doing it alone. When I when I left, I had you and we were doing it as a team. So
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.280]   you didn't feel as uncertain after you retired early? No. What about money? What about your
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.000]   career aspirations? You know, what are hopes and dreams in terms of my career? I I did.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.360]   I did everything that I wanted to add that job. So I didn't feel like I was leaving anything
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.160]   on the table. I didn't want to stay and try to become my boss. I saw what he was doing
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.160]   and the types of stress that he had. And I did not want that. So I I left at what I consider
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.960]   my high point, which I think is a good thing. And I knew that the next phase of career,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.680]   I wouldn't call myself retired. I'd call myself semi retired, was just going to provide a
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.880]   lot more flexibility and more opportunities to use my creative side, which I was really
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.640]   excited about. Can you provide some examples of the creative side you're talking about?
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.560]   Sure. So writing, doing editorial work, also a lot of parenting, which involves a lot of
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.760]   creativity and patience. So I had I had, you know, a lot of my life in parent, like in
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.200]   the depths of parenthood after I left traditional work. And I think that's also why my happiness
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.760]   was higher. Yeah, it is definitely hard. But it also brought a lot of joy and new adventures
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.320]   into my day to day and yours, too. Yeah. Well, let's talk about this creative side for a
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.920]   minute, because let's say there was no writing or editing, anything to do with financial
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.120]   samurai at all. Would you still be as happy? I think so. Well, what other creative things
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.920]   would you do if I had all the energy and time in the world? Maybe I would create some kind
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:28.120]   of organization, business or something to do with landscaping. But obviously, that's
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.400]   not something that I want to actually turn into a career. But you put me on the spot.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   So that's just the two creative things that came to the top of my mind. I think I think
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   most listeners in terms of retiring early, I mean, the biggest fear of retiring early
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.520]   is not having enough money, not, you know, running out of money. And that was my anxiety
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.400]   for a long time. And then that anxiety kicked in again in 2017. After our son was born,
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.640]   even though we had enough passive income to cover our expenses, I think there's like a
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.040]   DNA component to parents, maybe to fathers in particular, that we've got to go out there
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.160]   and forage and hunt and earn money. So I'm just curious from a female's point of view,
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.400]   father's point of view, the correlation with money, stress and happiness, I just want to
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   learn more from you. Well, I feel like now that we've, we've, you know, been together
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.640]   for so long, I don't view our finances as, you know, only mine and only yours. Sure,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.880]   we still have separate bank accounts. But I feel like we're a combined team, because
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.960]   there are a lot of things that we do together as a team in terms of our, our financial goals,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.120]   our savings goals and investing. And I, it's not like I was starting my retirement with
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.920]   nothing, right? I had all the money that I've been saving and investing throughout my career.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.600]   So I didn't feel like, you know, how am I going to buy groceries today? I have nothing
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.720]   in my bank account. I didn't have those kinds of fears. And thanks to your insights along
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.520]   the way, you know, I've been able to build passive income streams of my own. So, you
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.160]   know, I have that money coming in as well. And it's not like I was planning on never
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.840]   working ever again. I'm working part time and generating value to the business. Yeah,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.600]   that's right. And I think it's great that we have something intellectual to do, which
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.960]   is, you know, write and edit, writing books and podcasting, figuring out all the back
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.520]   end stuff that happens behind the scenes as well. That takes a lot of brainpower. Sometimes,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.760]   you know, running a website's not as easy as it may seem sometimes. Yeah. And that's
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.600]   the thing, folks, when you listen to a podcast or see creatives do work, there's a lot, there's
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.160]   tons of behind the scenes work that needs to be done. So it seems seamless, so that
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.400]   the end production value is what you hear, which is generally usually flawless. Well,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.520]   not flawless, but really good enough. And so let's give some support and a round of
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.200]   shout outs to people who take the time to create and take risks. Based on your feedback,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   Cindy, it seems to me that happiness after retirement or before retirement increases
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.880]   if you have someone, if you have a teammate, if you can rely on someone, you're rock, who
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.560]   will never let you down. Because if I like, I don't know, it's one of those things where
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.360]   yeah, if you have, I don't know, a trust fund or family wealth, whatever, will that make
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:30.680]   you happy? I don't think it'll make you happy. I think it'll make you comfortable. And hopefully,
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:37.960]   maybe it'll enable you to take more risks. But what I'm trying to say is, life is probably
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.840]   less happy and harder if you're alone. Oh, yeah, for sure. So let's say hypothetically,
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.200]   I was not around to grind all those years after you left work in 2015. You know, you
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.480]   only had to rely on yourself. I was not in the picture. Do you think your stress or happiness
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.640]   level will be would have been different? Yeah, of course, it would be different. My whole
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.840]   life would be very, very different. If I was alone at that time, would I have a lot more
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.000]   fear? Certainly. You know, I wouldn't. If I was by myself, and you know, FS wasn't a
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.600]   part of the picture, then I would have, you know, a lot, a lot harder time figuring out
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:24.120]   how I could work independently, for sure. That'd be a very, very different experience.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.400]   Right. I think it's just, I'm just trying to understand the differences with men and
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.880]   women. That's really fascinating to me. I actually felt tremendous stress at some point
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.720]   after 2012 to be a provider, and it was after our son was born. And I felt, you know, stressed
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.440]   with the pandemic, in terms of protecting our children from an unknown enemy, invisible
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:55.280]   enemy. And but now I don't feel as stressed anymore. I've decided to take things easier.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.640]   I've tried, I've decided to throttle my efforts. Because I'm just tired. And I think we have
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:09.320]   enough money. And what do you think about the importance of matching efforts in a relationship?
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.720]   I think it's really important. It also goes back to having a partner that you share financial
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:22.320]   values with. I think a lot of marriages and partnerships run into trouble when, when a
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.960]   team's financial goals are too divergent from each other. And it can just create so much
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.360]   stress and tension. So the closer aligned two people are with their finances and their
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.200]   career goals and any kind of goal, and for that matter, I think the better things tend
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.800]   to turn out, don't you think? I think so. Yeah, alignment is really important. It's
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.700]   one of those things where you don't want to take an eight hour road trip with your best
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.640]   friend because you might end up killing each other, because something is eventually going
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:02.840]   to be misaligned. So relationships take work, alignment takes work. I'm curious, you know,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   over the past 20 plus years that I've known you, when were you the least happy?
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:15.480]   The least happy was during certain phases of the last job that I had, because the stress
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:22.040]   that I went through was immense. I was doing a lot of project oriented work. And there
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   was so much pressure on me to figure out how to solve a bunch of problems. And if I couldn't
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.760]   figure it out, then not only was I letting down my boss and my teammate, but I was also
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:39.120]   letting down a client. And that impacted a lot of things. It impacted, you know, my,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:47.320]   my employer's business significantly. So I just had so much weight and pressure on me
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.540]   at certain times. And it was really, really hard to go through that for long stretches
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:13:00.360]   of time. Right. One of the best reasons to retire early is you can escape from toxic
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.840]   people or people who bring you down or don't appreciate you or expect you to work like
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.360]   a dog with no commensurate reward. Yeah, I could see that. Speaking of no commensurate
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:19.600]   reward, I recorded over 100 episodes of the Financial Samurai podcast since 2017 with
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.680]   no financial reward. Did you know that? I did not. Yeah, I've gotten no sponsors. I
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.680]   haven't looked for sponsors. Yeah, I've I've mentioned affiliate partners before, as well
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.960]   as my book, but there's no specific sponsor for the Financial Samurai podcast. And I've
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.320]   done that on purpose because I wanted to go light to be able to go far. I didn't want
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.240]   to have to negotiate business development deals and negotiate rates and all that I just
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.640]   wanted to record. And I like to communicate and share our thoughts and feelings in a different
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.040]   medium. So this is something that's really important for those of you who are working
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:59.080]   now or who want to retire early, definitely retire to something that you enjoy doing,
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:04.320]   that there might not be any money involved. I write because I enjoy communicating. I like
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.840]   to do this podcast because I hope one day our children will be able to listen to what
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.320]   mom and dad said during the pandemic, pre pandemic, post pandemic, I think it'd be wonderful
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.600]   for them. Yeah. And we're just going to continue to do this because we enjoy the work. I would
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.920]   say my happiness today is about an eight out of 10. I'm happier because the pandemic has
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:31.160]   died down and our daughter is three. So based on our experience with our son, between the
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.200]   ages of three and five is when my anxiety decline about him hurting himself all the
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.080]   time. Now we can, you know, let her be for, it's not as scary to get out of the playground.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.120]   We can just kind of kick back a little more or just letting her be by herself in a room.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.680]   Maybe she's not going to like ingest. I didn't tell you this, but she almost clogged her
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.720]   toilet the other day. She was in the bathroom and I was doing something and the other room
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.500]   and I was like, wait a minute, it's too quiet. What's going on? And I went in there and she
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.280]   had stuffed about half a roll of toilet paper in the toilet and thank God she hadn't tried
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.920]   to flush it yet. So I was able to save that disaster from happening, but she didn't hurt
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:18.400]   herself, but she can still cause mayhem. Yes. But yeah. So hopefully she won't swallow that
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.440]   metal ball or anything and just fall off a cliff and all that. Anyway, so I'm happier
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.720]   because I'm less worried about our children. Our daughter is specifically hurting herself.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.920]   I'm happier because our son is happy to go to school every day, which is the most a parent
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:40.920]   could hope for. I'm hypersensitive to bullying. I remember growing up in a really bully atmosphere
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.520]   in Taiwan, Malaysia, in Northern Virginia, and maybe it's just me. I'm always getting
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.920]   the fights, but I think it's always because I'm sticking up for myself. Like you can hit
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.360]   me and I will feel the pain. I'll take that pain, but I'm going to hit you back if you
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.440]   come for me. So I've had that kind of attitude my entire life. I don't demur to aggression.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.680]   So this is going to be interesting as our kids get older. How are they going to deal
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:11.640]   with hardships and conflicts? I'm also happier because we go play pickleball once or twice
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:17.040]   a week when both our children are in school full time, which is right now, Tuesday and
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.160]   Thursday, and it might shift to Monday, Wednesday, Friday in the fall of this year. So we have
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.660]   more free time. And here's something interesting. So most of the pickleball players we play
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.600]   with are in their sixties or older. Yeah, definitely. Their children are adults and
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.000]   they seem pretty happy. They seem worry free. And some of them bring their children to play
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.400]   and they seem really happy. And while on the pickleball court, it also feels like I've
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.840]   transported 20 years ahead while still having the fitness of a 45 year old. So it almost
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:52.160]   feels like cheating a little. Like I feel like we're both retired kind of, but I'm 20
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.960]   years younger, so I'm going to be able to womp on them on the court. Yeah, that's true.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:03.520]   I don't look at it that way with the people I'm playing with. I'm playing with like, you
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:11.040]   know, nice retired teachers and whatnot. But I look at it as, you know, as a fun way to
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:17.440]   get to know friends through the game and also get, you know, insight into the wisdom that
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:23.920]   they've learned in those 20 years that we haven't lived yet. Yeah. Yeah. Just my competitive
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:30.020]   nature. I'm thinking, hmm, best reason to retire early is to gain this unfair physical
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:37.160]   competitive advantage to do more fun activities before our health fades. Our health will inevitably
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:43.280]   fade. So it almost is kind of like cheat mode, you know, to fast forward in time, let's say
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.360]   when we're 65 years old, but to have the physical fitness of a 45 year old or younger. Yeah.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:56.000]   I mean, especially as an athlete for you, I can definitely see how great that is. And
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.640]   for me too, just I'm not in really into sports, but just still being able to do fun things
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.320]   that do require being physically healthy are great because both of my parents are in their
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:14.600]   seventies now and man, they are in a lot of trouble, like health wise, they just have
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.160]   so many ailments and aches. And, um, you know, when I was looking at the happiness chart,
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.880]   I was like, yeah, they unfortunately didn't get that peak of happiness, you know, after
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.480]   they retired, I feel like they just had too many health issues. So being able to cheat
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:37.160]   that early, um, can definitely lead to more happiness. So I think everybody, it's important
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:45.280]   to stay active, eat properly, and don't just wing it. You've got to take action to consistently
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:53.600]   stay active, be in the sun an hour a day, go for walks, stay physically active because,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.080]   you know, our health is everything. Our health is everything. What is that great saying?
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.680]   A sick man only wants one thing. A healthy man wants everything. Basically, if you don't
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.200]   have your health, you just want your health and nothing else matters. I think it's also
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.760]   important to diversify our happiness. You know, the people who retire or retire early
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:22.360]   and who are in the most trouble had too much of their identity wrapped up in their job.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.600]   You know, they too much recognition, desire for recognition day to day, no, not as many
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.000]   hobbies or no hobbies, no, you know, people they hang out with. It was just all about
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.560]   their job. And so when they lose that through retirement or otherwise, there's more hardship.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.720]   And for you, I feel like you didn't really like your job. So you're, you're happy to
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.280]   leave towards the end. Yeah, it was just becoming too much for me. And for me, I loved my job
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.160]   for the first, let's say, nine, 10 years, and then financial crisis hit. And then the
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.560]   correlation with effort and reward didn't correlate anymore. And then there's too many
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:05.360]   office politics and you know, the business suffered. So it was not wasn't as fun. So
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.640]   I think diversifying your sources of happiness is important. So right now, I think it's very,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.400]   very important. We don't just focus on our children for our source of happiness, because
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:21.240]   our children will inevitably have rough times. There's another great saying, our happiness
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:27.200]   is only as great as the sadness of our least happy child or something like that. Our happiness
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:35.040]   is only as happy as our least happy child. Okay. And the reason why is because when our
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.760]   children are in pain or hurt, we feel that pain, right? We absorb all of that. So currently,
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:47.120]   I'm trying to diversify my sources of happiness through pickleball, to try to be the best
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.960]   pickleball player I can be. And also, as an author, I plan to write a second book and
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:58.880]   a third book to come up with that wonderful all time classic bestseller that will be backlisted
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.680]   for decades to come. I think that's gonna be a fun challenge. It's a daunting challenge.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:10.400]   But those are my sources of happiness, family, creativity and athletics. How about you? What
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:17.040]   are your diverse sources of happiness? Family is obviously a huge one. Pickleball is
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:25.200]   my newest one from November of last year. And then volunteering at school, which is
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.960]   still kind of related to kids, but I definitely love doing that and being involved with the
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:37.680]   schools. And I also would throw gardening out there. Deweeding is my fun way of meditating
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:44.160]   and getting fresh air and making the yard look good. Oh, sounds good. It's good diversification.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:50.480]   Finally, I want to leave you all with my one word definition of happiness. And that's progress.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   So long as you're making progress, whatever it is in your relationship, in your profession,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:05.600]   in your business, with your children, you're happy. But as soon as you stop making progress,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.040]   something has to change. You have to mix things up. You've got to try something new in order
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.760]   to get that progress back. Because if you're coasting, right, there's another saying if
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:21.000]   you're coasting, you're going downhill. And when you're going downhill, that's not a direction
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.520]   that most of us want to feel. Yeah. Feeling happy is priceless, folks. If you're miserable
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:32.800]   at your job, then retiring earlier or taking on a better job for less pay is absolutely
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:39.720]   worth it. I know it's hard to quit the money. I know it's hard to quit maximum money. But
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:45.000]   the problem is there's always more money to make. And there's never another second to
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.240]   create. So if you're on the fence about retiring early or taking things easier, and you have
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.960]   enough savings and enough passive income, at least you're on the right direction. I
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.320]   would take that leap, you will find something you enjoy doing. And inevitably, I think you're
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.720]   going to find something you enjoy doing that will also pay you some money in the process.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:13.560]   There is that term, this term called ikigai, which is to do what you love, to do what the
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.000]   world needs to do what you're good at, and to get paid for doing what you love and you're
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.680]   good at. And so if you can find that it really will bring up that happiness level and reduce
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.000]   the amount of grits you will feel in your life. So thanks so much, everyone for listening
