[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.280]   - Amy, a daily podcast listener from Omaha, Nebraska,
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.760]   my hometown, writes in to ask this,
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.820]   I understand hell to be the absence of God,
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.880]   but of course he is omnipresent.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.680]   If God is everywhere, is he also in hell?
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.140]   What do you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.020]   - There are at least two important responses
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.960]   to Amy's question.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.880]   One is to say, yes,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.400]   hell is that, hell is the absence of God,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   and we need to answer in what sense
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.080]   is he absent or present.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.360]   But the other response is to say that hell is,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.680]   as it's described in the Bible,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.820]   is terribly more than the absence of God.
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.140]   So let me deal with each of those just a little bit.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.040]   Yes, hell is the absence of God.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.820]   Here's 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9.
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.480]   The Lord will be revealed from heaven
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840]   with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.460]   inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.360]   and on those who do not obey the gospel.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.800]   They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.880]   away from the presence of the Lord
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.440]   and from the glory of his might.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.620]   So yes, yes, yes, hell is away
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.520]   from the presence of the Lord
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.920]   and from the glory of his might.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.880]   So the promise of Psalm 1611 will not come true in hell.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.640]   In your presence, there's fullness of joy.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.920]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.000]   No, because his presence like that won't be there.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.680]   Or the prayer of Jesus in John 17
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.000]   is not going to be answered in hell
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.080]   when Jesus prayed, "I desire that they also
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.560]   "whom you have given me may be with me,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.340]   "where I am, to see my glory that you have given me
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.300]   "before the foundation of the world,
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.760]   "and that the love with which you have loved me
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.640]   "may be in them and I am them."
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.920]   That's not gonna happen in hell.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.360]   In hell, the all-satisfying beauty of God
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   for which our hearts were made will not be seen.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.320]   The love that flows from it will not be known.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   And the pleasures forevermore and the fullness of joy
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.020]   won't be experienced.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.380]   All that will be absent.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.780]   So the meaning of away from the presence of the Lord
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.520]   does not mean that God is absent in every sense,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.180]   but in those senses.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.180]   God will be terribly present in another sense.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.420]   All reality continues to say,
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.920]   "In him we live and move and have our being,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.480]   "and it is still in hell that no one can hide
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.920]   "from the Lord or escape
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.040]   "the terrible countenance of his anger."
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.960]   So God's power is present in hell
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.340]   as the one who sustains our being
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.900]   and the one who enforces justice
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.620]   and the one who maintains suffering.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.580]   He is present in all the ways men do not want him
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.200]   to be present and none of the ways
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.160]   that believers enjoy his presence.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.140]   Which brings us to this second thing just briefly.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.140]   Hell is more than the absence of God.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.180]   And I feel the need to say that.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.180]   I don't know whether Amy meant to imply that.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.000]   I hope not.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.080]   But some people do.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.720]   Some people do want to say we're annihilated.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.160]   And of course, there's no presence of God
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.340]   'cause we don't exist and nobody exists after,
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.300]   or that it's just some kind of deprivation
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.760]   and nothing positive by way of suffering.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.220]   That just won't work.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.620]   Matthew 10, 28, Jesus said,
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.700]   "Fear him who can destroy soul and body in hell."
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.940]   So the body's gonna be tormented
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.980]   and the soul is going to be tormented.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.680]   Matthew 25, 46, "These will go away
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.920]   "into eternal punishment."
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.880]   Punishment.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.800]   But the righteous into eternal life.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.740]   Revelation 14, "If anyone worships the beast,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.220]   "its image, and receives a mark on his forehead,
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.380]   "he will drink the wine of God's wrath
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.340]   "poured full strength into the cup of his anger.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.500]   "And he will be tormented with fire and sulfur
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.460]   "in the presence of the holy angels
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.140]   "and in the presence of the Lamb.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.800]   "And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.520]   "and there is no rest day or night."
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.220]   So it is a present torment
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.220]   with fire and restlessness.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.540]   Or Mark 9, 43, "It is better for you to enter life crippled
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.940]   "than with two hands to go to hell,
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.160]   "to the unquenchable fire."
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.380]   Or Mark 9, 47, "It's better for you to enter
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.060]   "the kingdom of God with one eye
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.640]   "than with two to be thrown into hell
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.980]   "where their worm does not die
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.400]   "and the fire is not quenched."
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   So, Amy, hell is a horrible and fearful thing
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   which teaches us that our sin is a horrible
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.120]   and fearful thing and God's holiness
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.120]   is a horrible and fearful thing to be opposed by.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.040]   And the cross of Christ who endured hell
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.120]   for all his people for all time
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.120]   is the most precious event in the history of the world.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.760]   - Yes, it sure is.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.640]   So election is real and hell is real
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   and that led to one of our podcast listeners
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.840]   named James to write in and ask,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.480]   "How does it glorify God to predestine people to hell?"
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.800]   It's a sober question and it's a question we address
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.880]   in episode number 52 of this podcast series.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.160]   Well, we are all familiar with failures,
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.960]   big failures and little failures.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.940]   And Monday we will look at how the Bible helps us
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.960]   to think of those failures.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.960]   Until then, please visit us online at desiringgod.org

[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.680]   and all intended to help explain
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.540]   why God is most glorified in us
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.920]   when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.240]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.820]   (upbeat music)
