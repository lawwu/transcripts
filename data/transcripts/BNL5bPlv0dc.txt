[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Could you define 2020 vision and a few of the variants
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   so that any person could understand it?
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.520]   So we think of 2020 as perfect vision.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.680]   What does that mean?
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.060]   What would degraded vision look like?
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.880]   Whatever those numbers are.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.160]   And then what would above normal,
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.040]   supra normal vision look like?
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.240]   And is it true that fighter pilots have supra normal vision?
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.320]   - Yeah, that's another population like many athletes
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.640]   of people who may have sort of better than normal vision.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.320]   2020, we define almost everything we do
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.320]   based on kind of a average, not sick human being,
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.680]   adult, whatever it is, right?
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.180]   And so 2020 vision means that you can read
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.380]   the smallest letters at 20 feet away
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.380]   that the average healthy person can read at 20 feet away.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.760]   So you can read at 20 what they can read at 20, okay?
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.520]   Now, if you have worse than 2020 vision,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.320]   maybe you have 2025 vision, 2040 vision,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.360]   maybe you have 2200 vision,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.360]   which on the eye chart at the office
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.360]   is like the big E at the very top is 2200 vision.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.680]   That means you can read at 20 feet
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.520]   what a normal person could read at 200 feet, right?
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.600]   So you've got pretty limited lower vision.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.440]   We can measure down to like 2400, 2800.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.120]   At that point, we're getting into like,
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.240]   gosh, can you count how many fingers I'm holding up?
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.320]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.720]   And then ultimately hand motion,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.640]   can you even tell if my hand is moving
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.440]   in this side of your vision or this side of your vision?
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.960]   And then ultimately after that light perception,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.720]   can you tell if the room lights are on or off, right?
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.560]   And that's kind of the edge of being actually fully blind.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.640]   We call legal blindness in the United States
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.120]   typically 2200 or worse.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.760]   - And is it true that there are people
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.200]   who are legally blind that are out there driving
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.680]   as we're having this conversation?
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.240]   - I have to imagine that that is unfortunately the case,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.360]   but it shouldn't be because those people obviously
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.000]   are really severely impaired
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.400]   and that's obviously quite dangerous.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.840]   So that's 2020.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.200]   Now it gets worse, 2040, 2080, 2100.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.040]   Can it get better?
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.600]   Yeah, it turns out that people can be sort of
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.960]   on the other end of that curve.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.600]   And so we could have athletes and fighter pilots
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.400]   or people who have had LASIK surgery who are 2015, 2010.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.240]   If you're 2010, that means you can see at 20 feet
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.760]   what the average person needs to be
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.400]   only 10 feet away to see, right?
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.080]   And so you've got better than normal vision.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.200]   And people do get to that through a variety of ways.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.480]   And so it is possible to have better than 2020 vision.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.920]   - Does the degree of visual acuity,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.000]   'cause that's really what we're talking about here,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.160]   differ dramatically between the two eyes?
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.720]   - In most healthy people, no.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.800]   Remember we talked about you're born
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.680]   with something like 2200 vision,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.880]   takes you a couple of years
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.760]   and it can be a little bit asymmetric.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.360]   - 2200 vision.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.720]   Yeah, that reminds me,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.160]   I've seen images of what babies can see.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.000]   Parents love looking at their child
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and thinking that their child is looking right back at them.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.480]   And indeed, often the child is looking right back at them.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.640]   And your face to your child,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.080]   sorry to break this to you folks,
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.560]   is incredibly blurry, even at that close distance
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.400]   for probably the first six to eight months even
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.840]   before you come into sharp relief.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.520]   They're not seeing the fine details of your face.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.680]   So smile big.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.960]   - That's right, smile big.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.040]   Keep those eyebrows dark.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.640]   - Right, and keep cooing at them
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.160]   'cause they can hear pretty well.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.000]   - That's right.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.960]   - Yeah, the optics of newborn babies are just dreadfully bad
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.560]   but they need visuals to know.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   - Now other species, hawks, raptors, owls that hunt,
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   they can naturally have 2010, 28 vision, right?
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.160]   So much better vision.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.240]   And that's just their normal vision
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.800]   as best as has been measured.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.240]   So there's definitely the potential
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.720]   for us to have better than 2020 vision.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.840]   Now, all of this we call visual acuity.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.360]   And just to be clear for everyone,
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.160]   that's the vision in the very center of your vision.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.880]   Like when you're reading or looking,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.600]   that's the very center of your vision.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.960]   Our vision is actually described
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.080]   variably as a hill of vision.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.920]   The peak is in the center.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.120]   That's let's say 2020 in most people, right?
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.000]   But it's normal to have that slope off.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.280]   And our visual acuity,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.000]   your ability to read the eye chart
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.640]   on the edges of your vision,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.000]   if you can read the big E, that's pretty normal.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.880]   Like you would be 2200 out on the edges of your vision
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.960]   and we would feel like, yep, that's pretty normal.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.280]   So our highest acuity vision's in the center.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.520]   And that's a big part of why we spend a lot of time
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.000]   using those eye muscles to look around, right?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.920]   We gotta get a little bit of a high acuity view
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.280]   of what's around us, fill in the gaps
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.160]   of what our brain is interpreting
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   our peripheral world to look like.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.960]   (upbeat music)
