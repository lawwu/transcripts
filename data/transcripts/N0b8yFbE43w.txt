[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   As you can imagine, we get a lot of questions in the inbox about heaven and eternity and what to
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.680]   expect there. The most recent question in the inbox comes from a listener named Michael, who
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.000]   asks this very simply, "Pastor John, in heaven, will we be permitted to do anything that we want?"
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.760]   The answer is yes. So should we go on to the next question?
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.400]   Nice try.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.320]   Okay, okay. A simple yes could be misleading if I didn't say more. So here's the more.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.240]   Another way to say yes is that in heaven, that is in the age to come,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:46.320]   when there will be no more pain, no more sorrow, no more sin, those who've trusted in Jesus will
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.920]   experience for the first time complete and perfect freedom. Jesus said, "If the Son sets you free,
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.240]   you will be free indeed." And Paul said, "For freedom, Christ has set you free." And only
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.520]   Christians will enjoy complete and perfect freedom, which I have often defined this way,
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.840]   doing whatever you want to do and not regretting it in a thousand years.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:27.920]   Now let me see if I can help us feel the wonder of this by describing four stages of freedom.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:37.200]   And only the last stage is perfect freedom, and we only have it in heaven, and we will have it
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.960]   in heaven. The four stages are freedom of opportunity to do what we can, freedom of
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:56.400]   ability to do what we desire, freedom of enjoying what we desire while we do it, and the freedom
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   of enjoying what we desire forever because it is good and leads to no regret. Now here's the
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.480]   illustration, just one illustration for all four of these. Let's take skydiving, for example.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.160]   Suppose you are on your way to the airport to go to your first real jump. You've been studying it,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.720]   you've done everything except jump, and you're ready, and it's scheduled. Your car hits a
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.360]   pothole, I'm thinking Minnesota, you have a blowout, and you run into a telephone pole,
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.120]   and you're no longer free to jump that afternoon. Whether you have the ability to or desire to,
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.480]   doesn't matter. You don't have the opportunity because you're sitting in your car waiting for
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.720]   a tow truck. So you don't have the freedom of opportunity. Or suppose you make it to the
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.840]   airport, but you have no ability at all. Suppose in a different situation, you've never studied
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.720]   skydiving and never learned the first thing about how a parachute works. So the opportunity is there,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.760]   but you don't have the freedom of ability. You're in bondage to your lack of knowledge.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.280]   But third, suppose that you make it to the airport, you've been to school, you've been
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.000]   trained and have all the abilities you need, and you take off for your first jump. But as soon as
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.240]   you look down, all your desire vanishes, and in its place comes a tremendous fear. The opportunity
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.160]   is there, the ability is there, the know-how, but you don't have any desire anymore. The freedom,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:48.080]   the freedom of desire is gone. Now, there's one last requirement for full freedom. Suppose you
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.560]   get to the airport, no obstacle. You have all the know-how necessary. You look down at the tiny
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.800]   little clusters of silos and barns and farmhouses, and you just can't wait to jump. All the desire is
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.760]   there. And so you have the freedom of opportunity. You have the freedom of ability. You have the
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:16.320]   freedom of desire. So you jump and you fall a long way without pulling the cord. And unbeknownst to
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:26.160]   you, your parachute is not going to open. It's going to fail and you're going to die. Are you
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.760]   free before you know that? Well, in three senses you are, but in the critical fourth sense, you're
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:42.080]   not. What you are doing so happily, all the opportunity is there, all the know-how is there,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.800]   all the desire is there, and it feels really satisfying as you fall. But you don't know that
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.840]   you're in bondage to imminent destruction. You are. So in order to be fully free, it's not enough to
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.560]   have opportunity, ability, desire. The acts you desire and perform have to be pleasing to God,
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:14.320]   and they lead to unending joy, not any regret, because they're good, they're wise, they're holy,
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:24.240]   they're loving. We can experience that in measure or in part here, doing God's will in such a way
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.000]   that we will have no regret, but not perfectly. But in heaven, we will do everything we want to do
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.400]   because we will be made holy, and everything we want to do will not result in a crash landing,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.120]   but in greater and greater joy. Marvelous take. Thank you, Pastor John. And once again,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.200]   we are going to break for the weekend. And on Monday, we have a question from a man in Kalamazoo,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.760]   Michigan. His name, his legitimate name is Jonathan Edwards. I kid you not, he works in a
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.480]   warehouse and he wants to know whether he should pass the time not only listening to this podcast,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.960]   of course he should, but if he should also be passing the time by listening to audiobooks by
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.160]   non-Christian writers. Why or why not is it valuable to listen to books by non-Christians?
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.400]   We'll get the answer on Monday along with a really interesting book recommendation from Pastor John,
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.320]   an audiobook. It took him six months to finish and he commends. Well,
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.960]   for more about this podcast and to send us a question of your own, go to our online home
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.840]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn. I am your host, Tony Ranke. We'll see you next week to talk
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.640]   audiobooks.
