[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Joseph from Atlanta writes in to ask,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.120]   "Pastor John, if you were stranded on an island
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.720]   "and had to choose only three books to take,
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.880]   "which ones would you choose?"
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.580]   - I never know how to answer a question like this,
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.160]   but everybody knows the first one.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.540]   I would take the Bible.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.920]   I cannot live without the word of God,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.560]   and though I have enough of it stored up in my mind,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.520]   maybe to survive, I don't want to just survive.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.180]   So I would take a Bible, and then I would cheat
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.260]   and ask, can I take the collected works
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.040]   of Jonathan Edwards?
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.140]   - Well, that depends now if it's the Banner of Truth
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.400]   or the Yale edition.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.520]   - I would take the Yale.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.240]   - Okay, yeah, that's totally cheating.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.680]   - Yeah, okay, it's cheating.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.560]   Then if I had to pick an Edwards,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.340]   I would take the Religious Affections.
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.240]   And I would take them because they had a huge impact
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.520]   on me years ago, and because they are such
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   a deeply convicting analysis of the human soul
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.400]   and how to describe the godly soul,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.540]   and I know I would want to be godly on this island.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.120]   And I'm gonna surprise everybody with the last one.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.560]   If I had to throw them in a suitcase right now,
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.760]   and tomorrow it may be different,
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.720]   I would throw in Richard Baxter's A Christian Directory
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.620]   because it's 900 double-column pages
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.720]   of biblical analysis of the Christian life
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.260]   and all of its challenges of every possible kind.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.260]   It's a, Tim Keller has on the front of the book
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.180]   this statement, "The greatest manual
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.300]   "on biblical counseling ever produced."
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.820]   Okay, that should be enough for everybody.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.380]   And Jay Eipacker wrote the foreword
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.820]   for this reissue of the book
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.860]   and calls it stunning things as well.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.900]   So a book that just canvases the whole
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.100]   of the Christian life in its political and personal
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.860]   and inner and vertical relations
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.120]   with lots and lots of scripture
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.100]   would probably be very, very protective
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.960]   and stimulating for me on that island.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.980]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.940]   Richard Baxter's A Christian Directory
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.660]   can be tricky to buy online
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.820]   because I think it's out of print.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.340]   Of course, you can read it online for free
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.540]   by searching for it in Google Books,
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.900]   or you can search for printed copies for sale
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.460]   by Googling the book's ISBN number.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.680]   That number is 1-877-611131.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.140]   That's 1-877-611131.
