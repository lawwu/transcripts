[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.280]   Okay, we're gonna do a Q&A panel here,
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.300]   and we have saved 37 minutes.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.240]   We gained seven minutes in there somewhere.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.340]   We're gonna use the whole thing.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.260]   We're gonna go all the way to four o'clock.
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.760]   Let's have our four other faculty members come up here.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.860]   Let's put two chairs on each side of me.
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.800]   - Yeah, but this question's gonna allow you
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.720]   to stay in the course.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.800]   I'm approaching retirement, 50/50 allocation.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.600]   Don't do individual bonds.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.240]   So most of my bond allocation would be in the Vanguard
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.040]   Total Bond and International Bond Market funds.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.400]   Saw a CFP off the Garrett Network this summer
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.360]   who recommend taking all that bond money,
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.280]   liquidating it, and making a five-year CD ladder,
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.720]   as well as put the rest in a short-term bond market fund.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.360]   So I didn't do that.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.640]   I've ridden my bonds down.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.720]   Am I doing the right thing staying in the course,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.020]   especially in light of what Burton Malkiel said
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.600]   about us being in a time of financial repression
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.720]   where bonds going forward may not be
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.920]   what they've been in the past?
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.920]   - That sounds like a Rick question.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.560]   - Okay, thank you for that.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.520]   Good question.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.360]   And I understand the change in what's going on in your life
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960]   because you are going through the most stressful
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080]   financial part of your life right now,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.040]   which, aside from paying off college loans, is retirement,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.840]   the year before retirement to the year after retirement.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.180]   I don't know what's going to happen
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.100]   to the bond market going forward.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.600]   I believe that where we are right now
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.580]   is good for retirees in the long term.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.860]   Interest rates have gone back up.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.740]   Now we can get, finally, 4%.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.660]   So is now a good time to make that move
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.380]   of selling out of the thing that you watched go way up
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.620]   over the last couple of years
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.100]   because interest rates dropped below 1%
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.920]   and now have gone back to more normal levels.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.460]   I would not do that.
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.100]   I understand the idea of a CD ladder.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.940]   I just don't think that I would do something like that.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.020]   I mean, I would just take the dividends and interest
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.240]   from the portfolio and sell off the asset class
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.300]   that gets me back to my 50/50 every year
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.740]   and I'd just stay the course.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.380]   That would be my answer.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.200]   - Darwin.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.740]   - In my book, there was a chapter called Better Than Bonds
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.580]   that didn't work all that well for a long period of time
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.960]   and it was CDs that had easy early withdrawal penalties.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.540]   Now I still earned more than total bond,
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.240]   but I never exercised that put,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.540]   the right to sell it back to the bank at a very low penalty.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.980]   And guess what happened this year?
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.140]   It worked like magic.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.420]   Now banks and credit unions typically lag market rates.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.660]   So during the 40-year bull market when rates were falling,
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.660]   the banks and credit unions had great rates.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.060]   Now it's the other way around.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.100]   They're lagging.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.740]   So I would argue treasury bills,
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.300]   treasury bonds are playing incredible rates.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.620]   And I just did a back of the envelope calculation
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.260]   that I shared with Christine and Mike
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.340]   that you could build something close to a tips ladder
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.180]   that would give a guarantee,
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.620]   virtually guarantee 4.23% real
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.380]   after inflation withdrawal rate over 30 years.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.680]   So indexing for stocks, incredibly important.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.800]   And I own a lot of the total bond index fund,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.140]   but fixed income, high credit quality,
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.820]   there are some better alternatives out there.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.220]   - Yeah.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.640]   Okay, I just want to talk about one thing
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.340]   and that's the difference between philosophy and strategy.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.600]   And those of you who have heard some of my lectures
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.780]   before have heard this.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.940]   We are all bogleheads.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.940]   We all have the philosophy of low fee,
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.060]   stay the course, be diversified,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.380]   all the things you've heard today.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.900]   And so we all believe that, we're all here.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.920]   If I was gonna ask you how many of you believe that,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.800]   everybody in this room would raise their hand.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.060]   If I then said, how many of you are implementing that
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.420]   in your portfolio, you'd all raise your hands.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.700]   If I said, how many of you in this room
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.660]   have the exact same portfolio as another person,
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.900]   no one would raise their hand
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.340]   because what works for you, works for you.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.940]   It could be a CD ladder.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.260]   It could be the total bond market.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.020]   It could be a couple of different bond funds.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.740]   So what we're gonna be discussing up here
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.860]   and make it very clear,
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.820]   this is not, you should do it this way.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.260]   You should have a CD ladder.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.460]   You shouldn't have a CD ladder.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.660]   You should have treasuries.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.260]   You shouldn't have treasuries.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.820]   It is, that is individual to you.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.700]   It is a strategy that you're using
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.800]   and it's all good because it works for you.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.460]   So whatever works for you is good.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.900]   It's all under the same philosophy.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.760]   So I wanted to just separate the philosophy discussions
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.340]   from the strategy discussions.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.540]   - All right, we're gonna spend all our time
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.380]   on this question.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.420]   - Just wanna make a quick comment
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.340]   to kind of generalize my thoughts
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.000]   on retirement decumulation, which I work on a lot.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.060]   I like the idea of using portfolio withdrawals.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.140]   So my cash flow needs from my portfolio
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.860]   is kind of the yardstick to determine
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.060]   how much I would drop into each asset class.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.140]   So in my kind of model bucket portfolios,
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.280]   and I know Alan doesn't love this bucket strategy,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.060]   but I hear from a lot of retirees
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.020]   who say that it really works for them
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.700]   and mentally works for them.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.360]   The idea is that you use your portfolio withdrawals
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.860]   as the measuring stick.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.780]   So I think about like two years worth of portfolio
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.380]   withdrawals in liquidity, like cash,
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.660]   not messing around, CDs, whatever, guaranteed.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.500]   And then another, say, five to eight years
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.660]   in fixed income, short term, intermediate term,
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.180]   and some tips, and then anything beyond that
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.260]   going into a globally diversified equity portfolio.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.540]   That's how I do it.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.280]   I'm not retired, but that's how I think
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.560]   about retirement decumulation.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.100]   - Mike, you wanna go after this one?
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.820]   You know, who owns a TSPG fund?
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.140]   Raise your hand.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.020]   Yeah, 16 years I've owned it,
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.220]   and finally this year is its day in the sun.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.060]   All right, next question.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.660]   - Yeah, my question really is buckets of money.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.500]   I'm retired, I have a cash fund that's getting depleted,
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.140]   right, and most of the market is down
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.660]   and most of the asset classes.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.660]   At what point do you start replenishing your cash fund
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.940]   and in what priority order?
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.000]   You know, so you can have the cash.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.500]   - Great question.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.540]   So the way I think about it is
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.180]   that you build kind of next line reserves.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.200]   So you have maybe a couple of years' worth
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.060]   of portfolio withdrawals and true cash investments,
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.380]   and then within that fixed income portion,
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.460]   which I was talking about accounting
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.300]   for roughly five to eight years' worth
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.580]   of portfolio withdrawals, you kind of stair-step
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.500]   that portion of the portfolio by risk level.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.060]   So next in line would be short-term bonds,
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.580]   which have had losses this year,
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.180]   but certainly not in line with intermediate-term bonds.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.700]   They've held up much better.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.340]   So if I needed additional funds,
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.140]   my cash reserves were depleted,
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.460]   that's where I would turn.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.260]   I don't think I would preemptively
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.620]   start rating short-term bonds.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.020]   I would wait and see what happens there.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.100]   I would only shift more funds into cash at this point
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.580]   if those liquid reserves were already gone or almost gone.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.900]   - Yeah, the whole point of having that cash
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.500]   is to be able to write out years like this.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.900]   You knew it was possible that stocks and bonds
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.220]   could both go down at the same time.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.260]   That's why you have cash in your portfolio,
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.060]   'cause that's what you're gonna take it out of this year
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.820]   and maybe next year, and hopefully by then,
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.740]   one of those asset classes has recovered somewhat.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.540]   All right, let's take our next question.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.860]   - Thanks for being here.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.540]   I had the opportunity to sell a condo last year at a profit.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.340]   I don't have any housing expenses
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.540]   probably for the next 30 years,
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.180]   'cause my spouse is a clergy person,
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.620]   so we live in a parsonage.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.500]   So I'm curious to know,
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.860]   we talked about lump kind of investment.
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.100]   What are some recommendations
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.780]   or things I should keep in mind to use that profit
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.580]   if I'm not looking to tap into it
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.460]   for a retirement home for 30 years?
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.940]   - You're not planning on using the money for 30 years?
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.140]   - Yeah.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.740]   - And it's money you got from selling your house recently?
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.580]   - Yeah.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.940]   - Mike, you wanna take that?
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.340]   - To me, this just feels like it's any other chunk
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.740]   of the retirement portfolio.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.340]   The money doesn't quite care where it came from, right?
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.140]   And so now all we know
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.940]   is we're gonna be spending it 30 years from now.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.940]   So base it on that and the other things
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.820]   that determine your personal risk tolerance.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.420]   That's what it feels like to me.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.700]   - And the single lump, what we were talking about earlier,
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.140]   that's like better than trying to put it in
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.700]   over several different months?
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.820]   - Ah, sounds like your question's more lump sum
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.140]   versus dollar cost average.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.980]   Is that right?
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.820]   All right.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.460]   - Thank you.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.500]   I have a comment about lump sum versus dollar cost average.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.340]   Okay.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.340]   Lump sum, you rip the Band-Aid off all at once.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.740]   It's painful.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.300]   And you know you're gonna be wrong.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.500]   Doesn't matter what day you pick,
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.780]   the next day the market's going down.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.620]   You know that.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.300]   Could spend your life trying to figure it out.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.020]   But lump sum hurts really bad one time.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.220]   Dollar cost averaging hurts really bad
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.780]   many, many, many times.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.180]   And here's the problem with it.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.300]   I find, okay, unless it's an automated thing
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.460]   as Christine was talking about,
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.260]   where it's automated, you don't think about it,
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.180]   it comes out of your paycheck.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.020]   That's great.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.100]   That's great dollar cost averaging.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.940]   But when you have to physically go in
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.300]   and make a trade every month or every quarter
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.260]   to do your dollar cost averaging,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.700]   a lot of times it never gets done.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.580]   'Cause you gotta rip the Band-Aid off every single time.
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.780]   And it hurts.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.580]   And it's hard to do dollar cost averaging
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.100]   when you have to do it yourself.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.420]   So another reason to do lump sum
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.460]   besides the data that Christine,
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.300]   just jump off into the cold water,
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.620]   take your shock, and then it's in there.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.220]   And you don't have to worry about it after that.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.340]   I try to get people to do that.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.580]   It's very hard to do it.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.420]   But I think that's really the best way to do it.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.260]   - Thank you.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.100]   - Lump sum, mathematically superior.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.180]   Dollar cost averaging, emotionally superior.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.220]   If you're going to dollar cost average,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.700]   you can only do this with mutual funds, not ETFs.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.580]   But do it on an automated basis.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.260]   You can have Vanguard invest $10,000
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.540]   in Vanguard Total Stock Index Fund, VTSAX, not VTI,
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.740]   for 18 months and then stop.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.060]   Because when people have to do it,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.940]   either life gets in the way,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.740]   or North Korea launches a nuke,
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.260]   or there's a tweet, we always come up with excuses.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.700]   - Yeah, lump sum investing
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.120]   is definitely my favorite way of doing it as well.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.580]   I've said dollar cost averaging is for wimps.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.840]   And there's a lot of truth to that.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.420]   But the truth is I lump sum invest every month.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.980]   I have a certain amount of money to invest.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.780]   Some months it's more, some months it's less.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.180]   'Cause I have variable income.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.060]   But you know what?
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.820]   Over the 20 or 30 years that I'm accumulating,
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.140]   it works out because sometimes you're buying high
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.140]   and sometimes you're buying low.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.100]   But I'm always lump sum investing
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.820]   'cause I invest the entire amount I have to invest
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.140]   at that particular time.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.020]   And that includes the times when I sell a house
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.580]   and get a lump sum of money.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.420]   Next question.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:44.500]   - Hi, I have a friend who's been in a long-term relationship
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.780]   with her financial advisor.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.380]   And he's been unfaithful to her.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.220]   He's been cheating on her with a woman,
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.020]   with another woman named Ms. Profit.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:01.080]   How can I convince, or how can my friend rather?
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.720]   (laughing)
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:12.140]   How can my friend break up with her unfaithful advisor?
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.620]   - Okay, all right.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.840]   How to fire a financial advisor.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.920]   Christine, you wanna start with that one?
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.840]   - You know, how to fire an advisor.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.280]   I think, you know, it is, I will say,
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.680]   I've worked with friends about different business models
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.880]   for financial advice.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.880]   It's very hard to get people away from that all-in-one,
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   mainly the invisible hand that comes into their account
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.680]   and takes a percentage of their assets every year.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.680]   It's just sort of this mental game
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.720]   that makes it very easy for people to put up with
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.760]   kind of a bad relationship.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.680]   And so I do think, you know, it's a learning process.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.160]   I've worked with friends.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.400]   In fact, I had a friend who I spent a lot of time
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.280]   talking to about how to find a financial advisor.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.800]   I said, I think you wanna go hourly, blah, blah, blah.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.400]   And he went with some other business model.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.440]   I think it was actually a commission-based broker.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.000]   And then a couple of years later,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.060]   we're having the same conversation.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.520]   He wasn't happy with the way things were working.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.800]   So I just feel like it's an educational process.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.740]   You can walk them through the numbers
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.580]   about how much that advisor is subtracting
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.480]   from their portfolio and not adding value,
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.400]   and talk about, well, if you do need advice,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.480]   maybe kind of a surgical business model
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.320]   where you're paying for hourly advice
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.300]   is the better way to go.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:52.280]   - Yeah, I have the worst client retention in the business
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.520]   in that I do a one-time plan with the goal of being fired.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.600]   But the client has to fire their advisor.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.480]   And if they're enjoying it, I'm a little worried about them
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.440]   because they're real people.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.200]   So, you know, what I tell clients,
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.320]   you don't try to convince your advisor
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.540]   that they're doing the wrong thing.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.160]   Just say, I've decided to go a different direction.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.360]   Thank you for all the help you've given me,
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.520]   and leave it at that.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.440]   - Yeah, that's exactly, 100% agree with Alan.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.960]   The key words are, you know,
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.200]   I appreciate everything you did for me.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.320]   I've decided to go a different direction.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.680]   Those key words.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.360]   And I've been an advisor for 35 years.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.900]   I've heard these words.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.080]   But that's when I was a broker, not anymore.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.320]   - Okay, but yeah, but here's, are you asking about,
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   you're trying to convince your friend to fire their advisor?
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.920]   Is that what this question is?
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.280]   - Yeah, basically.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.400]   - Okay, but they're not ready yet to do it, correct?
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.840]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.680]   - Yes.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.080]   - Okay, so here's the problem.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.520]   They haven't heard it enough times.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.880]   This needs to be repeated.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.240]   This message needs to be repeated over,
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.600]   and over, and over again.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.720]   At least 100 times
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.520]   before they understand what you're saying.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.120]   And if they're not ready to fire their advisor yet,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.100]   then they haven't heard it 100 times yet.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.480]   Now, they're not gonna hear it 100 times from you,
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.280]   but different places out there.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.080]   In the media, they hear about it.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.840]   They hear, they read something about it.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.900]   They see it somewhere else.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.460]   Somebody else tells them.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.960]   You don't become a bogal head,
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.740]   well, most people don't become a bogal head overnight.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.680]   The light bulb goes on.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.600]   Well, you would be amazed how many times
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.680]   it's been sitting in front of you,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.320]   and for how long it's been sitting in front of you
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.600]   before you realize,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.340]   where have I been?
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.820]   Okay, but it took about 100 different impressions on you
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.160]   from various places before you finally did it.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.400]   And that's what's going on with your friend,
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.000]   is that it's not that you're doing anything wrong
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.920]   'cause you're not.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.960]   They just haven't been exposed long enough
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.040]   by enough people.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.360]   And eventually, at some point, they're gonna take notice.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.040]   They're actually gonna look at it and say,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.520]   what are you actually talking about?
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.480]   And look at it.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.800]   But she or he is just not there yet.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.020]   - I think I've helped literally thousands of doctors
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.780]   fire their financial advisors.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.420]   The course I put together is called
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.760]   How to Fire Your Financial Advisor.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.000]   But the point I make to them, though,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.920]   is it's way easier to fire them
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.320]   once you have a plan of what's gonna happen
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.040]   after you fire them.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.720]   So whether you are moving to a better advisor
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.280]   that gives better advice at a better price,
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.440]   or whether you are moving to a do-it-yourself model,
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.320]   there's no rush to fire that advisor.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.800]   You're gonna pay a little bit more in fees
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.960]   over the next two or three months
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.760]   while you educate yourself and put a plan together.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.480]   But get that all in place so you know what you're moving to.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.360]   And then it's really easy.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.600]   It's just a formality of, oh yeah, I gotta let 'em know
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.300]   I'm not gonna use 'em anymore.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.040]   I've already got the plan and what I'm going to do
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.340]   is I move from one place to another.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.960]   So I think that's the key, is know where you're going.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.680]   The actual conversation's pretty short
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.720]   as they've eliminated-- - Like, oh,
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   it's not you, it's me, Piper.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.600]   - Exactly, exactly. (audience laughing)
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.440]   - Thank you, thank you.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.720]   - You seem to have some experience
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.160]   with conversations in this regard.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.160]   - Thank you. - All right, next question.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:26.360]   - This question is for Mike Piper.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.400]   And he hasn't been getting questions or speaking much.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.600]   So, and this is always what I intended
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.440]   from the time I got in line,
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.520]   was to ask Mike Piper a question.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.800]   And I've read at least one of your books
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.920]   about social security.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   And seems like the claiming strategy, still for me,
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.540]   maybe I just didn't get it, is a little complicated.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.440]   I've used your calculator as well,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.440]   depending on if you're single versus if you have a spouse
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.880]   and then what the other thing is,
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.680]   is for the lower-income person,
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.520]   what age should they claim at.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.320]   I realize that there's a lot to it,
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.720]   that's why you wrote a book.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.440]   But if you could kind of give an overview of this,
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.880]   I'd appreciate it.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.840]   - Sure, that's one of the primary topics
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.080]   of my talk tomorrow.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.120]   So, we've got 15 minutes on just that, so.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.920]   - Do you have another question for him?
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.520]   - No, I'll be back.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.400]   - I think Mike's trying to get out of answering questions,
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   that's what I think.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.080]   - Hello, my question is for Christine.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.400]   You had mentioned, in retirement,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.760]   Ms. Ben said to add some cash to the three-fund portfolio.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.920]   Ms. Ben said that in retirement,
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.920]   add some cash to the three-fund portfolio.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.840]   How much cash, two to three years
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.360]   of discretionary income, question mark.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.160]   And just one thing for Mike.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.320]   Mike, I never have to answer or consider
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.080]   that question that he asked again.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.040]   I waited until 70, it's done.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.840]   - Thanks for that question.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.360]   So, I like the idea of using your,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   well, as a starting point, looking at all in spending,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.600]   including portfolio income, social security,
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.880]   income from every source.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.160]   Look at how much you need.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.080]   Subtract out non-portfolio income sources
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.480]   like social security, pension if you're lucky enough
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.840]   to have one, real estate income, that kind of stuff.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.360]   The amount that's left over with is the portfolio withdrawal
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.760]   and then I use that as kind of the measuring stick
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.280]   to determine how much to hold in cash.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.640]   So I think one to two years worth of portfolio withdrawals
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.400]   in cash is a good starting point.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.000]   I think most retirees probably would rather
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.160]   they had two years this year,
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.960]   given how bad the bond market has been.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.880]   But I would use that as kind of the measuring stick
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.120]   that I in turn would use to determine
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.880]   how much to invest in the other asset classes.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.360]   - I forgot to tell you, the reason I asked the question
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.360]   is I'm planning today to retire next June 30th.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.680]   Hopefully, between now and then,
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.040]   but I'm willing to wait another year if I have to
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.880]   because of the market coming back.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.200]   But I've never really been able to figure out
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.280]   exactly how much cash do you wanna have.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.120]   So thank you.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.960]   - Sure, thank you.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.800]   Thanks for coming.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:35.080]   - Hi, my question is for everyone basically
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.400]   or whoever's familiar with this topic.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.000]   I was wondering if you've done any studies
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.480]   on the bond 10 glide path approach
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.080]   versus the traditional glide path.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.960]   Maybe for simplicity, I think this is a newer thing
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.400]   that I discovered recently.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.960]   Instead of using your agent bonds,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.800]   the bond 10 glide path suggests that
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.160]   you should hit your maximum bond around retirement.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.200]   And then you should, quote unquote, die with 100% stocks.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.640]   I find it very counterintuitive,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.360]   but I like the idea because it claims to minimize
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.480]   the, I think, sequence of return risk.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.040]   Basically, it's like regardless of when you retire,
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.720]   you're gonna be more okay using this approach
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.880]   versus the traditional approach.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.600]   And I was wondering if you have any analysis
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.880]   or pros and cons of these two approaches.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.240]   - Okay, you know I'm gonna talk about bond 10s.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.280]   Mike?
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.120]   Oh, Alan.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.480]   For those who don't know what a bond 10 is,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.200]   the idea is that you go down in stocks
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.720]   until you get really close to retirement,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.640]   maybe five years before.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.680]   And that's when you're at your most conservative
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.840]   asset allocation.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.980]   And then for about five years after your retirement date,
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.000]   you're still in that conservative allocation.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.800]   And then you actually start increasing
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.720]   your stock-to-bond percentage,
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.720]   the idea being to reduce your sequence of returns risk.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.280]   Good idea, bad idea, Mike?
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.400]   - I think it's entirely reasonable.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.600]   Frankly, you're gonna have a hard time
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.760]   getting a strong opinion from me
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.440]   about any asset allocation topic.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.040]   Sorry, to share one analogy that I use a lot of the time.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.960]   My mom is a dietician.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.880]   My wife's mom is also a dietician.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.000]   And if you ask them what makes a healthy meal
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.400]   or what is a healthy meal,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.720]   they don't tell you grilled zucchini and something.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.640]   What they tell you is it needs to have
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.880]   a reasonable number of calories,
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.160]   it should probably include a vegetable,
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.280]   limited amount of sugar.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.360]   They give you characteristics.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.680]   And there's a zillion meals
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.800]   that meet those characteristics.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.440]   And it's the same thing with the portfolio.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.960]   There's characteristics.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.160]   It needs to be diversified, it should have low cost,
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.200]   it should have an allocation
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.520]   that's roughly in keeping with your risk tolerance.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.640]   And then there's a million and one ways
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.160]   you can design a portfolio
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.240]   that meets all of those requirements.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.920]   So, on the topic specifically of a bond tent,
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.760]   yeah, I think that's one reasonable way to do it.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.000]   I think it's also fine to just keep a static allocation.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.280]   If you're interested in studies, though,
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.480]   so it came from Wade Fowle and Michael Kitsis,
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.200]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.520]   As far as follow-up research
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.680]   that's been done in the years since,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.280]   I'm not super sure if they're,
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.480]   oh, Christine, great.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.000]   - That was a good punt.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.000]   So, my former colleague, David Blanchett,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.560]   did some research on this
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.600]   and concluded that he liked a more traditional glide path.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.240]   He found that actually it made very little difference
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.520]   over most market time periods of retirement.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   And just behaviorally, he felt that it was more attractive
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.840]   to use a traditional trending glide path,
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.520]   which would either stay static
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.720]   or get a little bit more conservative
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.640]   as the person gets further on into retirement.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.760]   Because the net effect of this idea of starting retirement
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.480]   with a really conservative portfolio
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.240]   is that at some point after Armageddon occurs
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.920]   in the equity market,
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.680]   you're supposed to be adding to equity exposure.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.080]   Does that work behaviorally?
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.240]   I think that's a big question mark.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.080]   And I think that's kind of what David's research flagged.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.960]   - This is historic because it might be the first time
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.920]   that I've ever sort of disagreed with Mike Piper.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:17.440]   I can't get into the details of it,
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.440]   but there was a flaw in the assumption of that glide path
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.840]   or increasing stock study.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.520]   But even more important, as Christine just mentioned,
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.520]   from a behavioral aspect,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.800]   it is really, really hard to get people
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.880]   to rebalance in down markets,
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.800]   to get them to take more equity risk in down markets,
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.280]   very, very unlikely.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.800]   I disagree with that.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.120]   - And then there's this side.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.480]   I do agree with Mike.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.280]   We're talking about what's called a reverse glide path,
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.760]   which means that when you retire,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.960]   you're at the most conservative you're going to be.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.760]   And then over time, you actually increase your allocation
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.000]   because it's more of a liability matching.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.720]   Your future liabilities are better matched
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   to the long-term liability assets of the portfolio
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.120]   if there's an increasing asset.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.240]   But there's something else that goes on
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.280]   and depends on how much money you have.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.680]   Depends on whether Social Security
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.840]   is covering all of your expenses or not,
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.000]   or you've got a pension, or you've got other income,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.760]   or maybe you're gonna get an inheritance,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.800]   or maybe your kids didn't spend their 529
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.720]   and it's time for you to take
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.600]   that round-the-world jet tour, right?
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.920]   But the point is that it depends on each individual person
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.320]   which works for you.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.640]   I mean, clients I work with,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.600]   we do reverse glide paths all the time.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.640]   I just say, at some point, stop rebalancing.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.480]   Just let it go.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.200]   Especially if you're gonna put your bonds
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.040]   in your IRA account
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.640]   and you're gonna do these Roth conversions
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.400]   and then when the money goes over to the Roth,
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.760]   you want it to be an equity because it's tax-free.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.560]   In the meantime, you're not gonna be selling stocks
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.560]   in your taxable account
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.680]   because that would just generate taxes.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.840]   And then eventually, you're gonna make RMDs
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.800]   from your IRA or 401(k).
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.080]   So you're gonna have this natural increase
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.120]   in equities anyway.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.120]   And if you're okay with that
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.640]   because you're just living off the income
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.280]   from your Social Security
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.960]   and maybe dividends and interest income
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.720]   and maybe eventually the RMD, why not?
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.960]   It's better for the kids.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.280]   - I always think these questions are kind of funny
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.000]   because they apply to such a small percentage of people.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.680]   Most of us either have well more than we need
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.240]   and we don't really have to play around
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.240]   with all this safe withdrawal rate stuff.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.360]   We spend what we wanna spend
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.880]   and we'll leave the rest to our heirs or charity or whatever.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.840]   And then there's lots of people
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   that don't have anywhere near what they need
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.240]   and are trying to maximize it
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.080]   and buying SPIAs and trying to delay Social Security
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.760]   if they can and living on Social Security eventually.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.640]   Only actually a very small percentage of people
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.440]   have just barely enough when they retire.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.200]   And those are the ones who got to pay a lot of attention
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   to these sorts of studies.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.480]   If you just work another year or two,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.000]   you might not have to pay any attention to them at all.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.240]   - Sorry, that's why rules of thumb don't work.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.960]   You know, your age in bonds minus 10, all this.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.800]   It doesn't work.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.680]   If it only applies to a very small number of people, okay?
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.520]   What works for you?
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.840]   What strategy works for you is what works for you.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.400]   Okay, it's all the same philosophy.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.920]   Do it low cost, do it, you know, stay the course
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   and everything we talked about today.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.160]   But the strategy that you're gonna implement,
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.120]   whether it's a bond tent,
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   whether it's a decreasing allocation to equity,
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.800]   whether it's an increasing allocation to equity,
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.480]   whatever is going to be unique to you.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.040]   And you have to figure out what that is.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.960]   And hopefully that's what this whole conference is about,
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.760]   helping you figure out what that is.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.520]   - All right, let's take our next question.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.520]   - Hi, good afternoon.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.800]   Edward Chow from Westport, Connecticut.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.960]   As I've learned about more about index investing,
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.080]   the new money has gone into broadly diversified
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.360]   low cost index funds.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.080]   I still have a chunk of my retirement accounts
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.600]   in kind of systematic value type of products,
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.880]   which for which I've held
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.080]   and enjoyed 10 years of underperformance.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.200]   Stay the course or time to quit cold turkey?
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.840]   - Can you tell us what your investing plan
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.200]   says you're supposed to do?
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.920]   - It's I think what we've heard today,
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.000]   broadly diversified low cost.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.880]   - Okay, anyone wanna take a stab at that one?
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.080]   - Absolutely stay the course.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   I mean, if you've made a value tilt 10 years ago,
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.880]   now's not the time to change that.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.640]   I mean, you gotta stay the course.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.160]   - Anybody have a different opinion?
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.440]   Should you bail on a value tilt
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.560]   if you've had it for many years
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.840]   and suffered through it like those of us who have one?
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.200]   You're not alone, I can tell you that.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.040]   Next question.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.440]   - That's because Larry Swedville was here 10 years ago.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.320]   - Mark Day in Boulder, Colorado.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.000]   - Right.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.080]   So a shameless plug for The Economist magazine
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.760]   is just reading the recent issue.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.560]   And it said that the Fed may never return to 2%
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.080]   as far as a target rate, maybe it'll be 4%.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.040]   In light of that, what do you guys think about the bond,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.760]   maybe the stock, but I'm most interested in the fixed asset,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.920]   treasury tips, that part.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.080]   - You're talking about a 2% target for inflation?
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.120]   - Correct.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.080]   That after whatever's gonna happen.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.280]   - So is your question,
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.760]   how do you think we should invest in bonds today?
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.600]   Is that your question?
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.240]   - Yes, that's correct.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.360]   Given something other than a 2%,
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.280]   probably a higher target rate.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.120]   - Okay.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.880]   - I think Jason Zweig is in here.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.160]   I think the last I looked,
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.760]   there was a study that showed that the top economists
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.160]   have called the direction up or down
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.880]   of the 10-year treasury bond correct
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.720]   about 35% of the time, less than a coin flips.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.520]   Which is tied to inflation.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.800]   And none of us knows what inflation,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.480]   including those economists.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.080]   In fact, if anything, I would probably bet the opposite.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.080]   And again, tips, you know, I wrote a piece on I-bonds
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.200]   several months ago, the best thing since sliced bread.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.240]   I-bonds are giving a zero real return,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.160]   tips are giving a 1.7 real return.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.520]   - You know, I've been talking about inflation
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.240]   for years and years and years and years,
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.720]   and nobody ever wants to listen to me.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.240]   And finally it shows up this year.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.720]   And so it's kind of exciting that way.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.520]   But you know, in a lot of ways you've tilted your,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.240]   you should have considered inflation all along.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.400]   It is the great enemy of your portfolio.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.680]   I think I saw Bill Bernstein sneak in back there,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.120]   but he's talked about deep risks, right?
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.720]   Inflation and deflation and confiscation and devastation.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.840]   But if you look at how likely each of those are,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.280]   inflation is far more likely than any of the other
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.600]   deep risks that your portfolio faces.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.080]   And so your whole portfolio ought to be geared
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.720]   to deal with this risk.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.840]   And so actually half of my bonds
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.400]   are in inflation index bonds,
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.040]   whether they're in tips or whether they're in I-bonds.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.520]   And you know, I feel like that's actually
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.000]   not paying off great this year.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.040]   We're going to talk about that more later in the conference,
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.320]   but you know, I think you got to think about inflation
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.840]   anytime you're designing a portfolio,
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.080]   'cause I think it's maybe the number one consideration.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.000]   - But specifically if the target rate went up,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.800]   let's just say it never returned to 2%,
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.560]   would that change our strategy?
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.200]   Would that change the suggested strategy?
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.800]   - So the economist article that you read speculated
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.560]   that the Fed is now gonna change their target rate.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.320]   - That they'll never get back to 2%.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.400]   - That's the difference between changing their target rate.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.120]   I mean, if the target rate is 2%, that's the target.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   - That they'll change it and it'll never go up.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.560]   - Well, in the short term, it won't come back to 2%.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.400]   - I don't know.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.440]   They're having a Volcker moment right now,
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:30.600]   and they're pretty determined
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.840]   to at least get the inflation going the other way
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.400]   in a rapid way.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.160]   And I know that the timing of it
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:43.080]   on a presidential cycle thing is right.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.000]   In other words, it's right when they should be doing this.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.480]   I don't know the answer whether or not it's gonna go.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.120]   I don't know what The Economist magazine said,
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.120]   but I have some eye bonds in my portfolio as well.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.720]   I mean, I like them even at a 0% return, but.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.440]   - Alan has mentioned this a couple of times,
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.720]   kind of just snuck it in.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.000]   But TIPS right now, 1.7%.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.040]   That's higher than we've seen in a long time,
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.000]   like considerably higher.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.120]   So, I mean, I don't necessarily have anything brilliant
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   to say about exactly where inflation is going
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.400]   or any predictions you can make
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.920]   that are useful in that regard.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.720]   But as far as bond investing,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.080]   there's better opportunities available right now
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.000]   than there have been in a long time.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.480]   - And I don't know if their target did change
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.280]   if I would invest any differently than I invest now, right?
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.400]   I mean, I would expect the markets
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.880]   to adjust to that information.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.360]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.480]   - Next question?
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.520]   I think probably our last question.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:54.320]   - My question is around what I perceive
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.760]   as perhaps conflicting advice,
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.520]   even in the boggleheads community.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.440]   And I'll give you two instances
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.280]   that sometimes confound me personally.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   So there's, I don't know if this person
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.160]   is a bogglehead or not,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.040]   but he's written a book where he says,
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.040]   "Don't worry about international stocks.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.040]   "If you invest in VTSAX, Vanguard Total Stock Market,
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.240]   "you also get international,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.680]   "so don't need to worry about that.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.040]   "Simplify even further."
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.120]   So that's one instance.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.480]   And today we heard the three portfolio strategy.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.840]   The other one is where I've heard that,
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.440]   "Oh, you should tilt towards small cap
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.240]   "because there is statistical evidence
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.640]   "that shows over the long run, 20, 30 years,
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.680]   "there is a small gain compared to a three-fund portfolio."
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.760]   I don't know how much it is, 0.5%,
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.800]   which does equate to maybe a million or two extra
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.000]   in your retirement portfolio.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.560]   So there's all these nuances
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.240]   and sometimes it gets confusing.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.360]   So if you would elaborate.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.840]   - Okay, let's do lightning round.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.200]   We'll go across the stage from this side to this side.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.720]   Your thoughts on international
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   and your thoughts on a small value tilt.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.560]   - Sure.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.080]   So international is one area
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.120]   where I did disagree with Jack Bogle.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.000]   He thought that the US market,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.960]   because most of the US large caps, or many,
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.600]   are very globally diversified,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.560]   that it was fine to hold just US market.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.600]   I like the idea of young investors
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.920]   using the global market cap as a starting point.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.880]   I don't understand why you would say no
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.520]   to that free diversification.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.880]   And yes, it absolutely has not delivered for investors.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.880]   We've seen a long stretch of underperformance
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.160]   of non-US stocks.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.520]   But there have been periods in my recent memory
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.240]   where international stocks have outperformed.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   And I believe that will be the case again.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.480]   So younger investors go with a global market cap.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.320]   Older adults who are beginning
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.800]   to spend from their portfolios,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   I would be a little bit more conservative,
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.560]   maybe holding 20, 25% of equity exposure in non-US.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.000]   I don't feel strongly about the international tilt.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.840]   There's certainly some data that shows
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.680]   the outperformance of small cap stocks.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.720]   But I don't feel strongly that investors
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.880]   embed that into their portfolios on an ongoing basis.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.560]   - I'm from Colorado.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.200]   I wouldn't only buy companies based in Colorado.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.080]   Same sort of diversification strategy.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.360]   If you had enough international
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.960]   with the total stock index fund,
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.640]   you wouldn't see such huge differences in performance.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.120]   With that said, Jack Bogle has been right,
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.720]   even since his passing.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.760]   Regarding small cap, I beg to differ.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.880]   The evidence showed that for a long period of time,
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.720]   small cap had outperformed large cap.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.120]   We don't know what's gonna happen going forward.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.560]   - I have both a small cap
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.600]   and an international tilt in my portfolio.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.200]   I'm 2/3 US, 1/3 international,
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.680]   and a pretty good small value tilt.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.080]   That has been wrong for my entire investing career.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.640]   (audience laughs)
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.720]   I'm expecting it to pay off at some point.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.760]   I think international is a screaming deal right now.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.240]   And part of that story is a small value story.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.160]   International companies are smaller
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.800]   and more value-y than US companies.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.600]   And so when I think, when the pendulum swings,
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.680]   I think both of those are gonna do a whole lot better
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.600]   than they have in the recent past.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.000]   - So the international market has made up
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.560]   of very different industry groups than the US stock market,
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.280]   which is dominated in the US market
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.400]   by technology and healthcare.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.760]   Internationally, you've got a lot of material stocks,
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   industrial stocks, oil, so forth, commodity-type things.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.200]   In a falling interest rate environment,
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.840]   those stocks do not outperform the growth stocks.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.280]   The growth stocks take advantage of that,
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.480]   which is what happened in the US market for many years,
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.160]   and the US market has outperformed.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.640]   But that is over, okay, or at least I think it's over.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.160]   We're now gonna get back to something more neutral.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.840]   So if that's the case, this year,
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.440]   international stocks have outperformed
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.400]   the US market by 10%.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.120]   Problem is, the dollar has increased by 10%.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.480]   So net-net, they were about equal.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.040]   But it is actually happening.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.560]   These industry groups that are international
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.080]   are outperforming.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.040]   All right, so where do I fall on this?
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.560]   I don't know what the future's gonna be.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   So I'm, like Jim, about 2/3 US, 1/3 international.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.520]   And if I was 40% international and 60% US,
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.560]   which is the global equity market, VT,
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.200]   the Vanguard World Equity Fund,
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.640]   I'd be fine with that too.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.000]   As far as small cap, I'm not a big believer in small cap,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   but I am a believer in if you're going to do
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.400]   factor investing, which is small cap,
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.000]   you might as well just put all these factors together
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.920]   and do a multi-factor small cap value fund
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.080]   and a very, very intensive one.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.960]   And Vanguard doesn't have a very intensive
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.320]   small cap value fund, but you would use an Advantis
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.640]   or a DFAETF or something like that,
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.520]   so you get the really intensive small cap value.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.680]   So I do have some of that in my portfolio.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.160]   - On the topic of small cap value tilting,
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.560]   I would enthusiastically decline to have an opinion.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.240]   On the topic of international holdings,
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.240]   I think one thing that often gets left out
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   is that in just the original idea of diversification,
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.560]   not the asset class correlations stuff,
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.320]   but the don't have all your eggs in one basket,
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.480]   by including an international fund,
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.560]   you get to keep the same stock exposure
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.000]   and reduce the exposure to any one individual company.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.880]   I think that by itself has some degree of value.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.660]   Might international also provide
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.160]   some sort of rebalancing benefit, maybe.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.600]   But for me, honestly, a significant part of the reason
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.360]   is simply it reduces my exposure
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.120]   to the individual risks related
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.620]   to any one individual company.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.280]   - All right, our time is now gone.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.600]   Two housekeeping items I want you to be aware of.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.680]   One at 5.30 in this room is the reception.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.080]   So you come back here at 5.30 for the reception.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.760]   Do not come back here tomorrow morning.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.640]   This is not where the main conference is going to be.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.200]   That's gonna be one floor higher,
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.980]   and that way, I don't remember what the room's called,
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.180]   but it's not here, so keep that in mind.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.260]   Let's give a big round of applause to our panel.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.260]   (audience applauds)
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.260]   Thank you.
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:26.580]   And we're looking forward to a great three days
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.420]   with all of you.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.140]   We'll be around to answer questions and chat with you.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.780]   I think we'll all stay in the whole conference,
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.620]   and I look forward to meeting each of you.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.620]   (audience mumbling)
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.180]   What?
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.020]   What'd you say?
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.840]   You guys want breakfast?
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.180]   Can we give them breakfast?
