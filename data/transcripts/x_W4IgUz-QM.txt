[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:18.720]   the Gospel according to St. Luke, in the fourth chapter, verses 18 and 19.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.000]   In the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, the Spirit of the Lord is upon
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.800]   me because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.360]   He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.160]   recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.760]   acceptable year of the Lord.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:04.200]   Now this is the statement, you remember, which our Lord read out of the book of the prophet
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:12.840]   Isaiah when on that occasion he attended the service in the synagogue of his hometown of
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840]   Nazareth.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.000]   And you remember how, according to the custom of those days, after he had closed the book
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.560]   and given it back to the minister, he sat down.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:40.320]   And then he began to say unto them, This day, this scripture, is fulfilled in your ears.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.240]   Now I am calling your attention to this statement, therefore, for this reason.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.960]   The whole message of the Bible is just a message to tell us that the trouble of the world is
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.760]   essentially due to one thing only, and that is to the tragic refusal of mankind to listen
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   to God.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.800]   That is the only message in the Bible, really.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.560]   It is a practical book.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.400]   It is a book that comes to us exactly where we are.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.360]   It does not postulate anything at all except that we are failures and sinners and that
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.040]   we are in need.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.760]   And it comes to us and speaks to us directly.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.240]   It speaks to us individually.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.800]   It speaks about the state of the whole world.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.880]   And its message is to tell us that the world is as it is tonight, and we all are as we
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:52.200]   are because of our refusal to listen to the voice and to the word of God.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.240]   In that sense, therefore, the Bible has a very simple message.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.040]   It says that there is only one thing wrong, and that is the one thing.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.240]   Now the world, of course, is very different at that point.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.320]   The world is aware that there is something wrong, but it has many, many explanations,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.720]   and they differ from man to man and from class to class and from group to group.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.080]   You read your newspapers and you see exactly what I mean.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.480]   You see one section saying that all the troubles are due to one section only, but then you
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.600]   take up the opposite paper, the paper that represents the other view, and you find that
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.760]   it says equally confidently that the troubles are due entirely to the people on that first
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.600]   side, and so on.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   And so men differ in their explanations.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.160]   It's always this, that, or the other.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.240]   But no, says the Bible, it isn't.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.700]   There is only one cause of all our ills, and here it is.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.680]   It is man's wrong relationship to God.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.320]   It's out of that that everything else comes, all selfishness and greed, all cruelty and
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:15.560]   malice and bitterness, everything that spoils life tonight comes out of this one thing.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.440]   You can trace them all back to this common source.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.260]   So that therefore, you see, the Bible says that the answer to all our questions and the
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.080]   one solution to all our problems is to come back and to listen to God, to hearken unto
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080]   him.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.280]   Well, now then, the New Testament in particular tells us that God still speaks to us.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.880]   The Old Testament tells us the same thing.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.320]   Before Christmas, we spent a number of Sunday nights listening to what God had said in those
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.600]   days back in the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.720]   The astounding thing with which we are confronted is this, that in spite of men in his folly
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.740]   and his ignorance turning away from God, God has gone after him.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.760]   God has followed him.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.560]   God has sought him out and has spoken to him.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.320]   And of course, when you come to the New Testament, you find this in a still clearer manner.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   It is God still speaking, but speaking in a new way.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.240]   And last Sunday night, we were considering the first announcement of that, as it were.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.800]   We took that great word, that great vice, that word that came from heaven on the Mount
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   of Transfiguration.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.840]   There were Peter and James and John, three of the disciples of our Lord.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.920]   They had gone with him up onto a mountain.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.800]   And there he was praying, and as he was praying, they saw him transfigured.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   His face began to shine with a brightness above the brightness of the sun.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.760]   His very clothes were changed.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.020]   They began to shine.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.520]   He was transfigured.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.760]   And then there came and appeared unto them Moses and Elias, who began to speak to our
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.560]   Lord.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.300]   And it was a wonderful occasion.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.840]   But the significant thing was the voice that came from heaven saying, "This is my beloved
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.280]   son.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.160]   Hear him."
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:32.560]   God now calls upon men and women to listen to this person who was there transfigured
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.680]   on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.280]   That is the command, "Hear him.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.880]   Here's my answer," says God.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.200]   "This is what I've got to say.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Hear him.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   Listen to him.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.440]   It is through him I am now speaking."
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.760]   Well, very well then.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.280]   The important thing for us, therefore, is to discover what he has to say.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.600]   And it is in order that we may discover what he's got to say that I am calling your attention
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.320]   to this incident, which is recorded here in this fourth chapter of the Gospel according
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.000]   to St. Luke.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.760]   The whole occasion, of course, is an extremely interesting and important one.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:22.400]   Here is a person who was born in a little place called Bethlehem in a very remarkable
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:30.400]   and unusual manner, who was then taken and brought up in this little place called Nazareth.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.560]   And there he lived ostensibly as the son of Joseph and Mary.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.480]   Joseph, a carpenter and Mary.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.440]   And he seemed to be like every other child, mixed with them and probably played with them
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.880]   as usual, and yet there were strange things about him.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.400]   He astonished them now and again.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.080]   There's an incident at the age of twelve, you remember, when they'd gone up to Jerusalem
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.120]   and had taken him with them.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.720]   And they thought that he was with them on the return journey, but found he wasn't.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.880]   And they went back and found him in the temple, arguing with the doctors of the law and refuting
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.640]   them, and confounding them and confuting them in the discussion.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:13.560]   But then we are told nothing about him for another eighteen years.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:21.480]   Then suddenly at the age of thirty he begins to go out on a ministry.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.200]   And one of the first things he did, you remember, was to go to John the Baptist, who had been
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.860]   preaching in the wilderness, a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:37.000]   And our Lord went to him and asked him to baptize him, and John remonstrated and said,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.640]   "No, I shouldn't baptize you, you ought to be baptizing me."
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.880]   "No," said our Lord, "suffer it to be so, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.760]   And John baptized him in the Jordan.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:56.160]   And as he was there in the water, coming out of the waters of Jordan, the Holy Spirit descended
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.680]   upon him in the form of a dove.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:06.640]   And again that same voice came, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.220]   And then comes the incident that is recorded in this chapter, how he was led by the Spirit
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.420]   up into the wilderness, and there he was tempted forty days and forty nights of the devil.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.340]   We are given an account of three specific temptations.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:28.420]   But our Lord was able to repel the devil so easily, and then, after that we are told,
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:34.140]   he came back in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.620]   And there went a fame of him throughout all the region round about, and he taught in their
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.980]   synagogues being glorified of all.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:46.820]   And then he came to Nazareth, and this incident takes place.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.780]   Now this is important and significant for this reason.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:56.980]   Here, in a sense, is the real beginning of our Lord's public ministry.
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.620]   We are to hear him.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:05.820]   The voice of God calls upon us, indeed commands us, to hear him, to listen to him.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.860]   And therefore I say we want to know, what has he got to say?
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.260]   Well now then, here he is at the very outset of his ministry.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.980]   He walks into the synagogue.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.260]   He asks for the book to read.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.620]   They hand him the roll of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.460]   He finds this place, this particular chapter.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.060]   And there he reads out these words that we are looking at.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:32.540]   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.580]   the poor.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:41.100]   He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to grant recovery of sight to the blind, to
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:47.260]   set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable ear of the Lord.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.500]   And he shuts the book, hands it back to the minister, and sits down.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.740]   It was their custom then to speak seated.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.500]   He sat, and they all sat.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   And they looked at him.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.980]   We are told that all eyes were trained, as it were, upon him.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.460]   The eyes of all that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.780]   And he began to say, and what did he say?
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.980]   Well, here is his message.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:22.940]   So that here we have, you see, a very perfect synopsis of his message and his teaching.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.740]   This is the thing to listen to.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.820]   What has he got to say?
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.500]   Well we can divide it up very easily.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:37.060]   You notice that the first thing he says is that he draws attention to himself.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.220]   This is quite vital, and we can never omit to emphasize it.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:48.300]   He starts by calling attention, directing attention to himself.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:04.340]   Nazareth, remember, the place where he had been brought up, the place where everybody
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:11.740]   knew him, the place where everybody referred to him as Joseph's son.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:18.380]   It is there that he doesn't hesitate to say, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, upon
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.180]   me.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:28.020]   Not content with that, he emphasizes the fact that he has been anointed, anointed of the
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.980]   Lord, to preach the gospel to the poor.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.420]   He's been sent.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.260]   And then he makes it quite explicitly, you remember, in the words that I've already
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:49.860]   quoted to you, when he says, this day is this scripture fulfilled in your years.
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:56.460]   The scripture is that prophecy of Isaiah concerning a great Messiah that was going to come, a
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.900]   Messiah that would deliver the people.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.640]   You remember the succession of prophets?
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.540]   We considered their message before Christmas.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.140]   The world was in trouble then as it is now.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.860]   The children of Israel were in trouble.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.180]   And they said, what can we do?
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.740]   What hope is there for us?
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:18.420]   Back came the answer from God through the prophets, a Messiah is going to come, a deliverer
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:24.460]   is going to be sent, God is going to visit and to redeem his people.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:35.000]   And here is this person who would be known so well in Nazareth for all those years.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.520]   He solemnly avers, this day is this scripture fulfilled in your years.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.720]   He's making a tremendous claim for himself.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:54.560]   And the claim is, I say, that he is the Messiah.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.720]   I don't stay with that this evening, because in a sense we dealt with that last Sunday
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   night.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.280]   This is my beloved son.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   God attests him.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.080]   He here now claims it himself.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.120]   But it's important, I say, that we should listen to that and bear that in mind, because
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:25.400]   the whole value of his message, in a sense, lies in the fact that he is who he is.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:35.480]   He sits before them there and he makes this claim, that he is God's deliverer.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:42.960]   He is the one anointed, sent by God, equipped for his task, filled with power by the Holy
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:51.800]   Spirit, to be the Messiah, the deliverer, the Savior long promised, that the world so
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   needs.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.960]   Very well then, if he is the Savior, what has he got to say?
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   What is his message?
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   What is his teaching?
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.920]   "Hear him," says the voice.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.600]   Very well, like the people in Nazareth, we listen, we wait upon him.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.680]   What has he got to say to us?
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.400]   Here is the answer.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:21.880]   It's all in those words that he's just been reading from Isaiah's prophecy.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.120]   That's his message.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.560]   And the first thing we've got to say about the message is this, that it's a message that
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.160]   always comes to men and women as a surprise.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.880]   Christianity always seems surprising at first, doesn't it?
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.720]   We've all got our ideas about it.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.960]   The Jews had got their ideas.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.800]   Their idea of the Messiah when he came was that he'd be a mighty personage, that he'd
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   set himself up as a king, he'd gather a great army together, he'd advance against the Roman
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.320]   conquerors and rout them, and set up his kingdom, and then proceed to conquer probably most
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.920]   of the countries of the earth, and he would therefore raise up Jerusalem and the Jews
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.880]   to be the supreme nation of the entire world.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.440]   That was their expectation.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.360]   That was what they thought he was going to say.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.160]   He says, "I am the Messiah."
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.200]   Very well, what is the Messiah going to do?
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.440]   And those were their ideas.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.600]   But you notice that what he says is something very different.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:35.440]   He says that he has been sent to preach the gospel to the poor, to bind up the broken
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:43.720]   hearted, to set captives at liberty, to give sight to the blind, to set at liberty those
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.880]   who have been bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.440]   They didn't understand this.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.360]   The whole story of the four gospels is that none of them understood that.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.920]   You remember that even John the Baptist of all people got a bit confused at last.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.920]   He'd been in prison for a long time, and he sent two messengers to Christ asking this
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:09.560]   question, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.320]   "I don't understand," says John.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:19.080]   "I believed at first that you were the Messiah, but what are you doing?
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.600]   You're spending your time up there in Galilee in the north amongst just a rabble of ordinary
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.240]   common people, and you're speaking to them and doing certain things.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.380]   Why don't you come down to Jerusalem?
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.560]   Why don't you set yourself up as king?
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.500]   Art thou he that should come?"
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.160]   Even John was tainted with it.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.600]   That's what is expected of him.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:45.720]   But his reply, I say, is something entirely different.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.200]   And this is the tragedy of the world still, that people cannot believe his message, because
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.760]   they've got these preconceived notions and ideas.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.640]   "Christianity," they say, "religion, what is it?"
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.440]   Obviously, it's going to be some great philosophy, or it's going to be some great ethical, moral
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   program.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440]   "Religion, what is it?"
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.360]   Well, it's an appeal, an exhortation.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.600]   It's something that tells us to live in a certain way, and that if we do so, we'll save
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.680]   ourselves.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.360]   But it's nothing of the sort.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.440]   It always comes as a surprise and as a shock.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.320]   Well what is this message?
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:29.080]   Well the first word he notices, that he uses, is the word "gospel."
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:35.560]   "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel."
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   And what a word that is.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.120]   That word means good news.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.440]   He says, "No, no, I haven't come to set up an earthly kingdom in the sense that you think."
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.920]   And as he said on another occasion to a man who'd been listening to his sermon, but only
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.760]   listening in a mechanical manner, not listening to the Spirit, because the man more or less
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.040]   interrupts him and says, "Master, speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.040]   with me."
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:08.360]   And our Lord turned to him and said, "Men, who has made me, or called me to be a divider
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.920]   of goods among men, I'm not sent to do that.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.280]   He's not some super economist.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.120]   He's not a political agitator.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.600]   He's not an earthly king.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   He's none of these things.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.280]   No, he has come to preach good news.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.720]   He's got a gospel."
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:38.880]   Well now we start with this because it leads me to ask a question.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:46.240]   According to this book, what we all need, I say, above everything else is to hear him.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.000]   And if we hear him truly, we shall rejoice.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.560]   So the first question we ask ourselves is this, "Has this message come to us as good
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.560]   news?"
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:04.520]   "Listen to me," says the speaker seated there, "the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   hath anointed me and sent me to preach the gospel, good news.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.600]   I'm the herald of a good news.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.680]   I am the bearer of glad tidings."
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.400]   Has this Christian message come to you like that, my friend?
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.120]   Do you regard the message of Christianity tonight as the greatest bit of good news you've
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.080]   ever heard in your life?
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.960]   Now I start with that question for this reason, that if your idea of Christianity doesn't
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:43.080]   start with that, according to our Lord, it isn't Christianity.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:49.480]   And you see, by saying that I'm excluding a great host of things, am I not?
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.080]   What if you think that Christianity, as I say, is just a teaching which tells you what
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.920]   you've got to do in order to satisfy God?
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.800]   Is that good news?
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.480]   Is the preaching of the Ten Commandments good news?
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.320]   Is the sermon on the mountain and of itself good news?
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.280]   Is it good news to you that when a man strikes you on your face, you turn the other cheek
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.640]   instead of hitting him back?
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.200]   Is that good news?
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.920]   Is it good news to tell you that if a man sues thee and takes thy coat at the law, that
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.220]   you hand him your cloak also?
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.560]   Is it good news to be told that if a man forces you to go a mile, go with him the second?
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.320]   Is that good news?
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.440]   Is it good news?
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.760]   Is it something that leads you to think in rejoicing when you're told, "Be ye therefore
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.120]   perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect"?
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.360]   Is that good news?
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.520]   You see, all these ideas of Christianity are absolutely false.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.760]   The test of the message is this.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.740]   Does it come to me as a thrilling piece of good news?
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.920]   Because if it doesn't, it's not the Christian message.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.160]   The Son of God himself, the one who claims here to be the Messiah, the one whom God tells
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:12.640]   me to listen to, tells us that he's the bearer of good news.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.200]   And when we truly hear him, he leads us to rejoice.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   Well what is this?
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:24.280]   Isn't it obvious, I say, that to many this isn't good news?
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.840]   Those people there in this synagogue of Nazareth didn't hear him truly, because you remember
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:35.040]   that afterwards they tried to throw him and kill him.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.240]   And they were but typical of the attitude of so many towards him.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.720]   My dear friends, this is the problem that confronts us at this minute.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.200]   Here is one speaking the most gracious words the world has ever heard, and speaking and
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.120]   promising good news.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.360]   And yet you see his end was to be crucified, to be rejected, to be hauled away by men,
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.240]   as it were.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.520]   What's the matter?
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   Why is it that they don't realize that he is the bringer of good news?
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.400]   Why is it that the whole world isn't rejoicing in him tonight, sitting at his feet and saying,
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.280]   "That's it, that's the very thing I've been waiting for"?
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.400]   What is it?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.080]   Why is it that he and his message are still being rejected?
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.560]   There's only one answer to the question.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.160]   It's the thing he proceeds himself to say at once.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:37.360]   He is the bearer of good news to the poor.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:44.560]   And it is only the poor who realize that his message is good news.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:51.880]   Those who realize not that they are poor and who regard themselves as rich, they see no
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   good news in his message.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.560]   They feel it's insulting.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.480]   That was the whole trouble with the Pharisees.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.320]   They were not poor.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:05.080]   They said, "We be Abraham's seed, Abraham's children, and were never yet in bondage to
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.080]   any man.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.760]   How sayest thou he shall be made free?"
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.480]   They hated him.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:25.080]   And the world in its pride laughs at him tonight and talks about sub-stuff and emotionalism
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.880]   and speaks of him and his message with disdain and with sarcasm.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.040]   Oh, it's all due to this, my friend.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:41.760]   He said himself that he'd got good news for paupers and for nobody else.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.440]   Well now, this term, therefore, is the all-important term for us this evening.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.920]   What does he mean by the poor?
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.520]   Well, the word that is here used is a very interesting word.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.240]   It doesn't just mean poverty alone.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.800]   It means much more than that.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.360]   The word that is here used carries the element of cringing, cringing.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:12.320]   Or, if you like, it's the picture of a man who's crouching as a beggar in his poverty.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.680]   That's the word that he used.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.920]   So that we've got to think of it not just as a man who casually is aware of a certain
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   need.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   It's rather the whole idea, I say, of a beggar, of a man who's humbled and who's crouching
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.080]   in his utter need and penury.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.960]   But let me give you some further definitions of what this means.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   And you realize my reason for doing this?
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.560]   If you are to realize that the Son of God has brought the greatest good news into this
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   world that it's ever heard, there is one absolute condition, and that is that you realize your
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.880]   need of him.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:09.080]   You'll never realize the good news until you see yourself and your real need.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.400]   And that is why he puts it in this word poor, and why we must be sure that we know what
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.400]   it means.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.480]   It's put like this again in the prophecy of Isaiah.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:26.800]   God says, "To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.320]   and that trembleth at my word."
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.880]   That's a definition of poverty.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:44.620]   But come let me give you some of our Lord's own definitions of what he means by this condition
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.400]   of poverty.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:53.480]   Do you remember how he starts the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.320]   Do you remember the series of beatitudes?
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   Do you remember the first?
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:05.520]   It is this, "Blessed," he says, "are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.520]   of heaven."
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.520]   That's the same thing.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   Poverty of spirit.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.400]   That's the first blessing, that's the first beatitude.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.840]   He looks out upon mankind and he says, "They are the blessed, happy are they who are poor
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.480]   in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.560]   That's another way of looking at this poverty.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   But have you noticed his invitations constantly?
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   Who does he invite to come to him?
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:41.760]   He says, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink."
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.320]   His invitation is to the thirsty.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.680]   His invitation is to the hungry.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.560]   He says, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.160]   They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick, those are the people
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.440]   he invites.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   Come unto me only that are weary and heavy laden, or that labor and are heavy laden,
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.920]   those are the people he calls to him."
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.840]   Here's the definition of poverty.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.080]   But look at it as it's put still more specifically in some of his parables.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.120]   And there I think we see it very clearly in the pictures that he draws.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.080]   Take for instance the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.360]   There it is surely in all its perfection.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.400]   That young man, the second of these two sons, he asks for his share of the goods, and his
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:36.360]   father gives it him, and away he goes from home with his pockets absolutely full of wealth
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.840]   and of affluence.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.080]   And away he goes, forgets his father, has no interest in him at all, forgot all about
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.240]   him, and went into a far country and there had his marvelous good time with his boon
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   companions.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.240]   It was simply terrific.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:56.280]   But we are told later on in the story, you remember, that he began to think of his father
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.880]   and of his home.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.240]   What made him do that, I wonder?
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.040]   The answer is very simple.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.960]   It was just this, he began to be in want.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.200]   He finds that his money is gone, the food is gone, nobody wants him, and he's sitting
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.080]   in the field with a swine and the husks, and no men gave unto him.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.240]   He's got nothing.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.320]   And then he remembers his father.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.520]   It was poverty that made him think of home.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.000]   There's one illustration.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.200]   But then our Lord gives another illustration in another parable.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.320]   He's got the parable of two debtors.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.240]   One owed a very great debt, another owed a small debt.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.960]   But this is how he puts it.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:51.440]   When they both had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.880]   That's his way of putting his message, his gospel.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.440]   Here is a man who owes money and he hasn't got a father, nothing at all.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:06.600]   That's poverty, that's the poor of whom he's speaking here in this synagogue in Nazareth.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:15.000]   It was when they had nothing wherewith to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.960]   Or take it perhaps in a still more striking manner, as he puts it in his parable of the
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   publican and the sinner who went up into the temple to pray.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.640]   And here it is of course in the form of a contrast which makes it still clearer.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.920]   Two men go up into the temple to pray.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.320]   One of them is a Pharisee and he goes as far forward as he can and he stands forward and
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:45.000]   he says, "I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men are, I'm not as this publican,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   the other men.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.720]   I fast twice in the week, I give the tenth of my goods to the poor."
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:57.680]   There's another man called a publican.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.880]   He's just inside the door.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:08.200]   He doesn't stand forward, he's there almost on his face and yet he doesn't even lift up
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:16.240]   and look towards heaven, he's so ashamed and all he can mutter through his tears is, "God,
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.800]   be merciful to me a sinner."
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.400]   And our Lord's comment is this, it's that second man, he says, who goes down to his
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.560]   house justified, not the first.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.720]   The man who's blessed of God is the second man, not the first man.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.760]   Well, the first man in a sense, he doesn't need any blessing, he's complete, isn't he?
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.000]   He's so marvelous, he doesn't ask for a thing.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   He thanks God.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.960]   He's so wonderful, he's so perfect.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.480]   He's self-existent and self-contained.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.720]   I thank thee that I am what I am and he gets nothing.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.200]   He receives nothing at all.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:59.080]   The man who receives the blessing is the man who realizes that he's an absolute pauper,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.600]   who realizes he's got no claim at all, he can make no plea, he just says, "Have mercy
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.960]   upon me, a sinner."
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.040]   Now there is our Lord's description of this very term that we're looking at together this
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.480]   evening.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.280]   In other words, it comes to this.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.800]   I am sent, he says, to preach the gospel to the poor.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   Well, who are the poor?
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:28.360]   Well, we're all poor if we but realized it, and we are poor as the result of sin.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:34.200]   The Bible says that sin makes paupers of us all.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   What is sin?
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.840]   Well, according to the Scripture, sin is that which robs us and makes us all poor.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:46.160]   Sin does to every one of us what happened to that prodigal son in that far country.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.400]   Shall I explain to you how it makes us poor?
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.880]   Look at it like this.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.920]   It makes us spiritually poor.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.880]   It robs us of certain things.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.640]   What does it rob us of?
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:09.480]   Well, the first thing that sin robs us of is our character.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:15.640]   Man was made in the image of God, perfect, upright, just, righteous.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.240]   Is he still like that?
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.840]   Are you righteous?
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.080]   Are you holy?
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.560]   Are you clean?
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.800]   Are you chaste?
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.880]   Are you pure?
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:35.280]   Have you got your character?
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.160]   Would you be perfectly willing that your character should be represented on a screen in the sight
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   of the whole world?
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.320]   And of course, your character means not only the things you do, but the things you think,
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:51.960]   the thoughts you harbor, the imaginations that you fondle, you yourself, in your inner
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.320]   life and being.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.000]   Is that as it should be?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   No, no.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.640]   Sin robs us of our character.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:07.480]   But it not only robs us of our character, it robs us of our power to resist temptation
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.680]   and evil.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:19.240]   It robs us, I say, of the power to live and to enjoy life truly.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.240]   Man was meant for happiness.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.560]   Man was meant for bliss.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:28.000]   God placed him there in paradise.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.560]   But is he in paradise now?
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.760]   No, no, we've been robbed of this.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.600]   We are robbed of life itself and the enjoyment of life.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:47.720]   Come, let me put it very simply and very directly in this form.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:54.760]   Can you really call your present existence true life?
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.800]   Are you truly happy?
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.360]   Do you feel you're living a really full life?
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.120]   If not, it's because you've been robbed of life.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.600]   That's how God made man originally, but man is no longer like that.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   Sin has robbed him.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.640]   He's been made poor.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.000]   He has no life.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.840]   He has no energy in a vital sense.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.400]   He's even been robbed of hope.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:28.920]   And you see, the poor are those who realize that that is the simple truth concerning them.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.560]   The people who really have faced themselves and have come to discover the utter emptiness
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.560]   of their lives.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.160]   It's a terrible discovery.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.840]   The vast majority of people won't face it, of course.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.520]   Like we are told about the church of the Laodiceans in the third chapter of the book of Revelation.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.160]   They think they're tremendously rich and they're not aware of their real poverty.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.040]   So there are millions of people in the world this evening.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.800]   They say, "Isn't life wonderful?"
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.240]   And what is it when you come to analyze it and to look at it?
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.600]   Can't you see that there's a great sham in this world, that people are keeping themselves
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:10.240]   on the crest of a wave, as it were, in order to avoid facing the reality?
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:16.040]   So that we are all poor in the first instance in state and in condition.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:20.520]   But still more important is our attitude.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.320]   I'll tell you who are the people who regard this gospel as the greatest thing they've
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.800]   ever heard in their lives.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.560]   I'll tell you why it is that certain men and women would forsake all the honors that the
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.840]   world can give if they were all given together in order that they might enjoy this.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.520]   I'll tell you who they are.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:45.520]   They are the people who have realized their spiritual poverty.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.440]   They are the people who realize that they are paupers in the sight of God.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.080]   And they've come to see that of themselves.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.320]   Now let me give you one perfect instance.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.120]   It's all to be seen in the life of the great apostle Paul.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:05.240]   Paul, you see, as a Pharisee, before he met the Lord Jesus Christ, he thought that he
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:10.120]   was a very wealthy man in a spiritual sense.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   Pharisee of the Pharisees.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:17.760]   Wonderful in his knowledge, living a godly and a religious life, and an expert in the
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.760]   law.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.120]   Oh, how rich he felt he was.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.120]   He boasted of his righteousness.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:30.920]   But you remember what happened when he met the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:38.200]   He saw that all that wealth which he thought he had was nothing but what he called dung
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.160]   and refuse, utterly valueless.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:48.040]   The man who thought that he was so wealthy found his great wealth with one stroke of
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:53.200]   the pen written right off, no assets whatsoever.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:38:00.760]   And he falls back helplessly on the road to Damascus and says, "What wilt thou have me
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.800]   to do, Lord?"
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.080]   A complete pauper.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.520]   Now it's to a man like that that the gospel is really good news.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.920]   It's to a man like that that the message of Jesus Christ comes as the most thrilling
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.520]   thing he's ever heard of in his life.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:26.120]   It's a man who realizes that hitherto he's only been existing and not living.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:33.080]   That he's been absolutely dependent upon things and upon people, and who realizes that when
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:39.840]   he is left to himself he really just has got nothing whatsoever to fall back upon.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.880]   And there are millions of people like that.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.800]   If they lose their loved ones, if they lose their health, if they lose their money or
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.480]   their position, they've literally got nothing.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.920]   I know people like that.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.880]   We're all like that by nature.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.120]   We live on things and people and circumstances and conditions, and when they're suddenly
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:03.040]   taken we're as helpless and as hopeless and as bereft as was the prodigal son in that
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.040]   field.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.200]   That's poverty.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:17.360]   Then we realize that we don't know God, that we've got no reserves whatsoever in our lives.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:24.920]   Oh, if only we could all see ourselves as we will be on our deathbeds without Christ,
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.840]   for this will be the position.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:34.360]   We will know for certain that we're going out of this life and out of this world.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:41.640]   We'll know it, and we'll suddenly realize that we've got nothing at all.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.200]   We are leaving behind everything we've lived for.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.160]   We look into the future, what do we see?
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.920]   Well, we don't know God.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.560]   We've never been in contact with him.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.560]   We've never met Christ.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.240]   He's not real to us.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   We've got nothing.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.120]   It's a blank.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.640]   And there we are, that's utter poverty.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.160]   That's what our Lord is speaking about.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:07.920]   He has been sent, he tells us, to preach the gospel to the poor, to men who suddenly see
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:16.040]   that all their wealth is nothing and that their righteousness is but a filthy rag.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.760]   They suddenly realize that they're beggars.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:27.240]   They are people who say, "Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.880]   Naked, come to thee for dress.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.200]   Helpless, look to thee for grace."
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.840]   Who are the poor?
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.320]   Well, the poor are the people who say, "I've been a fool, I see it now.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   I've got nothing.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.040]   I have no plea to offer.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.080]   I have nothing at all."
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.280]   My friend, where are you?
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   Do you know God?
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.680]   Have you got life?
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.040]   Have you got vitality?
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.680]   Have you got something when things have gone and when loved ones may have gone and when
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.520]   you're left alone, what are you like when you're alone?
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.520]   That's the question.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:08.280]   Now, our Lord says that he's come to give good news to people like that.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.760]   And what is the good news?
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.360]   Well, it's the most astounding thing.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.840]   Listen to some of the definitions that are given of it.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.760]   The exceeding riches of God's grace, but God who is rich in mercy for the great love wherewith
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:26.960]   he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.960]   What is the message?
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.960]   It's this.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.320]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.240]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.080]   But listen to it in these words.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.560]   What is the message of this Son of God, this Messiah?
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:51.760]   Well, according to the Apostle Paul, it can be put in these terms.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:42:07.880]   Who, though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we, through his poverty, might
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.200]   be made rich.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   What's it mean?
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   Let me put it in this form.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.400]   Here he is seated there in the synagogue of Nazareth.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.440]   He says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach the
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.440]   gospel to the poor."
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.720]   And what am I to say to them?
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.880]   I've got to say this to them.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.040]   I am the Son of God.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.080]   I share with God the wealth of glory and of eternity.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.440]   I am the Father of one.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.920]   I am the Word that was with the Father in the very beginning, through whom all things
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.480]   have been created.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.240]   I am the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:57.680]   I am eternally rich.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:04.720]   But I sit before you as the carpenter of Nazareth.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.960]   Apparently a poor man.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.040]   I don't possess a house.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.880]   He had no place whereon to lay his head.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.880]   He had nothing at all.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:18.720]   Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   to lay his head.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.720]   He's absolutely poor.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   "Look at me," he says.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.720]   What's it mean?
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:34.920]   It means this, "Though I was so rich, for your sakes I have become poor, that you, through
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.720]   my poverty, might be made rich."
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:44.520]   He comes to the poor and says, "I've come to give you the riches of God, the riches
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.120]   of heaven and of eternity.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.080]   I'm doing it in this way."
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.320]   It means this.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.760]   He has taken on him human nature.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:58.760]   He has become one of us, as it were, and he's lived our life more.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.240]   He has taken our debts upon him.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.920]   He owed God nothing.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.080]   He has never broken God's law.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.800]   He is not a debtor to God in any sense, but he has come into the world, he says, to take
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.280]   our debts upon him.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:19.960]   And our debts have made him poor, who, though he was rich for our sakes, became poor.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:25.080]   He's taken the load of our debts upon him, and he's become poor, terribly poor.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.760]   And because of that, he bears the penalty of the law upon this debt.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.600]   He dyes our debt on Calvary's hill.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   But why?
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:43.200]   Well, in order that through his poverty we might be made rich.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.520]   And how does he make us rich?
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.520]   Well, listen to it.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.520]   It's like this.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.640]   He brings us to God.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.400]   There is no such thing as spiritual riches apart from God.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.840]   You can't get it by culture.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.400]   You can't get it from philosophy.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.080]   Music won't give it to you.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:03.200]   There is only one way to be spiritually wealthy, and that is to be in contact with God.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.200]   God is the source of all riches.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.080]   He's the giver of every good and perfect gift.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.200]   And to be rich, I must be right with God.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:15.680]   Christ has come down from heaven in order to link me to God.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.960]   And thereby, he makes me rich.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   What are the riches?
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.360]   Well, here they are.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:27.200]   The first thing I need is pardon, and I get in him an abundant pardon.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   What is God?
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.720]   Well, in Christ he's abundant in mercy.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.680]   I've already quoted John 3, 16.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:39.080]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.600]   him should not, shall not perish.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.600]   He is forgiven.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:51.280]   "Come to God," says Christ, "in me, and you'll be given an abundant pardon."
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.440]   How can one make this plain or clear?
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:58.160]   Listen to this, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.720]   sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   That's the pardon.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:08.480]   "As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   us."
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   That's the message.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   That's the good news.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.120]   You're troubled about your sin, your past life, the things you've done.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.440]   You can't get rid of them.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.920]   The world can't take them away.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:23.720]   Here is one who's come down from heaven to earth to carry them away into the sea of God's
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   forgetfulness.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.720]   He's done it.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   Abundant pardon, plenteous in mercy.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:35.240]   Our hymns are full of it, are they not?
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:42.480]   "Let the healing streams abound," says Charles Wesley.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.920]   We've been singing it in our last hymn.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:52.520]   "Oh, to grace, how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to be."
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   There it is.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.800]   He's got it in all its fullness.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.760]   And in spite of us, here is the message to a pauper who can't get rid of this, the debt
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.120]   is so appalling.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.760]   Christ has come and has taken it away.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   He's no longer in the red.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   That side of the ledger has been cleared.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   It's been dealt with once and forever.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   That's the message of this gospel.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:20.200]   Because if you don't realize you're a sinner, there's no good news for you.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.280]   If you just go into the presence of God as the Pharisee went and said, "I thank thee,
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   O Lord, that I am such a fine fellow," there's no good news for you.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.360]   And you won't realize your need of good news probably until you're on your deathbed.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.360]   But then you will.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.040]   Then you'll see your righteousness for the filthy rags they are.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.840]   Then you'll see that your morality is manure.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:48.640]   Then you'll see that all your virtues are vile.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.720]   But if you've already seen what a hopeless failure you are and what a sinner in the sight
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.840]   of God, here is the good news that tells you that he came all the way from heaven to earth
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.560]   in order to delete it and take it away.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.440]   But not only that, he gives you life.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:11.240]   It isn't enough to have the account cleared on one side and the debt canceled.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.560]   That still leaves you with nothing.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.360]   "Oh, he'll set you up in business if I may go on with my illustration."
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.360]   Listen to him.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:22.040]   This is what he says, "I am come that they might have life and that they might have it
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.400]   more abundantly."
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.360]   That said to paupers, the people who've got nothing, who've got no life in them.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.760]   He says, "That's why I've come, that they might have life and that they might have it
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.840]   more abundantly, super abundance."
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:46.680]   "Him that cometh unto me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in me shall never thirst."
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:52.120]   To the woman of Samaria he says, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him as a
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:59.080]   well of water springing up into everlasting life."
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.960]   This message is not merely a message of forgiveness.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   It's a message of new life, a new birth, a new beginning.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.280]   My dear friend, I care not how dead you are.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.640]   It's the spiritual things and how helpless and hopeless.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   Come to him.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   Listen to him.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.960]   He says, "I've got a message for paupers."
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:21.200]   And the message is abundant, abounding life, life which is life indeed.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:26.280]   And is it power you need?
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:32.440]   Are you ashamed of your constant falling to the same sin and your wretched, miserable
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.080]   failure to keep your vows and your pledges and your resolutions?
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:42.480]   Listen, he gives power to the faint and to them that have no mighty increase of strength.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:51.880]   So that the apostle Paul can say without blushing, "I can do all things through Christ which
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.240]   strengthens me."
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.800]   My friend, when Christ brings you to God, he's bringing you to one of whom I can say
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   this.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:04.200]   He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   That's what's offered you.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:11.560]   This is good news, you see, for weaklings, for those who have no strength, for failures,
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.280]   for men who've been defeated by the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.640]   Oh, what a message!
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   It's a gospel.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.080]   It's good news, but only to the poor.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.720]   The self-satisfied Pharisee thanks God that he doesn't need it.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.840]   He's not like this publican, that wretched failure.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.880]   He's a success.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:39.680]   My dear friend, though you and I are living in 1955, can't you see that it's exactly the
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.080]   same?
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.600]   Wouldn't you like to live as Abram lived?
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:51.680]   Wouldn't you like to be able to look at death and beyond as Abram did?
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.360]   I've told you the secret.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:02.480]   Believe what God says about life as it is apart from him.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.240]   Come out of it.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.240]   Come out of it.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.240]   It'll never satisfy you.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:13.440]   It'll always lead to misery and unhappiness, and in the end, it'll lead to death and the
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:17.480]   judgment of God through all eternity.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.200]   Come out of it.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:28.760]   Listen to this call of God to follow Jesus Christ.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.960]   God forgives your sin and folly.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:36.560]   Christ endured the punishment of it, and God gives you free pardon.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:45.120]   He'll give you this new name, the name of his own Son, and he will lead you through
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:58.160]   life, through death, and even into the eternal city itself and its everlasting bliss and
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.960]   joy.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.200]   Come out.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   Follow him.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.040]   Amen.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
