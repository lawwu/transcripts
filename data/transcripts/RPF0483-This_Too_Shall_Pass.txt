[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800]   Flying direct with Fiji Airways.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.680]   Once upon a time in the middle of the summer toward evening when the air was clear, the
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.680]   sky bright and the dimmed sun setting, a great king was sitting in his palace roof garden.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.240]   He took enormous pleasure from the sight before his eyes as he overlooked the ancient city.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.520]   As he looked at people walking back and forth, he noticed a simple man, not from the royal
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440]   family, all dressed from head to toe with golden clothes.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.200]   He sent his messengers to summon the man.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.280]   When the man came and stood in front of him, the king asked, "Where did you get all this
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.400]   gold?
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.440]   Are you a highway robber and a murderer?"
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.920]   The man replied, "No, I would never do such a thing.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.000]   I am working with both my hands and I earn my livelihood with manual labor."
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.960]   He continued, "I am an excellent silversmith.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.920]   It is well known that our great city is considered to be the wealthiest city in the world and
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.540]   people come to trade here from the four corners of the earth.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.880]   Every day kings, ministers, and wealthy merchants come to our great city.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.680]   One has a broken ring, another a broken watch, and all of them come to me to repair these
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.080]   items and I return them as new."
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.960]   The king put his arm around the man's shoulders and said to him with a light smile on his
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.760]   lips, "If you are such a wonderful craftsman, let me test your great craftsmanship and wonderful
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.120]   wisdom and see what you can do.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.920]   I command you, a royal command, to make for me such a wonderful ring that will be able
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.460]   to affect a man spiritually, changing his mood of the moment.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.240]   If the man is happy, he will become sad when he looks at the ring, and if he is sad and
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.820]   worried, the ring will change his mood and he will become happy.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.720]   If you can show me this, then I will reward you as befits your skill and wisdom.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.060]   If you cannot fulfill my command, I will cut off your head."
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.260]   The silversmith asked the king to give him three days' time.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.600]   In his craftsmanship he had done many strange and different rings, but he did not even know
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   how and where to start for such a work.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.440]   He grieved greatly, for he feared death.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.720]   After three days, he went to the wise king, bringing with him several rings to show the
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.720]   king.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.720]   He reached the royal palace and found the king's son sitting in the front room.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.840]   When the prince saw the silversmith and his ashen face, he asked, "Why are you so miserable?"
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.480]   The silversmith answered him, "I am walking to the king trembling and my knees are knocking.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.120]   I am bringing to the king a golden ring, but I doubt whether the king would like this expensive
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.280]   ring."
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.640]   He told the prince that the king had asked him to make a ring that would change a man's
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.240]   mood every time, but he did not know how to make such a ring.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.540]   When the prince heard these matters, he said, "Put one ring on my finger, and I will show
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.440]   you how to make it."
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.800]   The silversmith gave him one ring, and the prince put it on his finger.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:30.280]   He took a nail and engraved on the ring three letters, G-Z-Y, in Hebrew, Gemel, Zayin, Yad,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.880]   each at a different point on the ring.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.360]   He said, "Take this ring to the king, and he will favor you and will give you many presents
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.640]   and will not punish you."
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.140]   The silversmith happily went to the king with the ring.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.900]   When the great king examined the ring carefully, he recognized the three letters at the three
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.540]   points on the ring, and the wise king, for whom all mysteries and secrets are revealed
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.420]   and known and understood, read it and understood the wise hint, Gam, Zay, Ya'avor, which in
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.880]   Hebrew means "This too will pass."
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.400]   When the king examined the ring with the initials G-Z-Y, he applied it to himself, "This too
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.820]   will pass."
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.720]   That is to say that, although now I am at the highest rank, a king of the whole world
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.620]   and can enjoy all kinds of pleasures, this will not last forever, and my huge success
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.940]   will not last always.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.740]   When such thoughts came to the king's mind, he immediately grieved very much, and indeed
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.700]   it befell him exactly as he interpreted it.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.300]   A great trouble came upon him, demoting him from his high position, and it came to pass
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.380]   that the king lost his crown and wandered as a beggar in remote lands.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.220]   And when the great king in his poverty looked at the ring on his finger and read the initials
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.300]   G-Z-Y, "This too shall pass," he said to him, "The trouble that came upon me will not last
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.960]   forever, and I hope one day to return and gain to be the king on a high throne."
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.500]   And so it happened.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.140]   This story my wife hates, but I find encouraging.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.460]   Now there are various, there are many versions of this story.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.260]   There's just one that I thought was evocatively written to read to you today.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.020]   But the fundamental value is in the wisdom of the words, "This too shall pass."
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.500]   And I've had a tough past couple of weeks, and I've been sick the last week.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.620]   It just knocked me down flat, compounded that on all the challenges from the hurricane and
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.620]   all of that, and just had a tough couple of weeks.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.380]   And yet I don't regret those things.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.220]   I actually often appreciate it when I am sick, because it allows me to have more empathy
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.020]   and compassion for others for whom being sick is a way of life.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.620]   I'm rarely sick, and when I am, it's generally not grossly debilitating.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.700]   And I am able to appreciate again how easy it is to be positive and energetic and upbeat
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.540]   when you feel well, and how challenging it is when you don't feel well.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.380]   And so I appreciate being sick.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.820]   But it's just caused me to be back on almost everything, to be behind on almost everything.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.180]   Have you ever been there?
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.180]   I'm sure you have.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.220]   And I want to just encourage you for a few moments that when you're in the middle of
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.460]   the challenges, encourage yourself, "This too shall pass."
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:29.460]   We talk a lot about money, and I try very hard to make sure that most of my content,
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:37.900]   most of my product that I create for you here is positive and upbeat and motivated.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.860]   I try very hard not to complain.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.500]   I try hard not to keep things negative and to just bring a downer mood.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.220]   So I do my best to make this show a positive and energetic place for you, a place where
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.420]   you can come and be confident that you'll walk away encouraged.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.980]   That's intentional on my part.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.380]   But you know what?
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.620]   Life's not always like that.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.540]   Life's not always positive and upbeat.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.540]   Life is hard.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.180]   It can be grueling.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.580]   And when you're in the middle of a financial journey, there are parts that are really exciting
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.700]   and euphoric.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:21.180]   But there are times of most of our financial journeys that are very difficult, draining,
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.660]   grueling, tiring.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.940]   Perhaps this is most dramatically seen when perhaps you're in the middle of working your
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.940]   way out of debt.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.380]   It's easy to fall into debt.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.260]   Nobody falls out of debt.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.940]   I know when I've been there multiple times throughout my life just seeking to work my
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.500]   way out of debt, I found that often I'm just tired all the time, working hard.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:54.060]   If you're in that situation, I want to encourage you that this too shall pass.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.140]   Life's not always going to be difficult and draining like it is now.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.460]   That's just the phase that you're in.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.660]   Or perhaps you're in a phase at which you're saving aggressively for a goal.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.220]   You're in a phase of working.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.860]   You're not in a phase of resting and spending.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.300]   You're in a phase of working and accumulating.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.300]   That's right.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   That's good.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.300]   It's tough.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.420]   It's okay.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.400]   You'll get through it.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.980]   Or perhaps you're in a phase of business where things are not looking so good.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.060]   Your markets are changing.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.820]   Your customers are changing.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:32.380]   You're struggling with your ability to deliver new products and services in a changing world.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.500]   It's tough.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.500]   Businesses go bankrupt.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.540]   People go out of business all the time.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.860]   And you might be in that situation.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.900]   I always find it encouraging to recognize this too shall pass.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:52.580]   Now, I said my wife doesn't like the phrase I'm prone to often say when we're in the middle
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.580]   of a challenge.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.580]   She says, "This too shall pass."
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.220]   And she's, "What does that even mean?"
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.820]   It doesn't help anything to say, "This too shall pass."
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.300]   I want to solve the problem here and now.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.020]   So maybe that's not as meaningful for you as it is for me.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.820]   But I often find comfort in the fact of just knowing this too shall pass.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:15.900]   We can face almost anything, almost any trial, almost any struggle for the short term, especially
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.820]   if we know that there's light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.820]   This too shall pass.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.300]   And I want to promise you, no matter where you are and no matter the path that you're
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:27.380]   walking, there have been other people who have been there, been there in the trenches
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:34.140]   with you, been there sick, been there when they couldn't deliver what they wanted to
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:41.680]   deliver, been there when they're working late, up early, and they're tired, just want a break.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.060]   When they see all their friends all around who were seemingly living the good life and
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.380]   they don't feel it quite so much.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.820]   A lot of people have been there.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:02.380]   But I also want to encourage you with another story, which is to say, don't just focus on
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.940]   this too shall pass.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:12.020]   Appreciate what you're learning in the middle of the process.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.020]   Once upon a time, a man was sleeping at night in his cabin when suddenly his room was filled
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.380]   with a bright light and the Lord appeared to him.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.420]   The Lord told the man that he had work for him to do.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.880]   He showed him a large rock right in front of his cabin.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.980]   And the Lord explained that the man was to push against the rock with all his might.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.860]   This the man did day after day.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:38.660]   For many years, he toiled from sunup to sundown with his shoulders set squarely against the
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.260]   cold massive surface of the unmoving rock, pushing with all his might.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.620]   Each night, the man returned to his cabin sore, worn out, feeling that his whole day
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.420]   had been spent in vain.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.220]   Seeing that the man was showing signs of discouragement, the great adversary decided to enter the picture
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.700]   by placing thoughts into the man's weary mind.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.220]   You've been pushing against that rock for a long time and it hasn't budged.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.020]   Why kill yourself over this?
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.620]   You're never going to move it.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.260]   Thus, this gave the man the impression that the task was impossible and that he was a
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.540]   failure.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.140]   These thoughts discouraged and disheartened the man.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.460]   Why kill myself over this?
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.460]   He thought.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.580]   I'll just put in my time, giving just the minimum effort, and that'll be good enough.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.900]   And that's just what he planned to do.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.940]   That is, until one day he decided to make it a matter of prayer and take his troubled
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.940]   thoughts to the Lord.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.540]   Lord, he said, I've labored long and hard in your service.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.980]   I've been putting all my strength to do that which you've asked.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.340]   Yet after all this time, I haven't even budged that rock by half a millimeter.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.560]   What's wrong?
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.420]   Why am I failing?
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.900]   The Lord responded compassionately.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.580]   My friend, when I asked you to serve me, you accepted.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.620]   I told you that your task was to push against the rock with all your strength, which you've
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.820]   done.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.580]   Never once did I mention to you that I expected you to move it.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.180]   Your task was to push, and now you come to me with your strength spent thinking that
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.620]   you've failed.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.700]   But is that really so?
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.100]   Look at yourself.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.800]   Your arms are strong and muscular.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.640]   Your back sinew is mighty, and your hands are calloused from the constant pressure.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.860]   Your legs have become massive and hard.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.980]   Through opposition you've grown much, and your abilities now surpass that which you
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.800]   used to have.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.140]   Yet you haven't moved the rock.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.220]   But your calling was to be obedient and to push.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.220]   You were to exercise your faith and trust.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.220]   This you've done.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.460]   I will now move the rock.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.620]   I don't usually go much for kind of pop sugar, feel good religious stories.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.300]   And if I could dereligiousize that one, I probably would just to, not that it doesn't
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.180]   make a valid truth, but I feel sometimes like they're just too trite.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.820]   But since I heard that story some years ago, it just really impressed me, and I've often
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.980]   thought back to it.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:06.060]   And I've often thought, am I learning something while I'm pushing against the rock?
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.340]   When you think about the challenges that life throws at you, you think about just the challenges,
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.020]   the things that you can't actually do.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:17.020]   We're never promised success in any particular venture.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.260]   You may push and push against the rock.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.820]   You may push and push to pay off your debt and ultimately be pressed by your creditors
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.660]   right into bankruptcy.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.540]   You may push and push to save money and ultimately never get to your goal.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.580]   You may push and push to build a business and ultimately have it collapse and crumble
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.780]   right underneath you.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.140]   All those things are entirely possible, and they've happened to better men than you and
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.420]   me, better women than you.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:55.500]   Those things are entirely possible.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.900]   But on the flip side, will you look down and see that your hands have become more calloused
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.820]   and your muscles stronger?
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:08.980]   Well, if you've pushed diligently against the rock, you'll learn from that mistake.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.500]   You'll learn from those circumstances.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:19.580]   And I'll go with you to your next thing.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.060]   So don't think that just because you're facing adversity, you can take comfort in the idea
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:30.340]   that this too shall pass and then ignore the current circumstances.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:38.580]   Think that the way that you handle your current adversity will make a difference in you, and
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.020]   the lessons that you learn and what you're facing right now will move on and will go
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.660]   with you for the rest of your life.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.620]   I always love that little saying, "How you do anything is how you do everything."
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.780]   And I've found it to be true.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.940]   How you do anything is how you do everything.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.540]   You can't be committed in some areas and then think that that commitment won't reflect through
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.380]   on other areas.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:06.540]   You can't fake it and just show up in some areas and not show up in others.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.940]   How you do anything is how you do everything.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:16.180]   And so I close today's little motivational monologue, I guess this has been, with a simple
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.180]   encouragement.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:25.340]   If you find yourself in a dark place or in a hard place, recognize that this too shall
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.260]   pass and if you keep on working, you'll come through it.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.140]   Things will look brighter in the morning.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.820]   Don't think that everybody else doesn't go through exactly what you're facing.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.260]   Don't think that everyone else's lives are just great.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.540]   People feel great all the time.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.620]   They're positive and upbeat and ready to go all the time.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.420]   It's not true.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:57.580]   Every motivational guru, every prominent politician, every community leader, business
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:06.260]   leader, every one of your friends, everyone you know has tough days, tough weeks, tough
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.660]   months, tough years.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.660]   That's life.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.820]   If you're in a tough financial spot, join the club.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.260]   Just about all of us have been there.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.500]   Just about all of us will be there again.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:24.580]   The scale may change, but tough times come and go.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.580]   So don't give up.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.580]   Keep pressing on.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:34.420]   Recognize this too shall pass and focus on passing through it the very best that you
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.100]   can because that'll do a work in you.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.220]   Facing adversity, facing trial, facing difficult times will do a work in you.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:50.780]   When I look back at my life over the last 20 years, the times that have been the most
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:58.660]   transformative for me have been the most difficult.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:05.380]   The times in my life over the last 20 years that have been the most transformative have
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:11.340]   been the most difficult.
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:16.300]   Ask any successful person, they'll tell you the same thing.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.500]   It's not fun, it's not easy when you're in the middle of it.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.300]   Requires growth, requires changes.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.580]   If what you're doing isn't working, it may be time to sit down and say, "Should I quit
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.140]   and do something else?"
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.340]   Let's change the tactics, but don't quit the effort.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.340]   Just refocus.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.100]   Anyway, that's all I got for you.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.540]   I wanted to share this.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.660]   I feel like it's valuable.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.140]   People like me do things who, again, come to a microphone every day when things are
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.620]   going great.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.700]   If we don't show up to a microphone during some of the times when things are tough, again,
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:00.700]   just facing sickness, it's knocked me back.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.180]   I think oftentimes it leads to an unbalanced idea.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:09.820]   I just wanted to share those short little thoughts with you and encourage you.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:16.340]   I hope this was more than just fluffy, positive-sounding motivational ideas.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.540]   These are some principles that I think do have value.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:25.900]   Even though they're couched in the middle of some fluffy stories and feel-good medicine,
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.620]   I guess, these things are real and they're encouraging to me.
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.620]   I am doing better.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.620]   I'm sorry I've been away this week.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.900]   I haven't been able to talk for much of the week, but I'm doing better now.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:44.460]   My voice is about 80-85% recovered, and I'll be back with you on Monday morning to help
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:50.860]   you build the knowledge, skills, insight, encouragement that you need each day, especially
