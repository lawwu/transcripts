[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   A really good question today from a listener named Derek in Chicago.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.320]   "Pastor John, I have been a Christian for about a decade and it has been a wonderful
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.400]   decade of growth and learning in Scripture.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.880]   I feel close to God.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.360]   I know God loves me and the shed blood of His Son proves it according to Romans 8.32.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.800]   But the question I more often struggle with is this.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.760]   Does God actually like me?
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.080]   Pastor John, what would you say to Derek?"
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.920]   This is not just Derek's question.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.600]   Many ask the same thing.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:49.200]   It often goes hand in hand with a family background in which there is no experience of being enjoyed.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.520]   A father or mother or others who basically coexisted with us or tolerated us but rarely
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.960]   seemed to delight in us or want to be with us or take genuine, spontaneous pleasure in
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.000]   anything we did or said.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.040]   In other words, there are a lot of people who, from their own experience, have no actual
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:22.120]   existential categories for grasping the fact of someone, anyone, God included, liking them
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.080]   or enjoying them or delighting in them.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.360]   So it seems to me that what's needed for a person like that, and it may be most of us,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.720]   what's needed is to discover an actual experience of being enjoyed by God and pleasing God and
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.060]   God smiling upon us and having pleasure in us.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.360]   What's needed for that to happen is three things.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.160]   One, a framework for understanding the love of God in its different dimensions.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.760]   Two, a big bath of biblical text.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.120]   Dive in, take a bath in the Bible about God's delighting in His people.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   And three, a specific outpouring of the Holy Spirit that I can't control and that Derek
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.520]   can't control, but God may be pleased to give through His Word in which the heart experiences
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.320]   this not just as a biblical truth, but as a personal reality.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   So those three things.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.600]   Let me just say a word about each of those three things.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.780]   First, here's the simple framework for understanding several dimensions of the love of God.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.200]   There are at least two dimensions to God's love, and there are probably subcategories
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.640]   of those, but here are two.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.440]   One has been called the love of benevolence.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.600]   This would be God's goodwillâ€”benevolence means goodwill toward people that don't deserve
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   it.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.080]   This is the kind of love that saved all of us who have any hope of making heaven.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.200]   We got that hope because God looked upon us when we were not beautiful, not attractive,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.640]   not pleasing.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:20.040]   He saw lostness and hopelessness and rebelliousness and dirty character and undeserving merit,
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.820]   no merit, and He loved us with a love of benevolence that saved us from destruction when we were
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.880]   running full speed away from Him.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.520]   That's the love of benevolence, and none of us would have a relationship with God without
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   it.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.920]   And then there is the love of delight or approval or being pleased or what Derek probably
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.100]   means by being liked.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.840]   When God created the world, including human beings, and said, "It is very good.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.880]   This is good," this was the love of delight.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.360]   He saw what He had made, and He approved of it.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.720]   He was pleased by it.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.000]   He liked it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.680]   Yet when human beings, and that's all of us, fell into sin, God's human creation was
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.840]   marred, defaced, made ugly, displeasing, even though there is a remnant of natural wonder
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.440]   about the human person that distinguishes us from the animals, but we're so defaced
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:42.280]   and so debased that God finds us thoroughly unpleasing when it comes to a personal relationship.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.640]   But here's the amazing thing.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:53.000]   When God, by His love of benevolence, saves us and counts us righteous in Christ and gives
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.680]   us the Holy Spirit, He begins a work of transformation that restores aspects of our personhood which
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:12.000]   are delightful to Him, pleasing to Him, which He genuinely likes about us.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.700]   This is what God is doing in sanctification.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.160]   You might say sanctification is God making us likable, pleasing.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.080]   So that's the first thing of the three that I mentioned.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.640]   Number two, now let's turn and take a bath.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:37.000]   But before the bath, here's a Bible text that describes this decisive turn from being unable
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.800]   to please God, be liked by God, and able to be liked by God.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.120]   And it's Romans 8, 7 through 9.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.760]   It goes like this, "The mind that is set on the flesh," that's who we were, the mind of
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.680]   the flesh, before we were born again.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.720]   "The mind of the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.880]   It does not submit to God's law.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.800]   Indeed, it cannot, and those who are in the flesh," here it is, "cannot please God."
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.780]   So this is our hopeless condition.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:17.460]   We were in an absolutely hopeless state apart from salvation.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.720]   We never pleased God.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.080]   He never liked what we did because everything we did was not from faith.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.360]   It was rooted in pride and rooted in selfishness and rooted in vainglory and seeking our own
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.380]   and ignoring Him, and that didn't please Him at all.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.240]   But here's the amazing transition.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.300]   The verse picks up like this, "But you, however, are not in the flesh."
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.380]   So he just said, "In the flesh you cannot please God, but you, however, are not in the
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.020]   flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you."
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.380]   In other words, you were without the Spirit and could not please God.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.100]   Now you have the Spirit, and by implication you do please God.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:15.580]   God does not give us His Spirit in vain, and the Spirit does not produce unlikable fruit.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:23.940]   God delights in, is pleased by, what we are becoming in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:29.460]   And I know this is hard to believe and hard to feel for many people because our experience
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.120]   is that if there's any part of our lives that is imperfect, that's what others are going
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.940]   to pick up on and complain about.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.260]   They're not going to spot anything good and like us for it.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.580]   They're going to spot what we haven't yet accomplished for goodness, and they're going
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:51.960]   to be displeased by it, and that's especially true of God, people feel.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:58.860]   We can never really be liked, only tolerated, because the focus is always on our shortcomings
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.260]   rather than our little successes.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:09.420]   But I want to say loud and clear, God is not like that.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.020]   Let me say it again.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.960]   God is not like that.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:23.340]   God sees the incremental advances of our transformation by the Spirit, His Spirit, and delights in
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.700]   them.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.820]   God does not decide whom to like quantitatively.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.820]   This is important.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.980]   Listen carefully.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:38.660]   He doesn't decide whom He's going to like quantitatively, as if when you get to 51%
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.740]   goodness, He'll like you.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:48.260]   Finally, when you are at 49%, He doesn't like you.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:09:00.540]   What God sees in us is not quantity, but real Holy Spirit-produced fruit.
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:10.780]   Even of these little evidences of new, real, spiritual, regenerate life are a great delight
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.200]   to Him.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.600]   They are a real good, even if mixed with sinful attitudes.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.980]   How could they not be His pleasure?
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.980]   They are His work.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.980]   I mean, how demeaning can it be to say to the work of the Holy Spirit, "God doesn't
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.980]   like it"?
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.380]   That's awful for people to say that.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.660]   So here's the bath.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.820]   Psalm 3527, "Great is the Lord who delights in the welfare of His servant."
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:45.560]   Jeremiah 3240, "I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.740]   faithfulness with all my heart and all my soul."
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.060]   Zephaniah 317, "God will rejoice over you with gladness.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.820]   He will quiet you by His love.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.620]   He will exult over you with loud singing."
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:06.260]   Proverbs 1120, "Those of crooked heart are an abomination to the Lord, but those of blameless
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.820]   ways are His delight."
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:17.540]   Isaiah 624, "You shall be called, 'My delight is in her,' and your land married.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.740]   For the Lord delights in you, and your land shall be married."
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:30.140]   Psalm 147.10, "His delight is not in the strength of the horse or His pleasure in the legs of
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:38.620]   a man, but the Lord takes pleasure in those who fear Him, in those who hope in His steadfast
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.620]   love."
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.700]   All you have to do is hope in God and tremble at His displeasure, and you are a delight
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.700]   to Him.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:52.580]   Proverbs 311, "The Lord reproves whom He loves as a father the son in whom He delights."
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:58.340]   So even when we're being reproved, He calls us the son in whom He delights.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.900]   One more, Psalm 149.4, "For the Lord takes pleasure in His people.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.780]   He adorns the humble with salvation."
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.460]   And that Bible bath could go on and on.
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:17.460]   Just one last thing, number three, none of these glorious texts will make a difference
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:23.500]   in Derek's life without the upholding of the Holy Spirit in his heart to make this a personal
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.260]   experience.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:32.480]   So he and we should pray earnestly that Romans 5:5 happen when I'm done here, or maybe it's
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.460]   happening right now, but we pray that it will.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:43.060]   It says, "God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.980]   been given to us."
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.420]   That's a real experience.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:54.780]   When this happens, all those texts come alive as personal experiences, not just biblical
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.780]   truth.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:03.700]   So I pray, Derek, I pray that for you and the rest of us who want to please God, want
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:12.340]   God to delight in us, be pleased with us, like what we are and what we do, I pray that
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.580]   God would pour out His Holy Spirit and make these texts real.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.580]   Amen.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.260]   That's quite a bath of biblical truth.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.520]   And Derek, thanks for the excellent question.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.540]   And speaking of truth baths, you can subscribe to our audio feed and search our episode archive
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.940]   and even reach us by email with a difficult question you might be facing in life.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:40.580]   You can do all of that through our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.300]   Well what does it mean for me to give my life to God?
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.260]   How do we give our lives to God?
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.900]   The phrase is fairly common today in Christian jargon.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:56.420]   And on Wednesday, we will press in for a definition of the phrase according to scripture as we
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.820]   are called to give our lives to Him.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.420]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.820]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.540]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:13.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.940]   you
