[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.160]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.960]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.960]   I am your host.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.200]   And today I want to create for you a short episode, just a simple conversation on the
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.640]   subject of safety.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.880]   Received a comment on the previous show where I talked about how to move to Mexico and why
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.880]   you should.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.320]   I received a question, which I think is certainly quite widespread.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.480]   The commenter asked, "Well, no discussion on safety?
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.800]   I'm interested in moving to Mexico, but my wife really doesn't like the sound of it."
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.560]   And of course, we hear so many difficult things about Mexico.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.000]   And I definitely do think it deserves a conversation.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.640]   In fact, I've already recorded an interview, which will be released in a few days, where
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.680]   we do, I do mention it with another guy who was living in San Miguel de Allende also.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.080]   But I thought this is important enough for me to just talk with you firsthand, straightforwardly
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.760]   about the topic of safety.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.720]   And I think it's definitely an important component of good financial planning.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.320]   The older I get, the more important safety is to me.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.000]   I've talked about this throughout the annals of the show.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.800]   I've talked about the importance of safety gear.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.300]   I did a show on just simply wearing the safety gear on how if you're going to be involved
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.960]   in something and you're going to go and do something as simple, put on a helmet, right?
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.000]   Put on a skiing helmet, put on a bicycle helmet, don't work on ladders.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.440]   It's silly to build wealth and then wind up hurting yourself in some simple way.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.720]   When I was younger, I did all kinds of, I worked on roofs, I re-roofed houses, et cetera.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.880]   The older I get, the more I look at it and just say, "It's just not worth it.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.360]   Why would it be worth it for me to go up there and expose myself to some physical danger?"
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.520]   And so I've done shows on that.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.760]   I've talked about how it becomes more important for you to invest in safety, things like driving
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.160]   a safer car.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.360]   I think that one of the values of having money is that you can afford a safer car and it's
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.880]   worth having.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.480]   Driving is one of the most dangerous things that you and I probably do on a regular basis
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.280]   and having a car that has active safety features, collision avoidance systems, et cetera, and
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.280]   passive safety features, high quality airbags, high quality construction.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   To me, it's worth it.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.080]   There was a time in my life where I drove a cheap car and then I realized that I didn't
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.560]   really want to drive my cheap car because even though it gave me a great story, "Look,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.200]   I've got this super reliable $500 car.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.400]   My old Toyota Corolla that I paid $500 for," I realized that it wasn't ideal for me from
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   a safety perspective.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.380]   So now that brings us to travel.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.920]   How should you think about safety when it comes to different places in the world that
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.380]   you can go?
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.600]   My answer is I think you should think about it, but I think you should think about it
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.880]   accurately.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.440]   One big benefit of building wealth is that you can move from an unsafe place to a safe
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.040]   place.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.380]   And here you'll have to define what those terms mean.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.000]   But I do often wonder, there are many places, even in the United States, there are many
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.400]   places where people go to bed at night wondering if a stray bullet is going to come through
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.920]   the walls of their house and hit one of their children in the bed while they're sleeping.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.720]   You can hear stories of New York City back in the 1980s when people would put their children
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.900]   to sleep in a bathtub for protection through the walls.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.960]   Now is that true or is that apocryphal?
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.880]   I don't know.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.500]   But certainly there's a sense in which it rings true.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.360]   You see the number of people killed every weekend in a city like Chicago and you know
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.920]   that some of them are just simply accidental deaths.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.840]   And I've often wondered, why don't people move?
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   Anybody can move.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.920]   Anybody living in a bad neighborhood in Chicago can leave a bad neighborhood in Chicago and
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.760]   go to a place in Indiana or just in a different neighborhood in Chicago.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.880]   Number of reasons people don't take action.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.680]   But one reason people don't take action is economics.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.880]   And so one big benefit of building your wealth is that it opens up to you more economic possibilities.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.440]   You open up for yourself the ability to go from a place that is unsafe to a place that
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.360]   is safe.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.580]   I think that this can and should be part of your personal planning even in the city where
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.580]   you live.
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:30.080]   I keep a list of things that over the years I've changed my mind about and things that
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.240]   I've been wrong about, things I've changed my mind about just so I can kind of have a
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.000]   good track about them.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.320]   One of the things on that list, things that I have changed my mind about is the usefulness
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.080]   and importance of a gated neighborhood.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.960]   Now I'm still a little bit loath to admit this one, but I certainly think a lot more
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.120]   about it, especially as I watch what happens in my home country, the United States and
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.000]   the increasing levels of violence, the increasing levels of tension, just the things that you
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.360]   see on a news program quite regularly.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.120]   If you had asked me five years ago if I would ever live in a gated neighborhood, my answer
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.880]   would have been an unequivocal absolutely not, never, because I don't want to deal with
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.720]   the additional restrictions, the additional constraints that come with that particular
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   style of living.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.600]   However, as I watch what has happened in the United States over the last few years, I don't
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.800]   want people marching through my street right in front of my house.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.460]   I don't want to wake up in the morning and have my house surrounded by people yelling
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.320]   at me and people blocking intersections and whatnot.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.800]   This is one reason why people move to a gated neighborhood.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.080]   I think there can be a substantial increase in safety by simply choosing to move to a
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.760]   gated neighborhood, and it's worth considering.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.280]   There are expressions of this.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.480]   Now is it necessary to do that, to be safe in a little town in the United States?
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.240]   No, it's not, but it is the kind of thing that happens.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.980]   I think that that particular trend will grow significantly in the coming years.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:10.580]   If you go to a country that is generally considered to be less safe, you will find that living
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.700]   in a gated neighborhood is basically the standard for anybody with any particular level of wealth
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.120]   because it provides you a significant level of safety and protection at a modest cost.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.200]   Virtually everybody lives in a gated neighborhood where there's a guard at the front, a wall
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.240]   around the set of properties, and then of course sometimes you have a guard on your
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.120]   own personal property.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.760]   I think that trend will continue to grow in the United States for people who have wealth
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.920]   as well as you see some of the increasing levels of violence and increasing levels of
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.560]   disruption in society.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   What about Mexico?
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.240]   I think when you get to safety of traveling, you get into a different world because there's
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.860]   just a different perspective on what's safe and what's not.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.560]   Over the years, I've been on various sides of this issue.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.720]   I'll tell you a couple of stories.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:11.280]   I remember when I was just graduating from college and I wanted to take a trip somewhere,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.720]   wanted to travel abroad, didn't have very much money.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.480]   I sat down and I said, "Where can I fly?"
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.960]   Spirit Airlines had a flight to Haiti that was cheap and Spirit Airlines had a flight
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.680]   to Colombia that was cheap.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.040]   I didn't know much about both places, but of course I knew that Colombia was unsafe.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.960]   After all, it's a drug country and a terrible place to be, etc.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.920]   I knew that Haiti was a little bit questionable, so I pulled up the U.S. State Department,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.120]   looked at their travel advisory warnings, and they warned against traveling to Haiti.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.560]   I said, "Well, I'll take a risk on Colombia."
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.840]   I bought a plane ticket to Colombia and showed up, didn't know much about it, went to a hostel
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.040]   and had a great trip.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.400]   Had a wonderful time, didn't get robbed, everything was totally fine, and really enjoyed
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   my time there.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.360]   That was one time when I started to say, "Wait a second, what's going on?
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.040]   Why are there all these warnings?
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.640]   Why do I have this wrong view of Colombia?
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.360]   Why do I think that Colombia is this godforsaken hellhole, when in reality this has just been
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.600]   an awesome trip and this is a wonderful place to be?"
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   It changed me.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.680]   Earlier than that, I'll tell you another example.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.320]   One thing I have learned throughout my life is that virtually every country that I've
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.280]   ever been to doesn't trust its own neighbors, whether they're racist towards their neighbors,
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.840]   or whether they just don't like them, or whether they have arguments against them.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.400]   Virtually every country I've been to has a hard time with their neighbors.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.840]   When I was in college in Costa Rica, we went to Nicaragua.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.560]   All the Costa Ricans start warning you about Nicaragua, about how terrible Nicaragua is,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.600]   how unsafe it is, be careful, it's just full of crime.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.280]   Costa Ricans and Nicaraguans have a very difficult relationship.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.600]   They don't really like each other very much.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   All you hear is just how bad Nicaragua is.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.200]   Well, then you go to Nicaragua and it's nothing like what the Costa Ricans warned you about,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.080]   at least your experience of it is not.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.720]   I didn't get robbed in Nicaragua, I did get robbed in Costa Rica.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.800]   Yet the Costa Ricans would never hear that.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.200]   I've seen this again and again throughout my life.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.400]   When my wife and I were on our honeymoon, we had a honeymoon in Hispaniola.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.080]   It's not abnormal to go to the Dominican Republic, as we did and go to a resort.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.800]   What is abnormal is we also went to Haiti.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.880]   I remember when we told people in the Dominican Republic, "We're going to Haiti.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   It's terrible.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.520]   The Haitians, you can't trust them.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.520]   It's dangerous.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   Be really careful.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   It's super dangerous."
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.400]   While we did not like Haiti, which I'll talk about in a moment, I didn't find it particularly
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   dangerous.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.880]   I think there was more danger there, certainly, but we didn't get robbed, we didn't get hurt.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880]   We escaped.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.720]   It's just again and again and again, almost anywhere I go, I find the same thing.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.600]   I've come to basically distrust most of those opinions.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.520]   What about Mexico?
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.000]   Mexico certainly has a reputation for violence and for lack of safety.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.480]   I don't personally think that reputation is unwarranted.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.280]   I do think it's important to pay attention to.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.960]   I remember a number of years ago, I was listening to a presentation by a guy who was a celebrity
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.480]   bodyguard type.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.760]   His comment was, "Don't ever go to Mexico.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   Don't ever go to Mexico.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.480]   If you don't ever go to Mexico, you're going to be safe."
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.080]   You file that stuff away in your head and you think, "Man, that sounds really bad.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.240]   I don't want to be dumb.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   I don't want to die.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.640]   I don't want to be locked up in prison somewhere.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   I don't want to be robbed.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.120]   Maybe I just won't go to Mexico."
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.960]   But in reality, I've been in Mexico for some time, traveling all around.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.960]   I've been in Mexico City over the last week, Mexico City, Cuernavaca, San Miguel de Allende.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.560]   I'm in Cancun, Playa del Carmen right now.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.440]   I haven't once thought about physical safety.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.720]   I haven't once been concerned about physical safety.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.400]   I want the same for you.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.960]   Let me give you my formula for how to think about physical safety.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.440]   The first thing is you should be aware of what the statistics indicate because data
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.020]   does tell an important story.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.080]   But data only tells an important story if you actually understand how to read the data.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.560]   I'll give you an example from the United States.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.760]   The United States has a much higher level of violence than many places in the world,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.800]   a much higher level of murders, a much higher level of violence than many places in the
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.320]   world.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.600]   The challenge is that the vast majority of that violence takes place in just a handful
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.680]   of cities, a handful of large liberal cities where there's the most violence.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.800]   Now you notice I put the political commentary, I said liberal cities.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.240]   You can do this because you can study this with things like gun violence.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.540]   If you're ever looking at gun violence in the United States, one of the first things
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.920]   that you want to look at is say, "Where is this gun violence happening?"
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.040]   And the gun violence in the United States happens in large democratic cities that have
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.320]   strict gun laws, that's where all the gun violence happens.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.240]   And people argue and argue about this, but the reality is if you take those handful of
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.560]   cities out of the United States, you take those handful of cities such as Chicago, New
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.080]   York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., you just remove those from all the statistics, the
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.040]   United States drops to one of the safest countries in the world as long as you get rid of those
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.240]   cities.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.140]   So let's say that somebody's planning to come to the United States.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.460]   You can tell them and they say, "I'm concerned about violence in the United States.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.960]   After all, there's tremendous levels of violence and I'm not sure, am I going to be safe?"
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.560]   Well, a good statistical answer would be, "Yeah, you can be safe, but don't go to Chicago,
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.480]   don't go to New York, don't go to Washington, D.C., don't go to Baltimore.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.920]   Stay out of the big cities and you'll be fine."
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.760]   Now is that true?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:54.040]   Statistically it's true, but you also know there's a whole other side to the story.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:06.180]   You know that that's not all of it.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:12.520]   You know that it's more important to think about what parts of those cities.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.880]   You can go to Chicago and you can have a wonderful time and never once see any indication of
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:24.040]   violence anywhere in Chicago because you simply don't go to certain neighborhoods.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.160]   You stay in the places where there's not trouble.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.660]   Same thing in any city.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.680]   And so I would be happy to tell a tourist to the United States, "Yeah, go to Chicago.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.720]   Just pay attention to what the people say."
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.320]   And you know that if somebody's going to go to Chicago and they ask, "Hey, is it okay
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   for me?
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.400]   I'm a visitor from England.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.640]   Is it okay for me to go shopping in this particular district?"
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.720]   The answer is almost certainly yes.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.280]   Almost certainly it's absolutely fine and you can definitely go and shop there in that
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.540]   district.
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.600]   So you want to pay attention to neighborhoods.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.520]   But what's also important in terms of safety is...
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.960]   Well, let's go first just listen to people on the ground.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.000]   Let's talk about a city like, say, Portland.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.520]   Is Portland, Oregon known for being a particularly dangerous city?
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.640]   I would say no, it's a beautiful city.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.520]   It's not known for being a particularly dangerous city.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.480]   But if you were to go to Portland, Oregon today, would it be wise to talk to the concierge
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.200]   at your hotel and say, "Hey, I want to go check out the city.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   Should I do that?"
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.640]   The concierge would say, "Absolutely, you can go check out the city, but you want to
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:37.080]   stay away from this particular square at this particular time of day."
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.480]   Walk through at noon day around the federal government buildings where all the protests
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   are.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.480]   Absolutely, you're fine.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.640]   Walk through at 11 o'clock at night, not so good.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.480]   And so one of the most important things is always local knowledge.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.180]   Virtually everywhere in the world that you go, there will be some local knowledge.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.080]   Some local people will understand what's happening and when and where you can be in a certain
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.080]   place.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   And every type of crime differs.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:05.040]   A train station in Paris is going to be an extremely high crime area for petty crime,
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.760]   for pickpocketing.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:12.200]   But that's going to happen during midday, midday during the crowds.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:18.760]   And so you would be very well advised to carefully protect yourself, carefully protect your pockets,
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.800]   make sure that you engage in good anti-theft measures if you're going to be going through
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.200]   a train station in Paris at midday.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.120]   There's a different risk profile though to going through at midnight.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.700]   And so local intelligence is what you rely on when traveling.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.680]   And you rely on it in Portland, Oregon, in New York City, or in Mexico City, Mexico.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.620]   You just simply talk to the local people and find out what's going on.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.120]   Get the intelligence of what's happening in those local areas.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.400]   So let's expand our metaphor here for a moment.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.120]   Pardon the sniffing, I apologize.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.900]   But as I record this, I can't pause it at the moment.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.120]   Let's go back to our metaphor, back to our example.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   Let's say that you have a British tourist who's traveling to Chicago, staying at a normal
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.600]   hotel and talks to people and says, "Hey, is it safe for me to go and be in this certain
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.600]   neighborhood?
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.160]   Is it safe for me to go and be there?"
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.920]   And they go, "Yeah, everything's fine, everything's fine."
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:19.280]   But let's say that the British tourist now takes that information about safety and says,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.200]   "Okay, well I'm safe to go to this neighborhood and I'm safe to go out at this particular
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   time."
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.680]   But then they walk out of the hotel, they go to that neighborhood and they decide to
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.200]   buy some drugs.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.800]   Does their risk profile change?
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.200]   Answer is it changes dramatically.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.840]   The vast majority of people who are killed in Mexico or in many places are involved in
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.200]   gang activity.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.400]   Gang activity is often drug activity, often related to it.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.940]   You're going to be far less safe if you go to Cancun and you buy drugs and start doing
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:56.680]   drugs with your buddies than if you just simply go to Cancun and sit on the beach and drink
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.160]   alcohol from your hotel bar.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.120]   Your activities make a big, big difference in your safety.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.480]   It's not that Cancun itself is safe or unsafe, it's largely a matter of what your activities
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.480]   are.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.460]   And so if you're going to go and you're going to engage in illegal purchases, buying drugs,
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.720]   you're going to go and get involved in a gang, you're going to do something that's going
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.320]   to bring attention to you, advocate for some political cause or something like that, then
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.640]   your safety profile changes dramatically.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.560]   These are the factors that are the most important.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:36.200]   I do think that there are places in the world that are genuinely unsafe, that you genuinely
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:42.120]   need to need to plan with tremendous care and caution.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.720]   I think the handful of those places are the number of those places is extremely small.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.200]   I could probably only name a couple in today's world.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.440]   If I today, I'm not scared of going to Afghanistan.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.000]   I'm not scared of going to Iraq today.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I follow actually trip reports and whatnot of travelers who go do the visit those countries.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.280]   Places I am concerned about Venezuela, very concerned.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.560]   It's not impossible to travel safely in Venezuela, but it's very difficult right now.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.280]   Somalia, right?
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:23.440]   I'm concerned about Somalia and just because it's difficult in some of these places, you
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.480]   have to take many more precautions.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.400]   You have to be very thoughtful.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.840]   Sometimes you hire security.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.200]   Sometimes you make sure that you get the local guy who knows what's going on.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.440]   But the risk is far lower than a lot of people think.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.240]   Back to Mexico.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.520]   In my travels in Mexico, I've not really ever once thought about safety.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:53.280]   That's not to say that there may not be places in Mexico where I would not think about safety.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.240]   Here's how it sounds to me.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:00.600]   Imagine somebody coming to you and you live in Miami, Florida, and they're watching the
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.400]   people burning the city of Portland down.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.120]   And they're saying to you, don't you feel unsafe living in the United States?
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.200]   You say, bro, like that's Portland.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.360]   That's not Miami.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.720]   And that's these riots and protests.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.280]   That's not Miami, right?
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.500]   That's not the business district.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.920]   That's not the W Hotel in Miami.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   That's Portland.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   And that's totally different.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.680]   Well, at this point in time, I've come to see that that's basically the same about everywhere
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.200]   in the world.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   Mexico is not inherently unsafe.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   It's just simply not possible.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.680]   And you do this to the numbers.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.940]   It's just simply not.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.140]   Maybe they have a higher statistical crime rate.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.680]   But even that in and of itself doesn't make it inherently unsafe.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:51.080]   It's all a matter of where you're going, what are you doing, and can you pay attention to
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.160]   the advice that you get, pay attention to the activities that you engage in?
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:04.940]   So what I have learned in my lifetime is that most of these places are simply scary because
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.420]   you don't know them.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.680]   You don't have an idea of what they are.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.280]   I mean, do you understand, for example, Mexico, do you understand that Mexico City is what
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.760]   is it, something like the third or fourth largest city in the world?
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.480]   Tokyo, of course, is number one.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   Delhi is number two.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.040]   I have to recheck the data, but it's in the top 10, certainly.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:29.520]   Something like nine million people in the city proper, something like 20 million people,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.320]   I think, in the central area.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   That's a lot of people.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.600]   And it's a huge and kind of world-class city.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.880]   And so in the same way that you can be completely comfortable walking around downtown Manhattan,
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.280]   you can be completely comfortable walking around downtown Mexico City.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.800]   Bogota, another world-class city.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   I think what is it?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   I can't remember the number.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:21:00.040]   Something like six or nine million people in the central area.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:06.400]   You can't let your perceptions of what a place actually is like be formed without accurate
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.120]   information.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.880]   And so I used to worry about traveling to Mexico.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.880]   I don't worry about it.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.880]   I just don't see any indication.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.680]   With the things that I do and the places I go, I don't see any indications of safety.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   I do know that there are areas where I am going to pay attention.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.800]   So if I hear of an area that's experiencing a lot of cartel violence or something like
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.160]   that, I'm going to steer clear.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.360]   But I'm not going to steer clear of the entire country because of that.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.040]   My final comment, so my point there is simply this.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   Go check it out.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.800]   Go check it out.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.140]   And what will happen is as you check places out, you realize that your perceptions were
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.400]   very different than reality.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.160]   Go check it out.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.080]   The final comment I would make is this.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:56.920]   When you think about safety, recognize that you can always leave.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.560]   That is one of the tremendous privileges that you and I enjoy.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.360]   We can always leave.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   Back to the Haiti trip.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.560]   Remember, I told you my wife and I went to Hispaniola on our honeymoon.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.840]   And we went to the Dominican Republic, went to Haiti.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.000]   After a day and a half in Haiti, we were ready to leave.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.240]   I did not enjoy Haiti.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.600]   I had a terrible time there for a variety of reasons.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.920]   And we were planning to be there for almost a week.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.440]   But after a few days, I just looked at her and said, "We got to get out of here.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.960]   I do not want to be here anymore.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.280]   I'm not having fun.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.520]   I don't want to be here anymore.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.160]   I want to leave."
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   And we literally booked a ticket there.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:42.120]   We literally took a taxi to the airport in Port-au-Prince and tried to get out.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.200]   Now we were trying to get back to the Dominican Republic, so we were trying to fly back there.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.600]   But basically, I was showing up at the airport with a credit card and I was like, "Get me
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.920]   out of here."
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.160]   And I wasn't able to get out that day back to the Dominican Republic, but I got from
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.360]   Port-au-Prince and I bought a plane ticket on the spot to another place in Haiti, I think
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.120]   that was Cape Haitian.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.520]   And we flew to Cape Haitian and had a much better, had a wonderful time in Cape Haitian
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.960]   and then took the bus back the next day back to the Dominican Republic.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.200]   And so if you get to a place and you don't like it, you can always leave.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.680]   And you can apply this at the local level, right?
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.800]   If you're walking down the street, walking through a market and all of a sudden you get
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.040]   that tingly feeling in the back of your head, "I'm not in the right place."
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.600]   You stop, you call a taxi, you ask for help, you book an Uber, you do something, you call
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.400]   the hotel and say, "Come get me," and you just simply leave and you get out.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.920]   If you're in a country or a city and you don't like it and something's going wrong, then
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.360]   you leave and you get out.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:50.800]   But that's only been, for me, necessary really only one time and that is in Haiti.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   And I'm not scared to go back to Haiti, I just didn't have a nice time there, I didn't
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.680]   enjoy it at all.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.360]   And so I don't particularly want to go back to Haiti.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:06.600]   So that's how I would handle the question of safety is I would simply say, "Let's go
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.360]   check it out."
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:15.280]   And if you are a person with at least some means, is it more risky for someone?
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.920]   In some ways it's more risky for someone who's a penniless backpacker, taking a local chicken
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.880]   bus across the country.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.280]   But in some ways it's not because they're not necessarily a high profile.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.240]   But if you're kind of what I would call an average, normal, middle class person, get
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:36.320]   on an airplane and you fly, you call up Enrique and you fly to San Miguel de Allende and you
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.960]   book an Airbnb and you walk around, I mean, there's no crime.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.320]   I saw nothing to be concerned about in San Miguel de Allende.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:50.840]   If you go to resort town, it's just not unsafe.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.980]   It's not.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.520]   With those caveats that I said.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.520]   Here's something that I always think about, something that encourages me.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.840]   Years ago, I was talking to a friend of mine who is a reporter and we were talking about
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:08.000]   the news and I was bemoaning to him how the news was just so full of bad things, so full
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.120]   of violence, so full of problems, et cetera.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.880]   And he said to me this, said, Joshua, you should be thankful that the news is full of
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.880]   those things.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.600]   You should be thankful the news is full of kidnappings and rapes and violence and whatnot.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.680]   Because if it weren't full of those things, you would be in a worse situation than if
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.840]   the news were full of those things.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.120]   He said it's news by definition because it's abnormal.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.920]   Back to the classic kind of funny joke.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.160]   Dog bites man is not news.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.480]   Dog bite.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.720]   Man bites dog, that's news.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:46.880]   And so if the news is full of killings and rapings and kidnappings, et cetera, then recognize
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.920]   that's news because it's abnormal.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:56.400]   It's if that stuff is not in the news where you need to worry or you need to be concerned.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.200]   And so here's the basic problem with news information.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.360]   It is usually bad and it's sensationalistic, but it's sensationalistic and bad because
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.840]   it's abnormal.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:12.560]   And the fact that it's abnormal indicates that it's not something that should be statistically
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.040]   expected to happen to you.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:21.140]   I'm not, even though I watch the news from Portland, Oregon, right, but I'm not unsafe
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.120]   going to Portland, Oregon.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.320]   As long as I avoid certain times and certain situations.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.440]   It's just that's the news because that's different and unique.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.960]   And this is what makes it so hard in the modern world because we're exposed and subjected
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.800]   to so much news that is genuinely important.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.840]   It is genuinely newsworthy, but it's not going to affect your life.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.240]   So there's a bombing at some hotel.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.440]   Well, it's probably not going to affect your life to go to that place.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.200]   And so the news is valuable to know.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.360]   It indicates something.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.520]   You pay attention to it.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.480]   You talk to local people and find out about it.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.800]   So there's my conversation on safety.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.040]   I would just say that what I've done is say, what's the worst that could happen?
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.680]   And let me just avoid that and go and check it out and trust your gut.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.640]   But I don't think that I am quite confident that I can travel to Mexico.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.920]   I'm quite confident that I can live in Mexico and be totally safe.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.480]   I'm just going to be smart about it.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.400]   And if the situation changes, then I'm going to be ready to change myself.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.440]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.120]   I hope that helps you.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.600]   The more time I spend traveling to different places,
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.960]   the more accurate understanding I have of how the world works
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.280]   and the more confidence I have in what's right for me and my family.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.480]   And I wish that same feeling for you and yours.
