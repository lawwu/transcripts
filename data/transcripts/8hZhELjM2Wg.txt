[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The average savings that we tell patients they can expect, whether it's a complex dental procedure
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.120]   or an orthopedic procedure like a new knee or a new hip, which is very common, or IVF,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.560]   is anywhere from 40 to 65 percent. So if you want to just figure roughly half, that's a good number.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.960]   People who've been goaded by advertising or social media where they're advertising some cost
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.840]   that is 80, 85 percent savings, 90 percent savings, you really want to watch out for that. Cost
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.080]   shopping is one of the biggest mistakes that a medical traveler can make. Those are the people
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.280]   that get into trouble, because the clinic's got to make money too. So they can't offer a knee
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.240]   procedure for $800. They got to pay their rent. They got to keep their equipment up. They got to
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.560]   feed their families. So if you aren't within that 50 to 70 percent, 40 to 60 percent cost range,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.080]   you want to look out. If it's not enough of a savings by the time you add your travel,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.080]   your accommodations, your dining, and all that, unless you're tacking it on
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.120]   to your procedure, then you're probably not saving enough.
