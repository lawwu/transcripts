[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   A podcast listener named Joe writes in to ask a perplexing question faced by all of
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.160]   us, "Should I pray to Jesus or to the Spirit or to the Father?"
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.800]   It is remarkable, Tony, how many people over the years have asked me this question.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.840]   It's just one of the most common, and it's a good one.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.560]   And I think I understand why it comes up so much, because we have traditions that most
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.600]   of us grew up in, and we wonder, "Well, is that tradition the only permissible way?"
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.400]   For example, most of us—it's true for me and my family—most of us in the evangelical
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.880]   family probably grew up beginning our prayers with "Heavenly Father" or "Our Father" or
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.840]   "Dear Father," and ending them with "In Jesus' name, amen."
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.760]   That's a liturgy that we've just learned.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.120]   Pray to the Father, close in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.600]   And frankly, I'm going to argue that's a great tradition.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.800]   I think children should grow up with that form as the main form of their prayer.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.120]   Pray to God the Father in the power of God the Spirit, in the name or by the authority
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.440]   and the merit of God the Son.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.040]   That's the Trinitarian structure mainly of prayer in the Bible.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.200]   And so it's not surprising that it's profoundly rooted in Scripture.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.400]   So Hebrews 4, "Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.560]   Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.560]   For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.680]   who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.040]   Therefore," crucial word, "Therefore, let us with confidence draw near to the throne
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.440]   of grace."
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.720]   We only can come to God in prayer pleading for grace because we have a high priest, which
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.040]   is why we pray in Jesus' name.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.040]   I would never let my kids, at least I tried not to, use "In Jesus' name, amen" as a throwaway
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.920]   phrase at the end of prayer.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.360]   I told them, "Don't slur that.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.680]   Don't rush that."
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.760]   These words express something glorious and essential.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.520]   We have no access to God without Christ and His name.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.360]   And so when we pray, "In Jesus' name," we're saying that to the Father.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.000]   I'm coming not in my own name, not in my own merit, not in my own worth.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I'm coming because Christ loved me, Christ died for me, Christ rose for me, Christ intercedes
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   for me.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.080]   That's what that little name, that little phrase carries, and it's just huge.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.720]   And Paul draws in the third member of the Trinity, right?
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   In Ephesians 6, 18, "Praying at all times in the Spirit," or Jude 1, 20, "You, beloved,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit," which I think
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.680]   means realize that your heart would never have an inclination to pray to God for true
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.400]   blessing apart from the humbling, transforming, faith-giving work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.600]   So confess this, say this to the Lord and to yourself.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.280]   I rely upon the Holy Spirit when I pray in Jesus' name to the Father.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.020]   And of course, Jesus put it totally plainly in John 15, 16, "Whatever you ask the Father
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.840]   in my name, He will give it to you."
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.400]   Now having said, "Amen, amen," that's the basic right, good tradition, I want to also
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:14.360]   say it is good and it is healthy to speak to Jesus as your friend and Savior and Lord
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.240]   and God and to the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.600]   Even though some manuscripts are different here, the best one, most of the modern translations
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:33.360]   translate John 14, 14 like this, "Jesus said, 'If you ask me anything in my name, I will
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   do it.'"
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.720]   And Revelation 22, 20, we're speaking to Jesus when we say, "He who testifies to these things
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.880]   says, 'Surely I am coming soon,'" and we respond, "Amen, come, Lord Jesus."
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.040]   Or 1 Corinthians 16, 22, "If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed," and
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.320]   then we talk to the Lord, "Oh Lord, come."
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.560]   And frankly, Tony, my own soul says, "If I grieve the Holy Spirit," which it says I do
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:14.120]   in Ephesians 4, 30, "If I grieve the Holy Spirit, I think I should say, 'I'm sorry,'"
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   to the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.240]   I mean, it's just strange if he's a person and I have grieved him, that I would just
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.720]   ignore talking to him and go to the Father and say, "I'm sorry I grieved your spirit."
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.200]   Well, that's okay, but there is something profound in the Trinitarian reality of the
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.380]   personhood of the Son and the Spirit that we would treat them as persons.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.680]   So my conclusion is, let your normal, regular praying be prayer to the Father through the
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:51.080]   Spirit in the name of Jesus, but realize that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are persons, and
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.200]   to speak to them as a saved sinner would cannot be unnatural.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.880]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Joe.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.160]   We recently talked about prayer in another episode, episode number 413, titled "When
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.760]   Should I Stop Praying for Something?"
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.440]   Be sure to check that out.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.920]   Well, it's Friday and we have a long weekend ahead of us here in the States, thanks to
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.360]   Labor Day, but the Ask Pastor John podcast does not take a break.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.160]   No, we will be back on Monday.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.700]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.760]   Have a wonderful extended weekend.
