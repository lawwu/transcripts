[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   So somebody comes in. They're very humble. Yes. Well, is it? Do you immediately? I'm suspicious.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.680]   Why? I figure most people who are going to make something of themselves are arrogant.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.360]   If they're willing to show it, there's a certain bravery or openness in that.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.320]   I don't rule out the humble person doing great. A lot of people who do great are humble,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.440]   but I just get a wee bit like, what's up with you? You're not really humble. Are you?
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.000]   Oh, so like maybe the humility is a way of like avoiding confrontation. Like you don't have the
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.120]   confidence to actually show that you can be great. So you're just right now. It might be efficient
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.680]   for them to avoid confrontation. Right. But I would just say I start thinking I don't know the
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.920]   real story. When I see a bit of arrogance, I'm less likely to think like it may in a way be feigned.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.600]   But the feigning of arrogance is itself a kind of arrogance. And in that sense,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.960]   I'm still getting the genuine thing.
