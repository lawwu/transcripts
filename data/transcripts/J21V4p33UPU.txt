[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   Well, we are living in the end times. We are living in the final chapter of redemptive
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.280]   history according to scripture because Christ was the first fruit from the dead. See 1 Corinthians
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.120]   chapter 15. The new creation has now broken into the old creation. And to talk about this
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.920]   theme in this episode, we have a question today about a theologian named George Eldon
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.040]   Ladd, who was born in 1911 and died in 1982 at the age of 71. The question comes to us
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.160]   from a listener named Matthew. Dear Pastor John, I've been reading a lot of books recently
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.360]   by a professor from Fuller Seminary I'm sure you're familiar with, Dr. George Eldon Ladd.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.560]   I'm intrigued by his writings, but I don't know what to make of his theological leanings,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.000]   whether or not he is an evangelical. What is your opinion on Ladd? Did you ever have
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.920]   him as a professor, and how did he shape your theology today?
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.800]   Well I totally did not expect a question like this, and I'm so happy to have it. Because
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.560]   I don't hesitate, Matthew, to say that I'm thrilled that you are reading George Ladd.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.240]   I really am. I knew George Ladd personally as my professor in the days when I was at
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.480]   Fuller Seminary from '68 to '71. That's a previous century. That's 1968 to '71. I took
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.680]   his basic course on New Testament theology, which became that book New Testament Theology,
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.600]   and was in his home for discussion at least once. He was, as many evangelicals were back
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.240]   in those days, a kind of broken man with many personal flaws, but I had an affection for
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.400]   him, still do, because of what he taught me. I totally regard him as an evangelical. In
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.840]   fact, I would say he was a conservative evangelical, and one who would affirm all the so-called
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.000]   fundamentals of the faith, even though he himself would not want to be called a fundamentalist.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.080]   He was what was being called in those days neo-evangelicals, who were trying to distance
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.160]   themselves from fundamentalism in the sense of engaging with frontline Christian scholarship
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:32.040]   and cultural involvement. What I mean when I call him an evangelical, just to put clear
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.480]   meat on the bones, is, number one, he believed in the inerrancy of the Bible, he believed
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.280]   in the substitutionary work of Christ on the cross, where God actually propitiated His
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.120]   own wrath against sinners so that we could be justified by faith alone. He believed in
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.600]   the necessity of hearing the gospel in order to be saved, and that people must be born
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.360]   again in order to escape hell, which was real and conscious eternal torment. He believed
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.960]   in the necessity of good works as a demonstration of faith, and the necessity of preaching the
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.280]   gospel to all the nations so that they'd have a chance to believe and be saved. I know
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.320]   personally he believed all of those things. So let me just mention a few other things
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.400]   about him so that you can get your bearings as you read and know what you're in for,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.320]   or what the wider perspective is on some of the things you're seeing, maybe. Ladd's
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.880]   book, which bears the present title "The Presence of the Future," used to be called
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.480]   "Jesus and the Kingdom." When it first came out and I read it, it was called "Jesus
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.440]   and the Kingdom." That book, in answer to your question, "What Kind of Influence?"
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:55.000]   was a path-breaking book to describe the pervasive nature of eschatology in the New Testament.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.080]   What I mean by that is that eschatology is not simply what happens in the future at the
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.960]   end of the age, but since Christ, the Messiah expected for the end of the age, has come
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.680]   and has broken into the present age, brought the kingdom of God to the present, he brought
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:29.720]   the future into the present so that all of life is eschatological. The future is here,
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:39.000]   because the present participates in the already of the kingdom, but the not yet of the consummation.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.480]   That's the paradigm that has shaped virtually everybody in biblical studies in the last
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.360]   50 years. He wasn't the only one who spoke it, but I think he was one of the decisive
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.880]   voices for creating that kind of mindset that is virtually in every seminary in the country.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.240]   Everybody talks in terms of the already of the kingdom and the not yet of the kingdom,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.000]   which is absolutely right to talk about.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.360]   Here's a second thing. Ladd wrote a very important book called The New Testament and Criticism,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.160]   in which he tried to show how an evangelical can make a judicious use of contemporary critical
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:29.520]   methods of Bible study without undermining the doctrine of inerrancy. Third, Ladd was
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:38.360]   perhaps best known among conservatives because of his strong affirmation of premillennial
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:47.420]   eschatology and post-tribulational return of Christ. In other words, he did not believe
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:57.240]   that the church would be raptured out of the world, followed then by a period of tribulation,
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:05.080]   followed by the second coming. Rather, he believed that the next major event on God's
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.800]   eschatological calendar, after the revealing of the man of sin and 2 Thessalonians 2 and
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.560]   a great period of tribulation, that the next big thing is the second coming, when Jesus
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.480]   would establish his earthly millennial kingdom for a thousand years, after which Satan would
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.680]   be released, there would be a great final battle, and then the inauguration of the final
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.840]   state of the new heavens and the new earth. This is now called—has been called, anyway,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.400]   for years—historic premillennialism. And I found the arguments compelling in those
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   days, and as I've tried to continue to weigh them, I still find them compelling, so I'd
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:52.040]   be happy to be a Ladd-like premillennialist today. I could wish—one more thing—I could
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.280]   wish that every believer today—we're talking, what, how many years since he passed away?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.840]   Fifty-plus years, maybe? I can't remember when he passed away. I could wish that every
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:12.680]   believer would read his New Testament theology. Oh, what a wonderful education would lie in
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.000]   store for the person willing to put in the effort. And it's not too demanding. If you
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.840]   can read Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology, you can read Ladd's New Testament theology.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   It does not presume Greek and Hebrew. So I think Ladd's New Testament theology is accessible,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   and I congratulate you on discovering this man who flourished in the middle of the 20th
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.640]   century, and I think the Church needs his teaching today.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.680]   Well, that is high applause. Wow. Thank you, Pastor John, for going back into your history
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.160]   and sharing that with us, and thank you for listening and making the podcast a part of

[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.520]   We are going to return on Friday, and I think, if I remember correctly, it's a Bible reading
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.680]   question from a very busy man with a job and a wife and kids who has such a limited time
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.080]   in the Word each day. He wants to know if there are any shortcuts to Bible reading and
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.160]   how deep you must go each day to benefit from reading. It's a really good question for busy
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.840]   dads. It's a really good question for busy moms. It's a really good question for busy
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.680]   students. Anybody who feels the time crunch on their Bible reading, it's going to be,
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:47.360]   I believe, an important discussion. That is on Friday, I think. It's coming up. At some
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.000]   point that question is coming up. I think it's on Friday. Until then, I'm your host,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.840]   Tony Reiki. Whatever's on Friday, I'll see you then.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.340]   [END]
