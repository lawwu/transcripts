[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.240]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33, verses
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.560]   26 and 33, in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.560]   John answered them saying, "I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.040]   ye know not, and I knew him not.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.000]   But he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, 'Upon whom thou shalt
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.880]   see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880]   Holy Ghost.'"
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.200]   And I would like to read in connection with that the words that are to be found at the
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.880]   end of the 18th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, with reference to a
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.800]   man called Apollos.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.400]   And when he was dispersed to pass into a care, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.560]   to receive him, who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.020]   For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.020]   was Christ.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.560]   Now, though this is a day that is observed in most parts of the Church as a day of remembrance,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.500]   it is no reason why we should depart from what we have been considering together here
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.800]   on a number of Sunday mornings.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.780]   I want to show you the relevance of what we are considering to everything, to a day like
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.400]   this perhaps in particular.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.960]   Nothing is more fatal in the Christian life than to live in compartments, and to think
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.900]   that your Christianity or faith is one thing which you keep in one compartment, but your
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.720]   life in the world is something quite different, and that there is no connection at all between
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720]   the two.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.060]   That has been the curse, probably the greatest of all curses, in connection with the life
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.700]   of the Christian Church, that our religion becomes something formal, which we do only
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.020]   on certain special occasions, almost like putting on a suit of clothing.
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.700]   Now, I say that everything in the Bible and all its teaching is designed to make of us
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.780]   such people that we shall have an impact wherever we happen to be, whatever we may happen to
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.900]   do, whatever our calling or profession or vocation may chance to be.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.580]   Now then, what we are really considering is this, and to me this is the most urgent matter
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.020]   in the whole world.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.760]   What is a Christian?
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.860]   And I am suggesting that the answer is that a Christian is one who is described in the
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.940]   sixteenth verse of this first chapter of John's Gospel, where John says, "And of his fulness
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.400]   of all we received, and grace upon grace."
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.300]   And this is the great question.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.580]   Are we such people?
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.020]   Are we men and women who have received of the fulness of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.500]   Now, I have been saying that there are two main reasons why we should consider that question
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   urgently.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.780]   The first is a purely personal one, that we are meant to enjoy these benefits, that the
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.780]   Christian is meant to be a rejoicing person.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.300]   He is not meant to rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.300]   He is meant to be more than conqueror in this world.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.060]   Whoever may come to meet him will be set against him.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.900]   "Yea," he says, "the Scriptures say, 'In all these things we are more than conquerors
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.100]   through him that loved us.'"
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.140]   Now, the great question for us all is, are we in that position?
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.940]   Are we enjoying the happiness?
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.380]   Are we experiencing the joy of the Lord that we were meant to have with such richness,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.100]   such fullness?
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.220]   So it is important, you see, from our own personal standpoint.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.860]   What is more tragic than that a man should be living as a pauper though he has inherited
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.860]   a fortune?
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.940]   Well, that is the position of so many Christian people, and it is a very tragic state to be
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.940]   in.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.060]   And the way to deal with it is to study the Scriptures as we are trying to do.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.220]   But, and today I am much more concerned about the second reason for considering all this,
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.820]   and that is the general one.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:40.220]   What I mean by the general one is this, is our influence in the world.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.580]   A Christian, according to the teaching of the Bible, is one who is meant to be a witness
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.580]   in the world.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.460]   You remember our Lord, just before his ascension, gathered these disciples together and he spoke
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.500]   to them and he said, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and Samaria and
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.020]   the outermost parts of the world."
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.500]   And that is one of the best descriptions of the Christian.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.380]   He is a witness, he is a confessor, he is a man who bears the message of his Lord in
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:18.580]   society and in the world, and shows the world the way of salvation.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:26.900]   Now that is exactly where all this, you see, that we are considering becomes so relevant.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.740]   According to the teaching of the Scripture, we cannot be adequate and true witnesses unless
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.500]   we receive power from on high.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   That is what, you see, our Lord told these men just before the ascension, "But ye shall
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:51.660]   receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.100]   me both in Jerusalem, etc."
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.820]   Now you see the connection of these things.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.340]   No man can be a witness to this truth about the fullness of Jesus Christ and all that
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.720]   it leads to.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.740]   No man can be a true witness to that unless he receives the power of the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.180]   There is a plain statement.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.940]   Here our Lord is addressing men who had been with him for three years, his own innermost
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.100]   circle, these disciples.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.360]   They had heard all his sermons and addresses, they had seen his miracles, they had seen
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.580]   him dying upon a cross, they had seen him taken down and buried, they had seen a stone
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.700]   rolled over that grave and sealed and guarded by soldiers, but they knew that he had risen,
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.980]   that he had come bodily out of that grave, and he had manifested himself to them for
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.740]   forty days, and they were on the verge of seeing him ascending into heaven.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.140]   Now, you would have thought that no men were in a better position to be witnesses than
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.140]   these men.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:55.860]   They had got first-hand information, first-hand instruction, they had seen these things with
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.540]   their own eyes.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:04.900]   And yet you notice our Lord says to them of all men, "Tarry ye in Jerusalem, wait until
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.980]   you receive this power which I am going to send upon you."
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.000]   Not many days hence, he says, he shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, and the teaching
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.260]   is so plainly, therefore, that without this baptism of the Spirit, this baptism with power,
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:30.260]   no one can witness truly, neither a preacher in a pulpit, nor an individual living life
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.680]   day by day, or talking to men and women about the world and its state and condition and
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.860]   all its affairs.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.300]   Very well, then, you see the relevance of all this.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.560]   You and I are all citizens of this world, of Great Britain, as well as being citizens
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.560]   of the kingdom of God and of heaven.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.840]   And we are part and parcel of the affairs of this world, and we live next door to people
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.640]   and amongst them and work with them and so on, and these people are concerned about and
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.280]   talk about the state and the condition of affairs, both in this nation and internationally.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.480]   And it is an age of bewilderment, it is an age of uncertainty, it is an age of fear.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:22.860]   Here we are this morning, bearing in mind two world wars, and young men who were cut
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.400]   off in their prime.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.560]   This is the tragedy of men and the tragedy of the world, the tragedy of life.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.660]   And we see all that is happening in the modern world.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.200]   Is there to be another war?
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   Who knows?
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.640]   Everything is so uncertain, and mankind is bewildered.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.440]   It shows its bewilderment in many different ways.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.400]   The commonest way of showing it at the present time is just to indulge in a riot of pleasure.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.520]   That is nothing but a sign of a terrible spirit of fear and of bewilderment.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.160]   It is pure escapism.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.560]   And the world today is escaping, it is dragging itself in various shapes and forms because
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.040]   it dare not sit down and face reality.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.340]   It is too staggering, it is too alarming.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:13.920]   The Bible says that you and I are lights in that sort of world.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.520]   There is no light in the world apart from us.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.880]   There is no knowledge, there is no understanding.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.800]   It is the Christian view alone that is able to understand the world even as it is this
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   morning.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   Very well.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.960]   Here then comes our great opportunity.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.440]   Never has the opportunity to the Christian been greater than it is today.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   Many fail to see that.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.100]   They fail to see that because of the statistics.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.620]   They say, "But look at the position."
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:50.140]   Yes, I reply, "Yes, on the other hand, the opportunity is greater because of the state
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.140]   of affairs."
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.660]   Now take that last hymn we sang.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.100]   These hymns are interesting.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.820]   Let us never forget that the hymns are not divinely inspired, as the scriptures are.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:05.540]   You notice that last verse we sang and how, of course, it dates and shows the date at
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.100]   which it was written.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.540]   The last verse went somewhat like this.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:18.180]   It says, "All heathen lands afar, thick darkness broodeth yet."
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.100]   You notice that the writer of the hymn died in 1905.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.040]   He was born in 1824.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.020]   How typical of the Victorian outlook.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.020]   Great Britain, you see, was all right.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.060]   "But all heathen lands afar, thick darkness broodeth yet.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.980]   We've got to send this light which we've already got to those heathen lands afar."
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.260]   Great Britain was not a heathen land, you see.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.180]   Would he write that verse today, I wonder.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.480]   I don't think so.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.860]   We are a heathen land.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.360]   All the lands are heathen.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.900]   These two world wars have shattered that kind of false optimism that was so prevalent towards
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.580]   the end of the last century and in the early years of the present century.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:08.300]   Indeed, this fatal optimism persisted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914,
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.460]   and then it suddenly was shattered, and it's been shattered ever since.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:19.740]   But there, I say, comes this amazing opportunity for the Christian, who shouldn't be bewildered
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.100]   by all this, but should understand it.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.100]   Very well.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.620]   Now then, I'm putting all these things together, you see.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:31.940]   We are to be witnesses in a world like that, and we can't be witnesses, we are told, without
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.140]   the power that the Holy Spirit alone can give us.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.140]   Very well.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.860]   Let's try and look at this then, this morning, in this more general way.
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.340]   The charge that's brought against us evangelicals is that we're only concerned about ourselves,
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.700]   our own inward moods and states and conditions, and that we forget the world.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.900]   We don't.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:56.180]   We don't, but we do say this, that you can only influence the world by being like yourself.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.180]   That's the big difference.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.580]   Well, very well, let me put it like this then.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.300]   It's obvious, I think, we'll all agree, that the Church has very little influence at the
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.620]   present time.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.180]   She counts for practically nothing.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.980]   Her voice goes unheeded.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:16.180]   The world is almost amused at the pronouncement of ecclesiastical leaders.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.980]   It says and thinks, I suppose, that they're paid to do this sort of thing, but nobody
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.380]   pays any attention to them.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.460]   And the governments pay no attention to them, because they know that the votes of the Christians
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.460]   don't count.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.460]   We are so small in number.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.500]   We are but a remnant in this land.
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:39.180]   And the result is that the Church has so little influence upon the world as it is in this
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.860]   tremendous crisis through which it's passing.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:49.020]   Now, to me, the really significant thing about all that is just this.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:55.020]   Heather, perhaps, as the Church, talked more about worldly affairs than she's done in this
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.460]   present century.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:03.460]   This is a most important point, as I see things in the diagnosis of the situation by which
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.460]   we are confronted.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:10.780]   Towards the end of the last century, and much more so in this present century, a great reaction
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.900]   came in against evangelical preaching.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.940]   And what was put up instead of it was the so-called social gospel.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.700]   We were told we mustn't talk about miracles and personal conversion and regeneration and
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:29.300]   things like that, that the business of the Church was to bring in the Kingdom of God.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.620]   And the way to do that was to cooperate with the politicians, and by acts of Parliament
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.260]   you could legislate in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:41.020]   The Sermon on the Mount was said to be the great social charter of the human race.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.740]   And it must be all practical, not pie in the sky, but putting the present world right.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:53.420]   Now, the great emphasis was changed from an evangelical doctrine to this social doctrine,
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.420]   this social gospel.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:01.260]   And the Church has been preaching this most assiduously during this present century.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.780]   It said, "You know, that old teaching, it didn't affect society.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.420]   It was all right for the individual, but it had no effect upon society.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:14.180]   But if we preach this direct, ethical, moral, practical message, well then, we will influence
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.820]   the whole of society."
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:22.660]   Now, what is so interesting is this, you see, that it is since the Church changed her emphasis
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:29.340]   in that way that she has been counting less and less in the life of society.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.620]   As I say, she's never counted less than today.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.960]   The argument was, if only we took an interest in practical affairs, the whole world would
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   listen to us.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.380]   They're not interested in this personal, selfish business, but they're very interested
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380]   in public affairs.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.140]   Well, the Church has been doing that very thing.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:51.980]   And the more she's done that, the less she has affected the surroundings and circumstances,
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:58.460]   the less she counts, the less influence she has upon the general state of this country
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.980]   and upon affairs in general.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.260]   Now, this is, to me, the whole key to the situation.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   That, you see, was a fatal and a tragic blunder, a complete misunderstanding of the teaching
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.180]   of the Bible itself.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.220]   It was done in the interests of dealing with affairs.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.860]   Its result has been less influence than ever upon affairs.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.900]   Very well, there is our starting point.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:31.180]   So that that, you see, raises immediately this question, "What is the Church meant
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.180]   to do?
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.180]   What is the Church meant to be?"
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:39.940]   Now, we are looking at ourselves as a company now, not so much the individual aspect this
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.940]   morning.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.940]   It's the business and the function of the Church.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:49.860]   It's a question that is most relevant on a day like this, this day of remembrance.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.540]   So let me suggest some of the things that the Church is not meant to be.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:16:00.460]   And the first is the Church is not meant to be some sort of court chaplain.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.940]   That is how she is regarded by large numbers of people, probably the majority of people
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.180]   in this country today.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.420]   What's the Church?
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:14.660]   Well, the Church is a very useful institution when you've got some great ceremonial occasion.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:21.300]   You always need this extra note, the religious note that adds a solemnity and a dignity and
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.380]   even a formality to the formal occasion.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.220]   And the Church is past master at this.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:35.500]   She can provide the dignity and the processions and the cloaks and the robes, and she therefore
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.940]   adds something to some civic or national occasion.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.860]   She comes in like that, of course, not interested in what she is during the rest of the year,
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.700]   but on certain special days and occasions, well, yes, the Church is very useful, you
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   call her in.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.700]   She's a court chaplain.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:17:00.620]   A chaplain doesn't deal much with affairs, but now and again the chaplain is quite useful.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.580]   As individuals do that, it isn't only the state that does this, the individuals do it.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.420]   There are many people in this country who forget the existence of the Church until a
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.780]   marriage comes along.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.460]   Ah, the Church.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:18.980]   Nobody can quite take a marriage service like the Church, or a christening, or a funeral.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.740]   Of course, in general, the Church is no use at all, but when you have these very special
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.020]   - well, then the Church really does do these things better than anybody else.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.980]   It's the sort of speciality of the Christian Church.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.780]   Court chaplain.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.360]   And in this same category goes the whole idea that the business of the Church is just to
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.620]   give some vague, very general comfort.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.820]   They don't know what the comfort is, but somehow or another the Church does help to
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:54.060]   provide a comfort, dim religious light, as the poet calls it, atmosphere, certain type
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:18:03.420]   of music, certain great passages of scripture, wonderful first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.780]   chapter 15, incomparable literature, if well read, something moving.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.460]   They don't know the particular message, they don't know, they've never considered it,
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:18.380]   but somehow or other the sound of it gives you a sense of comfort and makes you feel
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:25.300]   a little bit less cast down, it assuages your grief, and so the Church is incomparable in
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.160]   this matter of giving us some general comfort.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.580]   And on a day like this, when you think of so many thousands, millions slaughtered in
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:41.380]   the madness of war, somehow or another, well, our God, our helping age has passed and abide
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:50.300]   with me, they give you a nice sort of feeling and give you a vague, general sense of comfort.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:55.420]   Isn't that the view many take of the function of the Church?
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.540]   And then there are others who think the main business of the Church, perhaps, is to enforce
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:05.580]   the appeals of the state for patriotism in times of war.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:12.100]   There was no question about that in the First World War, the Church often became nothing
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:18.300]   but a kind of recruiting station, and I don't think she's recovered from that ever since.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.300]   There were men who had always gone to church, until then they became antagonistic.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.460]   They say the Church turned herself into a kind of recruiting station, and the preachers
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.940]   became recruiting sergeants.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.580]   And there are many who never came back to the Church after the end of that war.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.780]   The men whose lives were spared, they never came back.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.340]   They felt that the Church, after all, was nothing but some sort of secular institution,
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.140]   and that she'd become, thus, the tool of the state.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.460]   Or, short of that, there are many who think the business of the Church is to make an appeal
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.340]   for discipline and morality.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:57.020]   After all, the state is the problem of moral delinquency and all these other things, and
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.900]   the magistrates haven't got time to deal with all the cases of various descriptions.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:07.700]   Well, now can't the Church help here by reinforcing this appeal for discipline and for morality
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.700]   and so on?
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.300]   Now these are some of the conceptions that people have of the Church, and you can see
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.740]   it all in certain big examples in history.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.500]   You think, for instance, of the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, how she dominated
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.020]   the life of the world, manipulated kings and emperors and princes.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:30.020]   She really was a great secular power, and everything else was subservient to her.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.860]   Or think, for instance, of the Russian Orthodox Church.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.020]   You see, people talk about the problem of communism, but the question we ought to ask
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.620]   is how did it ever come into being?
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.680]   And I have no hesitation in asserting that probably one of the main factors in the producing
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.860]   of communism as the controlling power in Russia was the Russian Orthodox Church, controlling
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:00.140]   the emperor, perhaps particularly the empress of Russia at that time, and all that that
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.140]   represents.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.140]   And the people said, "If this is Christianity, we don't want it."
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.340]   So they turned to a godless atheism.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.300]   It's not difficult to understand.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.700]   They were revolting against something that is an utter travesty of the Christian Church.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:20.140]   Or, let's be quite honest and come a little bit nearer home, I feel that the Church in
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.460]   this country today is still suffering the results of a similar error.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.380]   You know how common it was said at the end of the Victorian era, during the Edwardian
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:40.900]   era, that the Tory party was nothing but the Church of England, that the Church of England
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.100]   was nothing but the Tory party at prayer, and that the non-conformist chapels were the
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.460]   Liberal party at prayer, and there was a great measure of truth in it.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:58.820]   The same division, Tory-Liberal, Church of England, non-conformist, free Church.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.300]   And you see, there was this alignment, and that was the view people took.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.380]   Well now then, what are we to say about all this?
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.140]   Well, what's so obvious is, I think, the need of clear thinking.
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:15.260]   We are in an age of revolution, my friends, a great age of transition and of revolution.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.940]   And I'm one of those who believes the Christian Church has got an opportunity such as she
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.820]   hadn't had for many centuries, if she can but see it.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:29.340]   Therefore, it is essential we should have some clear thinking.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.420]   What is the cause of all that I've been describing?
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:41.300]   Well, it all began way back when that Emperor Constantine of Rome decided he'd become a
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:47.500]   Christian and bring the Roman Empire into Christianity.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:55.780]   That was the turning point, it seems to me, the point at which this whole tendency came
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:01.280]   in which has put the Church so often onto the wrong lines.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.980]   And ever since then, you have had this confusion.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.660]   You see, he came in, and with his great power, he became the ruler, as it were, of the Church,
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.300]   and he began calling councils and so on, he tried to dictate policies.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.700]   Thank God, there were always individuals like the great Athanasius who didn't hesitate
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.900]   to stand up to him and to refuse to bow the knee to him, and there were others.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.820]   All this was happening about the year 425 A.D.
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.700]   But since then, there have been three main views about the function of the Church.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.140]   The Roman Catholic view is that the state is subservient to the Church.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.560]   That's, as I told you, what happened in the Middle Ages.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:45.780]   The Pope was really supreme over all, and emperors and kings had to go to Rome and listen
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.860]   to him, and he laid down his dictates, and he said what should be done.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.380]   He was the supreme political authority.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.860]   Rome always claims that.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:59.900]   She claims supremacy in the political realm as much as in the religious realm, and that
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.660]   is why you not only get ambassadors sent to the Vatican today, but you get kings and others
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:09.700]   and queens going there and bowing to the Pope and acting as penitents.
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:14.900]   It's a great state, and the Church is over the state.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.700]   The Church is supreme and controls even the secular state.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.540]   Indeed, to them, nothing is secular because everything is under the state.
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.540]   Now, that's one view.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:32.300]   Well, then there's the exact opposite of that, which is called the Erastian view, first
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:38.780]   introduced by a man called Erastus in the sixteenth century, and that teaches this,
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:44.740]   that the Church is more or less a branch of the state, that the Church is subservient
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.740]   to the state.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:53.480]   That was what was adopted in this country under the Elizabethan order, Elizabeth I.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   The state is supreme.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:01.580]   The king, queen, is the head of the Church, and the Church is nothing but one of the functions
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.940]   of the state.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.940]   That's Erastianism.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:10.300]   Martin Luther rarely, virtually did the same thing in Germany, not as openly and as blatantly
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:16.540]   perhaps, but in essence, the Lutheran position is very much the same, and ultimately it helps
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.480]   to account even for a man like Hitler.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.500]   That nation was ready for that sort of thing.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.400]   So you've got that Erastian or semi-Lutheran view.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:36.140]   And then over against all this was the view which is called the Reformed view, the view
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:42.820]   propagated and taught so plainly and clearly, first of all, by John Calvin, the four-hundredth
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.580]   anniversary of whose death is being celebrated this year.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.500]   He said, "No, both these views are wrong, and both those views are shown to be wrong
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.500]   by the Scripture."
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.500]   Well, what's the right view?
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:26:02.600]   Well, he said the right view is this, that the state and the Church are complementary,
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:09.540]   that they are both ordained of God, that they are both something that God has brought into
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:15.540]   being—that it is God who has ordained the state, it is God who has ordained the Church.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:22.600]   Their functions are different, they are essentially different, yet they are complementary.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.680]   It isn't that the Church is over the state, or the state over the Church, but these are
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.240]   two bodies that are complementary.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.660]   They both derive their authority from God, and they mustn't interfere with one another's
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.660]   activities.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.860]   There are points when they can cooperate, but they mustn't interfere.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:45.700]   The state has no power over the Church, and the Church has no power over the state.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:51.200]   They are distinct and separate, but they are coordinate, they are complementary.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:58.580]   God has ordered both these estates, and that is the true and the right way to look at them.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:03.140]   Well, now then, I am suggesting that this is what we need is to recapture this, and
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:09.900]   then, having seen what the Church and state are essentially, and what the Church is in
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.480]   particular, we come to this point.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.740]   What is the primary business, therefore, of the Church?
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.820]   I have rejected the notion that she is just a function of the state, or the state chaplain,
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.540]   or a department of government, as it were, that is called in by the government at certain
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:33.980]   points, one of the multiplicity of ministries that has its function and its use at certain
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.980]   points.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.660]   That is to be totally rejected.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.100]   What then is the primary business of the Church?
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.940]   Well, the answer of the New Testament is patent.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:48.460]   It is to produce Christian people, Christian individuals.
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:54.660]   This is the primary task of the Church, to make men and women Christian.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.940]   Now, let us put that over against something else.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:05.880]   The primary business of the Church is not just to give general advice to the state.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.340]   The first primary business of the Church is not merely to be protesting forever against
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.340]   things that are done by the state.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.160]   You realize this is what is happening.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.500]   If you took your notion of Christianity from the television, this is exactly the impression
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.840]   you would get, that the Church is always to be talking about these secular matters.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:30.740]   It will be done today, I have no doubt, with very great frequency indeed.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:36.340]   Statements will be made about problems in this country and about problems in South Africa,
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.340]   the usual.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.780]   We are all so familiar with them, and I am sure so utterly tired of them, I am saying
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.260]   that is not the primary business of the Church.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:53.180]   The primary business of the Church is to produce Christians.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.060]   You see, the thing is so short-sighted.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.100]   How can the Church ever have influence upon affairs of state?
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:03.500]   There is only one way, and that is by producing such a large number of Christians that the
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.580]   clever politicians have got to listen.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.700]   They will listen to votes, they listen to numbers, they do not listen to anything else.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.900]   But they do listen to numbers, it counts, it makes a difference, it can produce a change
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.680]   of government.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.900]   So they are governed by this.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:22.800]   Therefore I say the business of the Church is to produce such a large number of Christians
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.580]   that she has her influence and her effect upon everything.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:33.620]   But of course, in addition to that, the Church, in expounding the Scriptures, has a great
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.980]   deal to tell the state about itself.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.500]   Not that it is dictating, but it just reminds the state that the state is not something
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:46.180]   man has created, that the powers that be are ordained of God, that kings and princes hold
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.220]   their power from God and are under God.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.740]   And the Church has often done this.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.780]   Think of John Knox preaching to Mary, Queen of Scots, for instance, and many other examples
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.140]   that I could give you.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:02.720]   The Church is here to remind the state of what she is, where her functions begin and
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.980]   where they end.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.580]   So she has a great deal to tell the world in that way.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:14.580]   She can say certain things to the world this morning which nobody else can say, about why
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.700]   there are still wars and so on.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.300]   I am hoping to deal with this very thing, God willing, from this pulpit tonight.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:27.460]   However, I am summing it up by putting it like this.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:35.780]   That as the Church produces Christian individuals, those individuals then, by living their daily
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:44.180]   lives in the world and in the state, have a profound influence upon society.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:49.320]   Just imagine large numbers of Christian people, members of Parliament, if you like, doing
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:54.700]   this or that, in important positions in the land, in education, teaching, and so on.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:00.640]   Well, the influence is going to be endless, and that is the way in which the Church is
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   meant to function.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.300]   We are to be the salt of the earth, we are to be the light of the world.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.380]   We have this influence through being Christians.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.260]   Now the tragedy is, you see, that the Church, instead of doing it like that, as I said,
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.860]   has been doing the exact opposite.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:21.300]   It has been ignoring the individual, "Oh, that is selfish, that is a social gospel,
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   speak in general."
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.120]   And the numbers have gone down so much that the statesmen are not interested in what we
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.120]   say.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:33.900]   To put things right is, produce Christians, living, vibrant Christians, and in such numbers
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.220]   that everybody will have to listen.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.680]   Now, that is, I say, the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.900]   And this, now, I want to show you, is something that has been demonstrated on many occasions
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.620]   in the long history of the Christian Church.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.020]   Go back to the very beginning.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.740]   You read in the book of the Acts of the Apostles that when Paul and his traveling companions
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:05.060]   arrived at a certain place, the noise went abroad, the rumor spread, "These men that
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.100]   are turning the world upside down have come here also."
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.700]   Turning the world upside down, what were they preaching about?
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.660]   Did the Apostle Paul preach politics?
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.380]   Did the Apostle Paul give constant advice to the Emperor of Rome how he should conduct
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.380]   his affairs?
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.380]   Never.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.700]   Not on a single occasion he was preaching a personal gospel.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.540]   But you see, what was happening was this, individuals were being converted, a new kind
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.900]   of individual was appearing in society, and these were unique people.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.820]   They were different from everybody else.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.580]   They lived differently, they died differently, they could take persecution and calamity in
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.580]   a different way.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.580]   There was something about them, and it spread and it spread, and the authorities in Rome
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:54.660]   became aware of this peculiar people that had arisen, and that was the way in which
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:33:03.100]   they turned the world upside down—not by talking politics, but by just producing Christians.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:08.940]   And as I told you, though I regard it as a tragedy, it is interesting as an illustration
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.620]   of this principle.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:15.300]   Why was it that Constantine decided to become a Christian and to bring the Roman Empire
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.300]   in?
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.300]   Well, there is only one answer.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:22.460]   The Christians had become so numerous and were so important that it paid him to do so.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.060]   The tragedy is that the Church fell into the trap.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:33.300]   But Constantine was paying a great tribute, unconsciously, to the way that early Christians
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.140]   in those first centuries had preached the gospel truly.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.780]   Here was the gospel turning the world upside down.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:46.460]   And I need scarce to remind you that the Great Reformation period did exactly the same thing.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:51.180]   It did it in this country, it did it in many other countries.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:56.460]   The influence of the Protestant Reformation, not only upon government and politics, but
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:03.500]   even upon science and literature and all these things, is something beyond computation.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:10.260]   The glories of the first Elizabethan era are to be traced directly to the influence of
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.660]   the Protestant Reformation, but it was done through individuals.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.700]   It was the numbers of individuals that really brought it to pass.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.620]   It was not the Church talking generalities.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.340]   It was the Church producing Christians.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:30.260]   And then these Christian men, in their various realms and departments, shed the light abroad.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.580]   The same thing exactly in the period of the Commonwealth and the crumble, when the true
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:41.700]   greatness of this country perhaps was laid more firmly even than in the first Elizabethan
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.700]   era.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:47.060]   And there's no need to be in any doubt about what happened then.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:53.420]   Oliver Cromwell was a remarkable Christian man, a man of prayer, a man who hesitated
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.060]   to arrive at decisions unless he felt he'd got some inner sanction and authority from
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.060]   God.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:04.300]   And all the preaching that accompanied that, but above all, again, the numbers of Christian
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.300]   people.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.580]   The Puritan preaching had produced so many Christians that they became a power in the
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.580]   land.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:17.860]   It's the only explanation of that era, and indeed, coming nearer our own time.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.500]   Impartial historians like Leckie and others have always admitted that what saved this
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:28.140]   country from something analogous to the French Revolution was the evangelical or Methodist
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.060]   awakening of the eighteenth century.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:37.940]   And look at all the wonderful things that were done by people like Wilberforce and that
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:43.620]   group of interesting Christian people who were known as the Clapham sect, by Shaftesbury,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.220]   Lord Shaftesbury, and others later.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:50.820]   Now these were individuals, individual Christians, but they thought as Christians.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.900]   They applied their Christianity in all their spheres of interest and of activity.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.940]   Some of them went into Parliament, others worked in different ways, but they were all
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.420]   working together.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.860]   And the result was that looking at things superficially and generally, there was a reformation
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:12.340]   of morals and of everything else in the Victorian period, in the first part of the Victorian
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.340]   period.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.780]   It wasn't perfect, but it was very much better than what had gone before.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.900]   It was very much better than what is happening today.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.900]   Very well.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:27.060]   Now there you see are illustrations from history showing that when the Church remembers her
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:34.980]   primary function and preaches the gospel of salvation, and realizes that what matters
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:40.620]   is not the bulk but the individual, that the state, after all, is nothing but an aggregate
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:46.340]   of individuals, and that the way you put things right is not by trying to deal with the mass
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:53.700]   but by producing individuals whose influence permeates and spreads and radiates outwards.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:37:01.300]   Now that is both the teaching of the Scripture, it is at the same time something which is
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:07.820]   fully demonstrated and illustrated by the long history of the Christian Church in this
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.500]   and in every other country.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.180]   But this brings me to my last point, which is the purpose of all I have been trying to
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.180]   say.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:25.220]   What is it then that is essential before we can get such Christians, and get such Christians
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.060]   in large numbers?
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:32.580]   If you want to influence the government of this country, if you want to influence the
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.300]   whole world, there is only one way.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.180]   There must be so many Christians that the states will have to listen.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.060]   Not that we coerce them, not that we dominate them, but that with our moral influence and
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.380]   suasion in a general sense, over and above our particular gospel, they will have to listen
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.420]   to us.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.500]   What is essential?
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.220]   And the answer is, there are only two things that are essential.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:03.580]   The first is the understanding of the message, and that is why we are concentrating on this
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:08.460]   Gospel of John, which brings us to the very heart and centre of it.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.220]   That is why we are still looking at the case of that man Apollos.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.620]   Here was a man, you remember, we saw last Sunday morning, eloquent, mighty in the Scriptures,
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:26.060]   instructed in the way of the Lord, fervent in spirit, preaching with boldness, and indeed
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.180]   speaking and teaching accurately the things of the Lord.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:35.140]   But Aquila and Priscilla listened to him, and they recognised a lack, a deficiency,
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:42.900]   something wrong, and they teach him the way of the Lord more perfectly, more accurately.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:48.740]   And as a result of this, I am suggesting it was just their teaching about the Holy Spirit,
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:53.980]   the same teaching as Paul gave to these people at Ephesus in chapter 19, teaching, understanding.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.060]   Yes, perhaps he needed to be put right even on some aspects of the way of salvation in
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:05.020]   Jesus Christ, but that is the place to begin, and that is the very thing that the Apostle
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.020]   Paul did.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.940]   He said, "John verily baptised with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:15.820]   that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.660]   What they did was to preach Jesus Christ and him crucified, the great Christian doctrine
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.660]   of salvation.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.940]   There was no uncertainty about it.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.860]   And while the Church is uncertain about this, she is wasting her breath and her energy.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   Nobody listens to her.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.880]   She is not competent to speak about the things about which she is speaking.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.380]   This is the thing we are competent to speak about.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:42.700]   "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.340]   The judgment of God, the way of salvation, that is what they preached, that is what we
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.060]   must preach.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:54.720]   This is what we must all be aware of as individuals.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.660]   We must be right and clear about the message.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:02.140]   And so, you see, having been put right, what we read about Apollos is this, that when he
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:07.300]   was dispersed to pass into a care, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples there to receive
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:13.180]   him who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.380]   He understood now, and he was such an able man, he was a tremendous help to them.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.620]   But listen, "For he mightily convinced the Jews."
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.160]   The word that is used, translated here as "mightily," is a tremendous word.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.980]   He confuted them.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.180]   It even goes beyond that.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.700]   He completely demolished their arguments.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.640]   He mightily convinced the Jews.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:41.140]   He was able to put the case with such clarity, with such power, with such force, with such
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.820]   understanding, that they were rendered speechless.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:49.860]   They could not reply to him, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:57.020]   And as long as Jesus is represented merely as a social reformer, or a politician, or
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:02.420]   a pale Galilean, or a philosopher, he will have no influence, and men and women won't
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.420]   be affected.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.420]   Nobody will be silenced.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.620]   It will all be human opinion, and nothing will happen.
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.740]   But when we have the clear message, well, then things begin to happen.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:20.140]   But you see, on top of that, the power of the Holy Ghost, the baptism with power.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:24.340]   You can preach this correct Orthodox doctrine, but if you do it in your own strength and
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.980]   power, it will avail nothing.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.340]   Men and women won't listen, but with the power of the Holy Ghost, everything is different.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.580]   So the Apostle Paul was able to write to the Thessalonians and remind them exactly how
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.580]   they had become Christians.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:43.980]   And this is how he puts it, in 1 Thessalonians 1.5, he says, "Our gospel came not unto
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:55.540]   you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance."
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:59.180]   The word and the power of the Holy Ghost upon it.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:06.860]   These are the two essentials, and they are still the essentials.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:14.380]   And then you see all this enforced by the life of the individual Christians.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.180]   My dear friends, the world isn't going to listen to the Church.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:23.060]   The people with whom you mix and with whom you work, who are not Christians, are not
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:28.660]   going to listen to you, until you know exactly what you believe, you are able to explain
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.220]   the state of the world today to them, you are able to explain why we have had these
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:36.740]   two world wars and why things are as they are, once you have got an explanation.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:43.420]   And then you can show them the way out, and above all, when they see in you and in me
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:49.740]   something different, a way of facing war differently, a way of facing illness differently, a way
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:55.020]   of facing death differently, bereavement and sorrow and calamity and loss, when they see
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:59.860]   that we are different, they will begin to listen, but not until then.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:08.100]   So the two essentials are clear understanding of the message and the power of the Holy Ghost
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.240]   upon it.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:19.260]   In other words, the greatest need of the hour is that we should receive of his fullness
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:26.540]   and grace upon grace, to be baptized with his Spirit and his power, with the fire of
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.940]   the Holy Ghost, the clarity of understanding, the authority in the speaking, the authority
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.860]   and the power in the living.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:40.260]   These are the things that have always rendered Christian people the salt of the earth, the
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:47.500]   saviors of society, men and women who can hold up the torch and give a little light
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:56.680]   in the darkness and evil and iniquity of this present evil world.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.180]   That is still the way.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.180]   It is still the only way.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:06.900]   For me to talk politics here would not help you nor anybody else.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.060]   But if I preach this gospel and you believe it, and you have the power of the Spirit in
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:15.780]   you and are living it and are practicing it and are able to tell others about it, well,
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:23.180]   then God knows where this may not end and society and the state and everything else
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.740]   will be influenced.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:31.300]   That is the teaching of the scripture that is the great lesson of history to us this
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.300]   morning.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:38.860]   May God make of us such people that we shall be able to say with honesty, "I have received
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:45.820]   of his fullness and grace upon added to grace."
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.820]   Amen.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:56.340]   Now shall we join in singing hymn number 350.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.340]   We will omit the third verse.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:06.260]   Omitting the third verse, hymn number 350, "Brief life is here our portion, brief sorrow,
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:14.860]   short-lived care, the life that knows no ending, the tearless life is there," 350, omitting
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:21.860]   verse 3.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:44.420]   "Brief life is here our portion, brief sorrow, short-lived care, the life that knows no ending,
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:46:14.020]   the tearless life is there, the life that knows no ending, the life that knows no ending,
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:41.540]   the tearless life is there, the life that knows no ending, the tearless life is there,
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:47:10.100]   the life that knows no ending, the tearless life is there, the life that knows no ending,
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:37.620]   the tearless life is there, the life that knows no ending, the tearless life is there,
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:48:06.500]   the life that knows no ending, the tearless life is there, the life that knows no ending,
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:33.980]   the tearless life is there, the life that knows no ending, the tearless life is there,
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:59.180]   the tearless life is there, the tearless life is there, the tearless life is there, the
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:24.940]   tearless life is there, the tearless life is there, the tearless life is there, the
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:51.820]   tearless life is there, the tearless life is there.
