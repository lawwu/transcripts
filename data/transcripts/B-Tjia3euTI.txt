[00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.340]   Hi, this is Abner Chow, one of the translators of the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.660]   This month, they're releasing certain psalms for us to read.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.160]   And they've asked me, could I share any insights on these passages?
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400]   Well, that's kind of tricky.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.280]   It's a little bit tough because which passages do you choose?
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.040]   Which texts do you select?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.200]   I have about 150 favorite psalms.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.800]   So which one do we want to study?
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.240]   Well, I try to select a few where we not only learn some deep theology about God,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.480]   some things that encourage us and convict us, but also that would give us some tips
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.060]   on how to study our Bibles better, tips on what to look for as we read our Bibles
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.560]   and all of that to help us not only remember the scriptures, because if you
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.560]   know how it all breaks down and how you all can put it together, then you can
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.520]   remember it and recall it more.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.040]   You're familiar with it, but on top of that, it also helps us to be convicted by
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.160]   scripture better, because when you understand what each detail is doing and
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.840]   its significance, then you understand how it has significance in our lives and how
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.080]   it points on particular applications that need to happen in our heart to conform to
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.400]   the standard and the truth of God's word.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.240]   So that's kind of the design of the next series of videos that they've asked me to
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.120]   do on various passages in the Psalms.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.440]   And we're going to start with Psalm 62.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.360]   This is an amazing passage.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.800]   This is a wonderful text.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.160]   I read this passage all the time because what it reminds us and what it molds us to
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:54.480]   do is to have our peace and our security and our trust, even our silence in God.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.280]   This is so important how we need that.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.080]   And there is so much going on in this text to accomplish that goal.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.920]   There is so much happening, so much sophistication that all comes together to
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.240]   push us deeply and powerfully to that conclusion.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.240]   Now, I can't share everything or observe everything in the text that I possibly
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.880]   could. That would take a long time.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.760]   But let me give a few observations.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.720]   And the way I'd like to work it is that we'll start broad, zoom out, and then we'll
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.880]   move our way inward.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.960]   We'll zoom in.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.800]   So we'll start general and then become more specific.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.600]   And with that, we can start with structure, with the structure of this passage.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   Notice verse one, the psalmist begins with conviction.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.320]   Surely my soul waits in silence for God.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.640]   Verse two, surely he is my rock and my salvation.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.320]   Two phrases of conviction right next to each other.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.760]   And then there's some discussion.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.800]   And then notice a little bit later, he says in verse four, surely they have counsel to
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   thrust him down. So you have two parallel lines that begin with the word surely and
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.520]   then some discussion and then the word surely again.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.200]   Well, if you have that in mind, watch this verse five, surely wait in silence for God.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.080]   Verse six, again, a parallel line.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.960]   Surely he is my rock.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.160]   And then you have some discussion.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.720]   And guess what happens then?
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   In verse nine, it says, surely men of low degree are merely vanity.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.280]   Do you notice a pattern?
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.320]   Do you notice two verses, each of them begin with surely, then some discussion, and then
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   it concludes with the word surely.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.200]   What we have now then are two parallel sections.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.120]   This psalm breaks down into two major parts and you say, OK, what are the two major
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.720]   parts doing? How do they help us to understand how to have solace, how to have
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.800]   security, how to have peace in God all the more?
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.960]   Well, the first section you could say, at risk of oversimplification, is offense.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.560]   Offense. And the second section would be what we might call defense.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.360]   Another way to put it is that the first section is about something that is
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.480]   interpersonal and the second section is about something that is personal.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.840]   The first section might be about boldness and the last section might be something
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.760]   about perspective.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.960]   These are all ways to describe these two sections.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.200]   And let's think about them now, because if you understand that.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.160]   Trust in God is for times that are interpersonal and personal, if trust in God is
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.880]   times for things that are on the offense or on the defense, if trust in God is about
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.600]   boldness to the outside world or perspective in your own personal life, then trust in
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.000]   God is about everything.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.560]   It pertains to every single situation, every single moment.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.040]   And that's what Psalm 62 is driving at.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.440]   And let's get into the details of that.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:19.400]   In verse one, what we have is that the psalmist's confidence, our confidence, it
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.840]   needs to be convictional.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.680]   It is surely my soul waits in silence for God.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:35.560]   It is about our determination, our certainty, our exclusivity, that we must, we must and
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.360]   we must only find our peace in God.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.240]   He is my rock, no one else.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.640]   And I'm going to seek him.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.960]   That is our conviction.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.320]   That is our determination.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.960]   That's what we need to have.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.640]   And when we meditate on him in this way with such confidence, with such conviction, with
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:05.240]   such exclusivity, and we contemplate that he is our salvation, he is our rock, he is
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.920]   our salvation, he is our stronghold.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.880]   Notice what the text says.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.480]   Well, well, we won't fear.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.280]   We won't be greatly shaken.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.120]   And in fact, it's more than just that we won't fear.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.400]   We will even have, in a sense, an attitude of courage, an attitude of courage.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.200]   Notice verses three and four.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   It says, how long will you assail a man?
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.760]   The wicked that maybe intimidated us, the wicked that maybe caused us to fear, we
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.800]   don't fear them anymore.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.120]   We can stand up to them.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.720]   We can show that they are wicked.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.640]   We can point out boldly that they are in the wrong.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.840]   Surely, as it says in verse four, they have counseled to thrust him down from his high
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.680]   position. They are in the wrong.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.360]   And we are confident and courageous about it.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.640]   When we meditate on who God is, the outside world won't scare us.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.880]   We can stand up.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.680]   We can be bold and courageous against them.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.680]   And as we meditate and as the psalmist guides us in meditating on who God is, our
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.920]   confidence is building and that moves from the notion of offense to the notion of
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.000]   defense about something that is interpersonal now to something that is personal.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.320]   Because yes, we have to deal with the outside world, but sometimes we have to deal with
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.120]   ourselves. And in light of that, verse five and six repeats.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.240]   It repeats that we need to have, even in our own personal private lives, not when we're
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.440]   facing the outside world, but we're just facing ourselves in the private moments of
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.720]   our existence. We need to turn to God with the same kind of conviction, with the same
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.760]   kind of exclusivity, with the same kind of determination.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.840]   Surely wait in silence.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.560]   We command ourselves.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.680]   We command our own souls to be in silence because our hope is from him.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.240]   We look to him alone.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.600]   He is our rock.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.040]   He is our salvation.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.600]   He is our stronghold.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:11.400]   And notice this, because we are meditating and thinking about God, it says, I shall not
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.000]   be shaken.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.480]   Now, notice this.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.800]   In verse two earlier, it said something similar, but it said, I will not be greatly
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.520]   shaken here, it says, I will not be shaken.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.200]   Why? Because before I won't be greatly shaken, I won't be shaken a lot.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.160]   But somebody, a skeptic could step in and say, but would you be shaken a little?
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.840]   But by verse six, because we have meditated on God, we have lived it out.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.080]   We understand our confidences in him.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.680]   We have thought about him a lot and alone.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.960]   Now, the psalmist says, and we should say with him, I won't be shaken implied at all,
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.320]   at all. That is our confidence in God, that kind of confidence, because he is our
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.280]   salvation. Our glory rests in him.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.760]   He is the rock of my strength.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.840]   My refuge is in God.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.720]   These realities, they drive us to perspective.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.040]   Perspective. Notice verses nine.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:18.720]   And ten, we have perspective, we begin to understand and see through the wicked, they
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   may appear to be evil and they are.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.520]   But they may appear to be intimidating in that evil.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.640]   They may appear to be scary in that evil.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.080]   But we can see through them.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.760]   And here's what they are.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.320]   And notice what the text says.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   They're just vanity.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.880]   That's what they are.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.480]   And notice they are together lighter than what vanity.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.520]   Do you notice the repetition of vanity?
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.040]   Here is what the psalmist is reminding us.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.960]   See through them.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.760]   If your confidence is in God, you can see through them.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.800]   They may look formidable, but they're nothing.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.680]   They're vanity.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.480]   Their work may seem powerful and effective.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.240]   No, it's just a breath of vanity.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.600]   It amounts to nothing.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.680]   That's what they really are.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:07.440]   And when we know God and think about him, all the concerns out there, they grow dim.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.440]   They're no longer scary.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.160]   They're no longer fearful because we have such a big and faithful and powerful God.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.720]   And for that very reason, verse 10, don't trust in oppression.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.000]   And notice the next phrase.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.880]   Do not put vain hope in robbery.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.000]   We don't act like the wicked.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.680]   We don't follow the wicked.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.040]   Why?
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.000]   Because what did we hear in verse nine?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.480]   They are vanity and what they do amounts to vanity.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.720]   Everything they are, everything they have, everything that they will be is vanity.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:47.120]   So if you do what they do, all you have is a vain hope because they're just vanity.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.080]   They're nothing.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.080]   And so we don't follow them.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.680]   Why?
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.160]   Because they're vanity.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.760]   Why?
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:02.120]   Because our hope and our confidence and our rest and our silence and our solace is in who?
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.400]   It's in God.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.720]   That's what the psalmist has been emphasizing.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.040]   He has said it over and over again.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.880]   Surely, surely, surely this is what we should be about.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.920]   We should be determined about this and it should be the exclusive cry of our heart.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.280]   It is all about God and it's for that very reason that our verses 11 and 12 sum it up.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.720]   They provide the conclusion.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.680]   Once God has spoken twice, I have heard this, that strength belongs to who?
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.560]   To God.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.760]   Everything belongs to him.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.720]   Therefore we turn to no one else but him.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.080]   Surely my soul rests in him.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.560]   That's why all loving kindness belongs to him.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.120]   We go to him and him alone.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.200]   These are such important lessons.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:01.040]   If you're facing something on the outside world and it intimidates you, we need to go to God.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.120]   If we are facing our own personal fears and doubts, we go to God.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.600]   If we need boldness and courage, we go to God.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.000]   If we need perspective in this life, we go to God.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.880]   If something is disturbing us, we go to God.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   Surely we go to him.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.480]   That's what this psalm is pressing us on.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:27.120]   As verse eight exhorts us so eloquently, trust in him at all times.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   So people pour out your heart before him.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.920]   God is a refuge for us.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.160]   Surely we need to go to God.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.720]   This is so powerful.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.000]   This is so good.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.160]   And the applications are so vast and so practical.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.440]   We need this.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:54.080]   And I pray that by looking at some things in the text, we not only understand our God better,
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.240]   we understand what we need to do in trusting him all the more and finding peace in him.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.160]   God's word is so beautiful.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.360]   It's so wonderful.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.800]   And my prayer is that we continue to strive to see great and wonderful things in his word.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.560]   And in light of that, I hope that we can have more opportunities where we can go and see
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.720]   great insights and beautiful things in the word of God together.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.280]   Look forward to the next time.
