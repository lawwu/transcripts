[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.720]   It's Friday here at Radical Personal Finance, and on Fridays, we do live Q&A.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.280]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.280]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.280]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.000]   This is the show where we work hard to give you the tools and tactics and strategies and
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   information and inspiration that you need to live a rich life now while also building
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.320]   and then pursuing your plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.400]   Fridays is where you ask me questions.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:54.600]   We open up the phone line, and you can ask me anything that you want.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.800]   Most Friday Q&A calls are a benefit which is open to patrons of the show at a certain
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   level of subscription.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.960]   For details on that, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.640]   If you sign up as a patron of the show, you can call in, and you can ask me anything that
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640]   you want.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.240]   It might be a good and relatively inexpensive way for you to – well, if you want to get
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.680]   my opinion or advice on something, this is a good way to do it.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.240]   So let's go immediately to Paul in Hawaii.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.160]   Paul, go ahead and let me know what's on your mind, and let me know how I can serve
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   you today, please.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.680]   Thanks, Josh, and aloha.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.280]   My wife is looking to retire, and she'll reach full retirement age in about a year.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.240]   We're looking then at delaying Social Security until 70, and I wanted to see what the break-even
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.640]   point would be from taking Social Security at 70 versus 66.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.280]   All right.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.120]   So this one is interesting, and I will be able to give you some generalized advice,
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.960]   but I'll also – ultimately, I'm going to point you to a book and the very best book
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.640]   that is written on this subject.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.960]   The reason I'm pointing you to a book is because it's not a simple answer.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.240]   There are many extenuating factors, and it'll be more that I can do just simply off the
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.760]   cuff with my – I'll practice in this area every day.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.800]   I can give you a generalized idea, but the book that you need is a book called Social
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:28.720]   Security Strategies, and the authors are William Reichenstein, R-E-I-C-H-E-N-S-T-E-I-N, and
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.920]   William Meyer, and I will link it in the show notes for today's episode for any other
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920]   listeners.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.840]   But this book, Social Security Strategies, is the best resource that I have found to
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.040]   help people walk through this decision tree and to pull out some of the misconceptions
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.760]   that people have about their different situation and give some useful ideas.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.240]   This really is the best place to go, and if you're going through this situation and
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.240]   you'd like to work your way through it yourself, go first to this book, Social Security Strategies.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.080]   Now, there are a couple of different extenuating factors that you'll want to consider.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.720]   The first is going to be the idea of the payment, and as you said, we often talk about, "Okay,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.320]   what's the break-even point?"
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.480]   We'll get to that in a minute, but some of the other ideas can often be even more
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.600]   important, so we'll get to those in just a couple minutes.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.680]   So she is currently—how old right now?
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.920]   William Meyer, MD 65.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920]   And how old are you?
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.120]   William Meyer, MD I'm 67.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   Okay.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.400]   So you guys are similar in age, and that is important because when it comes to different
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.760]   strategies, there's a dramatic difference of strategy you would pursue if you're similar
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.960]   in age versus if you are significantly different in age.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   Next question.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.920]   With regard to your earnings record and her earnings record, the first ideal question
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.320]   is do you know what her primary insurance amount is and what your primary insurance
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.560]   amount is on your Social Security earnings record?
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.000]   William Meyer, MD Yes.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Okay.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   What are those numbers, please?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.280]   William Meyer, MD Okay.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.040]   I drew at 62 for medical reasons.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.120]   At 66, her numbers will be $1568.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   At 70, it will be $2169.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.240]   That's what they're estimating right now.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   Okay.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.880]   And what is your current Social Security benefit?
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.760]   William Meyer, MD $1500.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   $1500.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   Okay.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.560]   So the key with—it's going to be difficult for me to answer the question because I can't
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.800]   do it off the top of my head.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.280]   This is more of kind of a consultation where you've got to go through and look at some
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   different strategies.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.120]   Let me just give you a couple of things to think about and I'm just going to frankly
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.640]   just refer you right to the Social Security Strategies book that I mentioned for you.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.160]   The key with thinking about the benefit is to think partly about the actual benefit amount.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.280]   Now, there is a compelling case to be made for waiting until full retirement age and
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.800]   also for late retirement age.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.120]   When you actually look at the increase of the benefits—let me pull this up here.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.720]   I'll read this to you here so you get an idea.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   So here we go.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.960]   I'm just going to read you a couple of paragraphs from the very beginning here of the Social
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.200]   Security Strategies book which is going to partly answer your age question and it will
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.480]   be useful for you to consider this.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.120]   Someone who begins benefits at full retirement age receives full benefits, that is, the primary
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.880]   insurance amount.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.560]   Someone who begins benefits before attaining full retirement age receives reduced benefits
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.360]   while someone who delays benefits until after the full retirement age receives a higher
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.040]   level of benefits.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.440]   So the reductions and increases for someone with a full retirement age of 66 are important
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.240]   because this affects most individuals who will be deciding when to begin Social Security
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.200]   benefits in the next several years.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.760]   If this individual begins Social Security benefits before attaining full retirement
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:17.400]   age, the reduction is 5/9 of a percent per month for the first 36 months plus 5/12 of
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.720]   a percent per month for months 37 through 48.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:32.760]   So if benefits are begun at 62, 63, 64, or 65, the reduction is 25%, 20%, 13.33%, and
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.860]   6.67% respectively below the primary insurance amount.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.680]   If benefits are begun at 63 years and one month, then the reduction is 19.44% where
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.040]   the latter is 35 months times 5/9 of a percent reduction per month.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.920]   Now that's a bunch of numbers that are very hard for listeners to follow in audio form,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.000]   but it's important that people actually look at the actual numbers because they change
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.360]   depending on how early you take the benefit.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.880]   Now to your situation, Paul, let's continue here.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:10.740]   If benefits are begun after the full retirement age, the increase is 2/3 of a percent per
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.880]   month for each month benefits are delayed until age 70.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   So if benefits are begun at 67, 68, 69, or 70, the increases in benefits called delayed
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:33.000]   retirement credits are 8%, 16%, 24%, and 32% respectively above the primary insurance
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.180]   amount.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.140]   If benefits are begun three months after attaining full retirement age, then the delayed retirement
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.060]   credit is 2%.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.300]   That's three months times 2/3 of a percent per month.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.420]   So the monthly benefits level is 102% of the primary insurance amount.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.140]   This example and a prior one emphasizes that someone does not need to wait a full year,
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.880]   for example from 63 to 64 or 66 to 67, to get a higher benefit amount.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:05.780]   The benefit amount increases each month that benefits are delayed from age 62 to 70.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:11.860]   For someone with a full retirement age of 66 and primary insurance amount of $1,000,
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:24.020]   the levels of benefits if started at 62 through 70 would be $750 at 62, $800, $866, $933,
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:37.420]   $1,000 at 66, $1,080, $1,160, $1,240, and $1,320 at 70.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.360]   All amounts are adjusted for annual cost of living adjustments.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.700]   So one of the key things to recognize is that there is a substantial increase in actual
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.260]   benefits by waiting from the full retirement age up through the age of 70.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:01.040]   To duplicate these results with any other kind of investment is very, very difficult.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:08.220]   Just compare this example here of going from $1,000 a month of benefit at 66 to $1,320
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:14.740]   a month of benefit at age 70 and go back and run the math on how much of an investment
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:23.620]   account you would need to have to approximate that result of a 32% increase over four years.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.700]   So four years of delay and a 32% increase in benefit.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:33.180]   As the author points out here, that's very, very valuable because of the increase but
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:42.620]   also because of the fact that that increase now benefits from all of the cost of living
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.740]   adjustments going forward into the future.
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.220]   So those things are – it's an extremely valuable benefit.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:54.140]   Now it's not necessarily the biggest thing that you have to focus on but most people
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.660]   should probably delay for as long as possible.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.420]   Now, Paul, tell me a little bit more about your other financial situation, other resources,
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.420]   things like that, please.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.340]   We've got a fully paid four-house.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.340]   So we have no mortgage.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.340]   We have no debt.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:17.940]   We've got about 300K in IRA and 401K.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.540]   And that's emergency fund about 80K.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.380]   And that's kind of our situation right now.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.380]   Okay, great.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:30.700]   So the good thing is you are in great shape as far as no debt and you have some assets
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.800]   which is fantastic.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.700]   With regard to your income, you're living on your social security income and then her
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:42.100]   earned income up until now, are you currently taking income from the investments?
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.500]   No.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:53.100]   No, we're putting about 30%, 40% towards savings each month.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.340]   So our expenses are very much in line.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.340]   Great.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.340]   Awesome.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:04.900]   So the reason the amount of assets are important is if you had – if you have millions and
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.600]   millions of dollars of assets, then the social security benefit is not going to be a major
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.980]   part of your or your wife's retirement picture.
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:21.600]   If you have fewer assets, then the social security benefit begins to form a really important
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:33.860]   foundation of the overall plan of how you're actually going to receive income.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.740]   You mentioned that you took social security early for health reasons.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:43.300]   Do you expect to live to a normal age or do you expect to die early?
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   Probably a normal age.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.080]   I'm going to say probably a normal age.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.980]   And is your wife in good health?
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.380]   Does she expect to have a long life expectancy?
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.260]   Yeah, she has some good family genes.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.260]   Okay.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.260]   So under these circumstances, you asked in your original question about break-even point.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:07.420]   And the basic break-even points are pretty easy to calculate.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.560]   I'm just looking here in the book here to read you a paragraph.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:20.640]   So if we were just talking about a single person and the way that these strategies are
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   broken apart is strategies for single people versus strategies for couples.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.640]   I'm going there in just a moment.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.600]   But if we were just going for a single person, here would be the implications here as far
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.800]   as the break-even point.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.600]   Let's consider the implications for single individuals who are only concerned about maximizing
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.720]   expected cumulative lifetime benefits.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:47.560]   If a 62-year-old expects to live to age 77, i.e. die in the month of his 77th birthday,
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.200]   he maximizes cumulative benefits by starting benefits at age 64.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.920]   The reductions in benefits for starting benefits before the full retirement age are five-ninth
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.220]   of a percent per month for the first 36 months and five-twelfths of a percent per month for
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:08.440]   each additional month benefits begin before age 63.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.560]   Since five-ninth of a percent is larger than five-twelfths of a percent, the benefit of
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.200]   delaying benefits one more month increases at age 63.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.080]   This pattern encourages individuals to delay the start of benefits until at least 64 unless
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:28.000]   they are confident they will not live to at least 77.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.800]   Now let's consider the implications for singles of delaying the start of benefits beyond full
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.240]   retirement age.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:40.620]   The break-even age between starting benefits at age 66 and 67 is 79.5 years.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:46.400]   This relatively low break-even age reflects the two-thirds of a percent per month delayed
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.520]   retirement credits for delaying the start of benefits beyond the full retirement age.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.900]   Because this two-thirds of a percent is larger than the five-ninth of a percent reduction
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.320]   in benefits for starting benefits before full retirement age, the break-even age between
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   starting benefits at 66 and 67 is lower than the break-even age between starting benefits
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.360]   at 65 and 68.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.540]   If a 62-year-old expects to live until 82 and a half, then she would maximize expected
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.880]   lifetime benefits by delaying benefits until age 68.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.180]   However, if she is also concerned about longevity risk, she may rationally opt to delay benefits
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.600]   beyond age 68.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.560]   So skipping down here, the break-even ages are 80 or lower for delaying Social Security
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:36.840]   benefits one more year at ages 62, 63, 64, 65, and 66, but the break-even ages are above
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.840]   80 for delaying benefits one more year at ages 67, 68, and 69.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:47.360]   Therefore, it is easier to justify delaying the start of benefits from age 62 to 67 than
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.960]   from age 67 to 70.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.160]   So this is very wordy, but the reason I'm reading it is to demonstrate this is partly
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.860]   why I can't just answer the question for you without more detailed analysis, but I do encourage
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.680]   you to go to Social Security strategies and get the book and read through it carefully.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.120]   Now when you get to couples strategies, one of the important things about couples strategies
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:17.880]   is to recognize that there are a few different types of risks that we've got to figure out.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.560]   And when you have a couple, you have your Social Security benefits and then also your
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.600]   wife's Social Security benefits.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.980]   And we need to plan for both your benefits continuing for a long life and then what happens
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.980]   if you die early.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.260]   And we also need to plan for your wife's benefits continuing for a long life and what happens
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.200]   if she dies early.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.640]   So if you expect a long life expectancy, then usually it's good to just push it about as
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.200]   late as you can.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.220]   And there are benefits with those increases beyond the full retirement age.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.500]   Those are benefits because if you look at somebody's last decade of their life, how
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.100]   big of a difference having that higher Social Security benefit can be over the last decade,
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:07.300]   and especially recognizing that it's a benefit that you can't outlive, it's a huge, huge
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.300]   benefit.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.660]   The other thing that you've got to consider is you've got to say, "Okay, what would be
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.620]   the benefit for you if your wife died early?"
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.460]   And so when you look at it, you look at the benefit at age 70 and you say, because in
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:24.060]   your situation, Paul, you've been living on your Social Security benefit and then your
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.740]   wife's earned income.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.620]   So we've got to protect you in case your wife dies early and we want to make sure the spousal
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.900]   benefit for you is as high as possible.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.700]   And then also we need to look at the flip side for your wife and say, "Well, if Paul
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.700]   dies early, how do we make sure that her benefit is as high as possible?"
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.820]   It's important, the variation in ages.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.460]   If you have a low ratio, and just a second, let me find that part of my book here to give
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:17:05.540]   it to you, and I'll get you here the example here for a low ratio couple.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.740]   But you're going to need to go through this book and answer it specifically for yourself.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.740]   Is this helpful?
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.700]   I know I'm kind of walking around your question without giving it straightforward, but do
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.700]   you want to ask a follow-up question?
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.700]   Is this at all helpful for you?
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:25.540]   Overall, I've gone through this through my head and kind of worked out some, I worked
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.780]   it out on pencil.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:35.660]   Your help, it's nice to bounce back what I was initially thinking in terms of whether
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.180]   she goes or I go and what's available for either of us.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.580]   A follow-up question to that then, if we decide not to collect and say delay because of that
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:51.300]   8% increase each year thereafter, I'm also looking at an option of taking some cash out
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:58.260]   rather than taking Social Security, taking cash out, you know, every six months, whatever,
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:04.100]   to cover what she would receive on Social Security, take it from our 401(k) given our
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.860]   taxes will be much lower at that time.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.340]   Is that a reasonable option?
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:15.740]   Because my overall goal is to preserve capital and that's the primary goal, would be to
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.380]   preserve capital then with regards to our IRA and 401(k).
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.140]   Yeah, I think that's a reasonable goal.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:29.300]   Is she committed certainly to actually retiring from her work regardless of whether she takes
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.060]   Social Security distribution or not?
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.860]   You know, we've got some options and so to have these choices, it's really nice and
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.020]   so that's why I'm planning out ahead what those options might be because, you know,
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.820]   who knows, she might come home and say, "I've had it already.
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.820]   It's time to move on."
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.820]   Sure.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.820]   And I just want to be prepared.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.820]   Absolutely.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:55.180]   So if it were coming down to, given what you told me about, okay, $300,000, $300,000 of
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.340]   investments is a nice nest egg to have saved up.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.240]   So $300,000 of investments, that's fantastic.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.640]   As far as the income that you'll actually be able to build off of that, depending on
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.880]   how much you take on it, the income from that into perpetuity is going to be relatively
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:21.100]   low, meaning that if we just follow the 4% rule for example, 4% per year would be $12,000
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.640]   per year of benefit.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.360]   So in order to do that, you'll need to compare the cost of waiting on Social Security of
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:37.480]   what actual figures you don't get in and compare it with the benefit coming in from the Social
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.160]   Security and kind of compare those two.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.840]   The huge benefit of Social Security at your age bracket, I would expect that your age
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.640]   bracket, Social Security system to be relatively stable going forward into your retirement
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640]   years.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.340]   I don't expect the same for me in my age bracket.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.360]   But for you guys, I would expect it to be relatively stable.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:04.560]   And if you can set up a pension income that is going to last for your entire lifetimes
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.120]   and it's adjusted with COLA, that is very, very powerful and it's in many ways more powerful
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:17.400]   than what you can have just simply by having your investments in a mutual fund.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.920]   So I would personally lean toward that and explore it with the actual numbers.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.400]   I would make a spreadsheet and build it out.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.260]   But my gut reaction is yes.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:37.440]   If I needed to take $10,000 or $15,000 or $20,000 out of the retirement income to supplement
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.440]   while waiting for that Social Security income to increase, I would pursue that.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.880]   Do you have the paper there in front of you that tells you what her benefits would be
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.440]   at age 70 versus now at 66 or 65?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   Yes.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   I gave that to you earlier.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.440]   Okay.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.440]   I see it.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.440]   2169.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.440]   Okay.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   Forgive me.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   So 2169 minus 1568.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:04.800]   So that's $600 a month of additional benefit from waiting basically these four or five
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.160]   years.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.400]   Multiply that times 12.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:15.760]   That comes out to be $7,212 per year of income, of benefit.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.800]   That's a substantial increase in lifestyle.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.520]   If you were to replace that, this is just rough and dirty, let's just multiply that
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:35.760]   times 2169 minus 1568, 601.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.480]   Let's multiply that times 300.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.640]   So that's a portfolio value.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.280]   To create something similar, you'd need in excess of $180,000 of savings.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:50.200]   So even if you're looking at working and you're looking at the ability to defer that,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.840]   it's going to be a good increase in savings.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   That's probably the extent I can do on a live call like here without building a spreadsheet
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.200]   and comparing options.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.240]   I do commend you to the book Social Security Strategies and I commend you to a spreadsheet
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.000]   to actually look at it.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.480]   In that context as well, the last comment I would make is you need to look at her earnings
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.200]   record on the Social Security earnings.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.600]   And let me just ask you, what's her current income right now?
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.800]   About 50K.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   Okay.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.840]   And is that the highest that she's earned in her past career?
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.200]   Yeah, she's gone up a bit but not much.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.880]   So the other thing that you should check is you should check to see what happens in her
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:46.600]   earnings record if she replaces older years of lower income with current years of higher
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   income.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.800]   So the way the Social Security calculation works is it takes the 35 years of highest
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.760]   income – is it highest income or the last 35 years?
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:02.920]   I think it's 35 years of highest income and it calculates from that the primary insurance
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   amount.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:10.040]   So sometimes if somebody's earnings record looked like $20,000 a year, $20,000 a year,
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:14.520]   a straight $20,000 a year for 20 years or 15 years and then after that it made a big
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:20.720]   jump in income, sometimes putting in five more years of earnings can make a big difference
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.400]   in the formula because for every year that she's getting rid of a $20,000 record and
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.840]   replacing with a $50,000 record, that can dramatically raise the amount.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.720]   So you should look at her earnings record and see if there are any benefits that would
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.640]   be accrued from that as well.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.640]   Got you.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.640]   Okay.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   It's also important – sorry.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:45.280]   I know I'm going on and on but it's also important if she has any years of zero income.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:53.320]   So what can often happen with women, especially if they've taken time out of the career
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.520]   workforce to stay at home with kids, is they'll have some years of zero dollars of income.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:04.400]   And so if she's working and she's getting rid of a zero in the amount and replacing
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:10.320]   it with a $50,000 per year number, that can make a substantial difference as well.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.480]   That's an important consideration.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   I never looked at that part.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.080]   I think I'll go back and take a closer look at that.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.080]   Yep.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.080]   Go back and check it.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:24.720]   You can actually build the entire formula yourself with a spreadsheet.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.460]   If you get that book and you make a spreadsheet, if you're pretty proficient with spreadsheets,
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.360]   you can actually build an entire thing yourself.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.740]   You put in the earnings record, you follow the formula to pull off the earnings record,
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.680]   and you can create the primary insurance amount off of that, and then you can take that and
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.400]   you can use some of the different estimators.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.200]   But you can actually build it.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.480]   That's the best I got for you.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.480]   Very good.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   I got a follow-up question.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   Okay.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.480]   Go ahead.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.480]   I got you on my – myself.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   I want to ask you this.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.760]   I want to look at the issue of term insurance.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.120]   We're getting up in age, and it's getting pricey.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:10.840]   But at the same time, when I look at the benefit amount, the fact that it's not taxable at
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:19.680]   the time that the benefits collect, I kind of – I bit the bullet and said, "We're
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.880]   going to just keep it because I'm looking at that benefit as a – I'm going to say
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:32.120]   investment because I can't get that type of return anywhere else by paying that monthly
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   premium."
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.280]   You got where I'm coming from?
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.240]   Do you already have coverage in force that you're trying to decide whether to keep or
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.760]   to get rid of, or would you be applying for new coverage?
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.720]   Well, no.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.160]   We're looking at applying for new coverage.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.520]   The renewable data is at 75, and I'm quite a ways away from that.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.560]   But I'm still – I'm trying to look at what the premium amount might be.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560]   And so, I'm trying to rationale.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:05.080]   It may be, in fact, more reasonable for me to pay that increase knowing then that the
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.920]   return on that will be much greater than I can get anywhere else.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:17.200]   And so, that's why I'm looking at that term insurance policy as a policy, as an investment,
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.360]   rather than – I don't know how to explain that.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.640]   That's kind of where I'm coming from.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.680]   For me, I would not follow that path.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.040]   And the reason I wouldn't is because it's very unlikely for you to actually collect
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.880]   a death benefit on a term insurance policy.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.580]   The insurance underwriters are really good.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:46.640]   And in general, term insurance is just simply not going to pay out in general because you're
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.800]   going to outlive it.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:53.920]   So, when you get up to your age, in about your mid-60s, something like that, you're
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.840]   going to be – in order to keep it cost-effective, you're going to be looking at pretty short-term
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   rates.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.320]   You're going to be looking at 10-year term, maybe 15-year term.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.680]   But there's going to be a huge difference in premium cost between a 10-year term policy
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.000]   and a 20-year term policy.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.620]   And so, at your age bracket, you're going to be looking for a shorter-term policy.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:20.880]   And if you get the coverage, you're getting it because the insurance company has underwritten
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:28.580]   your file and they do not find any medical risk factors of an early death.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:34.520]   So basically, you have to assume when you buy life insurance, term life insurance, if
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.560]   you get it from the insurance company, basically – although, hey, medical things change all
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   the time.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.880]   You could look totally healthy today and then a year from now be diagnosed with cancer and
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.320]   you never knew it.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.100]   That happens and that does happen.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.200]   But when you actually look at it, it happens such a small percentage of the time that you
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.880]   basically have to think of it as protecting you from an accident.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:01.000]   It would protect you from an accidental death and so it would protect you from an accidental
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   death, not so much from the other types of death.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.560]   The insurance underwriting process, they're pretty good.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.800]   So the way I would look at it is as risk management.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:16.320]   If you look at your situation and let's say it would be on your wife's life right
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.240]   now because she's the one who's earning an income.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.360]   You don't have any income other than your social security benefit.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.360]   Is that right?
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.360]   Michael Strong: Correct.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   Aaron Ross Powell: OK.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:31.040]   So the major risk is of your wife dying early because your income – she would still have
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.220]   the paid-for house.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.720]   She would still have the retirement assets and she's going to have a social security
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.800]   benefit for herself and even if you died now and she wasn't claiming, she can file for
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:47.520]   a spousal benefit and get a spousal benefit or she can get a widow benefit off of your
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.580]   record.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:56.360]   So the major risk is for you, the loss of her income and the loss of her probably higher
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.200]   social security benefit to you.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.720]   If you needed to protect that for the next five years, that would be where I would look
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.120]   at life insurance.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:13.440]   So if you assume that she's going to earn $50,000 per year for the next five years and
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:22.080]   that's going to give you guys $250,000 of earnings, some of that is going to be spent
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.680]   but some of it is also going to be saved.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.160]   Plus you're going to have that increase in social security benefits for you.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.040]   I would consider putting some life insurance on her to protect that.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.400]   But I wouldn't view term life insurance as an investment simply because it's very unlikely
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.880]   to ever pay a death benefit.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.160]   There is protection.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.880]   It would pay a death benefit if you died but you're unlikely to die, especially at your
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.680]   age bracket when you're going through medical underwriting.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   Yeah, and that's the other side of insurance we don't talk about.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.480]   When you need it, it's great that it's there.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.320]   When you don't need it, it's money that's kind of gone.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.400]   Yeah, term insurance especially because term insurance only pays you out if you die.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.960]   It's great protection.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.520]   Again, it's the perfect fit if you decide she's going to work five more years, you're
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:12.440]   not quite comfortable and you buy a five-year $250,000 term policy that would run you on
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.320]   her life, it would be somewhere between $1,000 and $1,500 a year.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:22.160]   So that might be a really reasonable risk thing to do but it's not going to be an investment
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.280]   because it's unlikely to pay out.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:30.160]   It would be a shame to spend $1,500 a year and then it's all gone.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.520]   You've always got to recognize that most likely the premium dollars are going to be gone.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   Very good.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.160]   Listen, you've been most helpful and I appreciate your feedback.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   Good.

[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.600]   And at the moment, that is going to be it for today's show.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   I just had one caller.

[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   questions.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.680]   Really appreciate those of you who do call in.
