[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about how all
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.400]   Families or most families can get more free money
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.940]   Financial aid for college now
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.400]   I have literally spent 10 hours trying to figure this out how to get more free
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.680]   financial aid for college in terms of grants and scholarships and
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.760]   you should listen to this because
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.000]   College is crazy expensive and there are easily
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.400]   Many strategies to take to get free money and we all love free money
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.680]   But it's those families those people who plan ahead who are able to get the free money
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.880]   So if you have young kids the younger the better the more time you have to plan your life accordingly
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.880]   And I think you could get
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.840]   hundred grand two hundred grand maybe in
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.840]   Free money to send your kid to school and if that's the case you can afford better schools
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.960]   Because the better schools tend to be more stingy with their financial aid because they have so much demand
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.060]   But if you can figure out how to work the FAFSA system, and if you can get into these universities
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.440]   You will likely get more money a lot of times
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.480]   we look at it only from our point of view as a student or as a parent and say oh we got to do as
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.800]   Best as we can in school so that we can get into all these great schools
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.960]   But the reality is there's also another side of the equation, which is the very competitive process of universities trying to recruit
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.000]   Students they want for four years to pay their tuition. It's a business
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.360]   Nonprofit or profit it's a business and it's competitive process in terms of rankings prestige
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.320]   Funding all that stuff
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.440]   And so if you have the ability to look at both sides of the equation for the college admissions process and the college financial aid process
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.160]   You're gonna do better than the family who doesn't plan who doesn't read about the process who doesn't listen to the strategies
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   Who doesn't talk to?
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.880]   financial aid counselors
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.940]   This system is super complex and I'm trying to help you
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.320]   Save a lot of money for your children because the last thing you want to do is spend a ton of money on college
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.680]   For four or five years end up unemployed or underemployed with student debt
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.400]   So first, let me talk about a top-down philosophy of quote gaming the college financial aid system
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.680]   Gaming sounds bad, but in reality we all game the system. We don't cheat the system
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.140]   We game the system by understanding the rules of the game
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.260]   Once we understand the rules of the game
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.320]   We can more strategically play the game and win and the reality is colleges
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.440]   Themselves have been gaming the system as well in terms of raising their tuition rates
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.220]   So high faster than the rate of inflation over the past several decades that it's making college
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.000]   Unaffordable for the average middle-class family, you know
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.280]   we're talking 83,000 all in per year at a top private university or just any private university and
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.540]   About what 40,000 43,000 a year at a public university
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.760]   That's a lot of money folks. But what colleges are doing is they're raising their prices aggressively to signal quality to signal
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.720]   prestige and to get more people to come and then what they do is they kind of backdoor where they say well
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.160]   We accept your kid and we're gonna give you this quote merit
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.660]   Scholarship or need based aid to lower the net price. So it's you know having a high price
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.100]   You know you when you go shopping you see, you know, these fancy brands Gucci Prada, whatever
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.320]   very expensive but then
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:55.080]   Secretly they say hey, we'll give you 30% off 40% off 50% off. So it's a signaling effect to lure
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.960]   unassuming and assuming families to apply to their colleges and let's say the application fee is
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.500]   What $100 and a hundred thousand people apply?
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.660]   Well, that's a lot of application fee money
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.900]   And if the acceptance rate is 5% 10% 15% 20%
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.000]   well, they get to keep a lot of that and a lot of the families are therefore
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.600]   SOL and then there's the common app where a lot of families are just applying to many colleges at once
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.080]   Because they just have to check the box check check check check check and apply
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.840]   Yeah, you might have to tailor your essay accordingly
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:40.240]   but the whole process has brought in way more demand and yet the price of college has gone up crazy and
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.720]   Higher-education is largely free. Thanks to the internet. Meanwhile
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.840]   Meritocracy is kind of a hazy hazy area now in the past used to be top grades
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.320]   Top SAT scores top ACT scores top extracurricular activities and you'll get into the college of your choice with aid
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.000]   now
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.220]   Colleges, you know are picking and choosing who gets to enter and who doesn't and the world is not fair
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:17.040]   So again, if you can prepare the more you can learn about the financial aid system the better and you've definitely got to read my post
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.200]   on
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.920]   Gaming the college financial aid system. Alright, so after doing tons of research
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:30.840]   speaking to parents speaking to financial aid counselors reading books and more there is this thing I call the
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.920]   300,000 income and
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.020]   300,000 asset per child guideline in other words if your household makes up to
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.700]   $300,000 and if you have less than
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.380]   $200,000 in assets per child
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.700]   outside of your taxed advantage retirement accounts like 401k Roth IRA
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:00.780]   Then you have a chance to get free money good financial aid in terms of grants and scholarships
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.380]   if your household makes over three hundred thousand dollars, you know, that's like a top 10% income and
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.100]   If your assets are more than two hundred thousand per child
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.100]   Well, you're gonna have a very difficult time getting that free money and you're gonna have to go that merit aid route
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.020]   But the good thing about the merit aid route is that a lot of colleges are
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:27.360]   Couching or disguising need based aid as merit aid they call it merit based aid instead
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.860]   Because it sounds better
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.380]   So if you're trying to woo that student to join your university to pay whatever for four years
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:42.580]   If you say good job, we like you. We love you. Here's some merit aid. It just sounds better and feels better
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.580]   So it's really smart
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.040]   marketing smart strategy for schools to utilize
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.620]   All right, so given roughly 90% of households make less than three hundred thousand dollars
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.700]   Learning the college financial aid system is important now
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:05.020]   The bottom line is you want to make yourself look as poor as possible on the FAFSA
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.460]   Form to get as much free money as possible
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.340]   So there are four components to the FAFSA form
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.860]   There's the parental income
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.460]   parental assets
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.060]   student income
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:26.100]   Student assets and the idea is once you input all this stuff into the form. It'll spit out an expected
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.540]   parental contribution or
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.900]   EPC the higher the expected parental contribution
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:39.500]   the less free money or the less good financial aid you'll get because the formula is the
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.980]   annual cost of going to college
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:47.960]   Minus the EPC and that difference is the aid you'll get
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:55.060]   Hopefully in terms of good financial aid, but sometimes it's work-study and sometimes it's student loans, but student loans
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.260]   It's not really aid. It's just you know, you got to pay that back. So it's I don't think it counts
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.700]   All right. Now, let's look at each of the four
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:09.580]   Contributing factors to paying for college first is the parental income
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.380]   It's the most heavily assessed at 40% for most families
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:20.060]   so in other words if you make a thousand dollars of income, it'll raise your
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.580]   EFC or EPC by four hundred seventy dollars the more you make
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.260]   The higher your EPC the less money you're gonna have
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:36.420]   So the clear strategy is to earn as little and adjusted gross income as possible
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:42.460]   For two to four years before your child attends college now, that's hard to do if you have a day job
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.300]   It's easier to do if you own a business. It's easier to do if you're a freelancer, right?
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.740]   You just don't work as much
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.380]   however
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.780]   Let's say you're 50 years old and you've been working for 28 years after college yourself
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.960]   And you're kind of burned out and your kid is gonna go to college in two years time
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:07.660]   Well, if you've ever wanted to take a sabbatical if you've ever wanted to retire early or just take a break for two years
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.260]   This is the time to do it to get your adjusted gross income as low as possible
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:19.620]   And once you're in that low marginal tax bracket, you should also do a Roth IRA conversion
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:25.780]   Especially if you're not going to go back to work. All right, the second variable for expected parental contribution are
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.020]   the parents assets parents assets don't count as much as the income only
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.820]   5.64% of parents assets count towards
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:45.100]   The expected family contribution and these assets are assets outside of your tax advantaged
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.380]   retirement accounts in other words
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:55.860]   You can have 3 million 5 million in your 401k or Roth IRA or traditional IRA and that doesn't count
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.860]   towards your FAFSA towards
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:06.700]   EPC so let's discuss what are the assets that don't count when filing for your FAFSA
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.060]   They are retirement accounts such as 401k IRA Roth IRA 403b
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.220]   HSA accounts term life insurance whole life insurance
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.260]   annuities
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.700]   529 plans owned by grandparents a
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.940]   Small business you own so long as you own more than 50% of it and have less than 100 employees a
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.220]   Family farm you live on and operate and your primary
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:41.420]   Residence all of these things don't count towards your FAFSA. Therefore you want to build as much wealth into these
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.980]   assets and
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:50.940]   Less in these assets. Okay. So here are the assets that do count in terms of your FAFSA calculation
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:59.260]   They are your checking and savings accounts all five to nine plans owned by the parents the brokerage and taxable accounts
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.020]   investment property equity
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.600]   second home equity vacation home equity
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:11.620]   vested stock options trust funds your elderly relatives bank account where you are a joint owner
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.700]   cryptocurrencies and
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.640]   UGMA's and UTM a's so you can see how the sooner you understand
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.800]   How to work the college financial aid system or understand how it works in general the easier it is to
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:34.780]   Asset allocate your net worth to look better on the FAFSA application to get free money for college
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:41.420]   And you know the vast majority of families don't do the research. They're not listening to this podcast
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.740]   They're not reading financial samurai. They're not reading books
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:50.820]   They're just kind of winging it and then you know 18 years after their kid is born and they're like, well, wait a minute
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.420]   Why didn't I do this or why did I do that?
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.740]   So thinking is free being strategic is free
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.080]   And this is something I love to do trying to anticipate the future on all the variables
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.340]   And this is why the financial samurai community is so good
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.940]   Because there are plenty of readers who have college age or older kids and they have shared their strategies for getting
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.500]   Free money for college as well in the comment section on financial samurai comm now
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.000]   It's worth talking about the five point six four percent figure
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:27.300]   That's the percentage figure of what counts for assets for parents and the assets that are included in the FAFSA
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.700]   Calculation if you think about that that is so low
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:38.420]   That means the government believes the average American family only saves five point six four percent of their income
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.660]   Over time so that also means that the government can't afford to screw up
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.860]   social security
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.040]   Because if the average person only saves five point six four percent
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.540]   Well by the time they're in their 60s and 70s
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.360]   They probably won't have that much to afford to live comfortably in retirement
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.540]   So that's a positive way to think about it
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:04.540]   The other positive is to understand how low of a savings hurdle there is in America
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.380]   Is really that the average five point six four percent?
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:14.140]   It actually is because if you look at the st. Louis Fred data on the average or median saving rate over time
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:21.780]   It's really in single digits. It's gone as low as like zero to thirty what six percent in March 2020 during the pandemic
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:29.060]   It shows that the average American can save more if we want to however, we choose to yolo it
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.700]   We choose to spend all our money and that's not such a bad thing
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.940]   But it is a bad thing if you end up with too little money in retirement and you got to work at a job
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.740]   That you hate forever, right? So it's pros and cons
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.140]   So it's something to think about as you go about saving and investing
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:49.540]   It's easy. I think to beat the average and if you can beat the average, I think you're gonna have above average
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:57.820]   Lifestyle. All right. Now, let's talk about the third variable for expected parental contribution and that's the student income
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.500]   This is where it gets kind of interesting
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:08.180]   So the government says that 50% of the students income will go towards the FAFSA calculation
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:15.540]   So that's very high 50% I mean the kids are only making what thousands of dollars maybe up to
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.140]   10,000 15,000 dollars as students. I mean, these are the most
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.340]   Industrious students who are making minimum wage. So it is a penalty
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.540]   It's a penalty if the student is making a lot of income
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:34.140]   And so strategically what you want to do is you want to earn let's say the maximum
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.460]   Roth IRA contribution of six thousand five hundred
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:45.940]   Or actually up to the allowance. So the government allows an allowance of sixty eight hundred you can make so whatever you make minus
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:51.740]   6,800 is an amount as an amount and then the government multiplies that by 50%
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:59.900]   To calculate the students expected parental contribution if that's confusing. Let me use an example. Let's say the student makes
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:07.300]   $7,000 working at McDonald's for minimum wage and then the allowance is sixty eight hundred
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:12.100]   Well, the net amount is two hundred dollars two hundred times fifty percent is a hundred dollars
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.340]   That is the students expected contribution
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.620]   So actually that's not a lot at all and if you can earn that money
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:25.840]   the best way to do so with that money is to contribute the maximum to a Roth IRA so it can
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.220]   compound tax-free
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:34.480]   Withdraw tax-free and you didn't have to pay any taxes on it in the first place because the standard deduction is
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:40.020]   13,850 now the final variable to calculate the
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.140]   EPC is the students assets
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:50.660]   students assets basically income minus taxes and spending then you just put in your checking or savings account or
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.780]   taxable brokerage account
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:59.340]   The good thing is I'm assuming most students don't have huge assets because they're students right even if they work side jobs
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:05.940]   They've got the income allowance. They've they want to spend their money and live life as teenagers or college students
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:12.380]   But it's basically 20% of student assets count towards the FAFSA calculation
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:19.780]   EPC contribution and strategically I would encourage all our kids to work hard
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:27.460]   Make up to the income allowance put all that money into a Roth IRA and any income above that
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:34.260]   I would just spend it or you can start a business or you can go travel or buy whatever you want
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.900]   You know that amount of money
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:42.340]   I think it's very valuable to spend now when you don't have a lot of money because you're still saving a lot in your Roth IRA
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:48.940]   Which is great for fundamentals and future growth. Alright, so now, you know the four variables and what to do
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:56.100]   well, what if you are a prodigious saver you've been saving and investing since you are 15 years old and you have
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:03.180]   Way more assets than two hundred thousand per child outside of your retirement accounts
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.300]   What are you gonna do?
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:10.260]   Well, here is what I would do and this is this is for you to try to get free money for college
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.500]   But there's also a cost to it as well
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:19.500]   so the first thing you can do is get all your money outside of your tax advantage retirement accounts and
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.780]   Spend it spend it on life
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:26.860]   one of the things I've been talking about for a while is buying a sweet house in terms of
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.700]   Spending money on a house. You can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a house
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.980]   That's really easy to do is just endless in terms of property
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.420]   Land, so if you want to buy a forever home or a nice house
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.940]   Well, you can probably buy one and spend all that money
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:49.100]   When you're a kid is a freshman sophomore in high school or maybe sooner and that's how you're gonna spend down
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.660]   That taxable brokerage account or your savings or checking money
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:59.100]   The other thing you want to do is spend money on expensive replaceable items such as a new roof
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:05.020]   Or maybe you want to remodel and get a dream kitchen that costs. I don't know fifty to a hundred thousand dollars
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.260]   Maybe you want to remodel every single bathroom in your house, which will cost
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.020]   fifteen to
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:17.580]   $35,000 each maybe you want to do some landscaping all this stuff and then if you like cars
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:24.260]   Well, we know that the average new car price is fifty thousand dollars now, but you know what you're 50 years old
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:29.980]   You know, you've grinded for almost 30 years. It's been tough being a parent saving money investing
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:36.100]   You are in a midlife crisis now, so maybe that Lamborghini or that Ferrari or Bentley?
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.220]   Looks pretty good
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.060]   200 to 500 thousand dollars again our trade-offs you have to consider
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.500]   Are you really gonna spend two hundred thousand or three hundred thousand dollar car to get?
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.540]   Hundred thousand to two hundred thousand and free financial aid
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.780]   Maybe if you've really wanted that car, but of course everybody's different and you got to calculate
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.620]   these expenses to your
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:06.900]   Potential benefits now that we're really daydreaming about how to blow our money to get free financial aid
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:13.660]   I'm thinking maybe a six month around the world trip on a cruise, you know a double cabin
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:20.180]   Ocean view and balcony. I mean imagine for six months gonna see the entire world with your family
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:26.340]   Maybe you I don't know take a gap year or you just I don't know summer vacation at least two and a half three months
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.100]   That experience is probably priceless and that experience might cost
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.020]   Fifty to a hundred thousand per person. Okay, I'm daydreaming here
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:43.900]   but you get the idea the idea is to spend down as much of your cash and your taxable brokerage account money as
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:50.780]   Possible just be careful not to spend so much money that you're left with a liquidity crunch
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.980]   So now you know about the framework for gaming the college financial aid system
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.740]   And I think you can agree that it's really not gaming the system. It's really more about
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.900]   Understanding the system where to move those net worth pieces
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:11.340]   So you look the best possible on the FAFSA if you are someone who is looking to retire early
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.540]   Getting free money for college is going to be difficult
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:22.180]   Because you're trying to build as large as possible your taxable brokerage portfolio and your rental property portfolio
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.820]   And all these other things that can spit out
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.260]   passive investment income so you can leave your job early and
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.580]   survive without having to work or at least until fifty nine and a half or
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:39.940]   When you want to collect Social Security, this means by default you're probably gonna have way more than
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:48.780]   $200,000 per kid because two hundred thousand dollars at a four percent withdrawal rate is only eight thousand dollars and you're not gonna be able
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.980]   to live off
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.020]   $8,000 a year. Let's say the minimum you can live off is
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.460]   $8,000 a year. So with a four percent withdrawal rate you need
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.420]   $750,000 in
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:07.620]   Taxable brokerage account or rental properties or other assets and given I said you can't have much more than
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.540]   $200,000 in assets non retirement assets per kid
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.900]   Well, you better have at least I guess four kids. Otherwise, you're just not gonna get that free money
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:25.420]   So like with so many things in life, there are trade-offs good and bad if you retire early you have more freedom
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.540]   however, you're gonna get penalized when your kids apply for financial aid and
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.300]   That's just the way it is trade-offs. All right
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.580]   Let me leave you with how to really game the college financial aid system
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.860]   According to Michael he has three tips to talk about
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:51.260]   One get divorced on paper and place the children in the home of the parent with little to no income
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:58.100]   Uh-huh to have the child get married which would qualify them as independent from parents
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.460]   So family assets and income aren't counted at all
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.820]   three
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.060]   various self-identifying racial sexual gender characteristics
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.380]   So let's talk about this for a little bit the first idea
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:18.260]   Getting divorced is the most feasible, you know marriage for a lot of people is I don't know
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:24.700]   there's like a marriage tax penalty for a lot of income earners, right if you earn a particularly high income and you
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.220]   Marry another person with a particularly high income
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:33.060]   You're gonna in the past used to pay like five ten fifteen thousand a year and extra
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.100]   Taxes now that went away in about 2017
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:43.140]   So unless your household income is above about five hundred thousand dollars, you're not gonna pay the marriage penalty tax
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.260]   but this strategy of getting divorce on paper is
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:53.700]   It's gonna probably work and divorce is not uncommon. The divorce rate is 40 to 50 percent
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.940]   So let's move on to action point number two
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:05.380]   Have your children get married so the parents income and assets aren't included
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.420]   Well, that's gonna be hard
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:14.460]   Are you really gonna get your 18 year old to marry someone because that's the legal minimum age in many states
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:21.620]   So 18 you get married and then you basically have no income and very little in assets
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.060]   So you're gonna look great on the FAFSA
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.940]   But what you would have to do is probably get married and then I guess wait a year
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.920]   Defer going to college for one year, which is not bad. It's very common in places like Australia
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.900]   It's called like the walkabout where you go travel and explore the same thing in Europe a lot of Europeans after high school
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:45.900]   They just explore the world for a year and see the world mature gain better perspectives
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.340]   So that's not bad
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:54.020]   But come on, are you really gonna force your kid to get married and is your kid really gonna go along with this plan?
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.460]   Mmm, kind of tough. All right
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:56.860]   well
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:03.420]   the final way to really game the financial aid system is to identify as a person who is
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.340]   very much
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.340]   underrepresented whether that's race or
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:14.620]   Sexuality or whatever it is that college or society deems is in need of help
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.620]   There's just one problem with this strategy
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:23.860]   It's hard to change who we are and I believe we should all be proud of who we are at the same time
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:29.340]   we should understand the socio-economic landscape the political landscape and
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:37.700]   See what is going on in terms of who gets a better chance to get in where who gets more money?
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.380]   Who gets more assistance and if you happen to identify as one of those people?
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:49.140]   Well, I think you have a right to identify as one of those people who gets to determine who you are
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:54.380]   Except for you and there's one love for everybody. All right, everybody
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.020]   I hope you enjoyed this episode if you have experience with the FAFSA
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.780]   College financial aid system. I'd love to hear it in a comment in the post shoot me an email
