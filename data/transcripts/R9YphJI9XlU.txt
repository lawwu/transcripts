[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.180]   I'm reading from the Legacy Standard Bible, Psalm 115.
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:19.280]   Not to us, O Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory, because of your lovingkindness,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.400]   because of your truth.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.300]   Why should the nations say, "Where now is their God?"
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.660]   But our God is in the heavens.
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.400]   He does whatever He pleases.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.060]   Their idols are silver and gold, the work of man's hands.
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.520]   They have mouths, but they do not speak.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.060]   They have eyes, but they do not see.
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.500]   They have ears, but they do not hear.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.940]   They have noses, but they do not smell.
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.100]   As for their hands, they do not feel.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.660]   As for their feet, they do not walk.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.500]   They do not make a sound with their throat.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.280]   Those who make them will become like them.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.580]   Everyone who trusts in them.
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.120]   O Israel, trust in Yahweh.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.080]   He is their help and their shield.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.560]   O house of Aaron, trust in Yahweh.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.500]   He is their help and their shield.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.440]   You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.540]   He is their help and their shield.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.620]   Yahweh remembered us.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.620]   He will bless.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.960]   He will bless the house of Israel.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.460]   He will bless the house of Aaron.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.980]   He will bless those who fear Yahweh, the small together with the great.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.860]   May Yahweh give you increase, you and your children.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.580]   May you be blessed of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:03.060]   The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh, but the earth he has given to the sons of man.
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.200]   It is not the dead that praise Yah, and it is none of those who go down to silence.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.580]   But as for us, we will bless Yah from now until forever.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.660]   Praise Yah.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.660]   Praise Yah.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.660]   Praise Yah.
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660]   Praise Yah.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.660]   Praise Yah.
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.660]   Praise Yah.
