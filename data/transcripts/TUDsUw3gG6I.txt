[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   It's guaranteed that if they go into Taiwan, it is a high consequence of that, without a doubt.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.160]   And what the odds are, I don't know.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.440]   However, if you listen to their speeches, they tell you they're going to do it, right?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.320]   They're consistent.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.280]   People read Mein Kampf and said, oh, this is a nutcase.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.240]   No one would ever do that.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.400]   Well, it quite accurately represented, even in dictatorships,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.120]   they have to transmit message to population.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.640]   And they quite often very accurately tell you what they're going to do.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.360]   Putin has been quite clear what he's been up to.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.680]   Stalin was very clear what he was up to.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.800]   So let's judge Xi Jinping at his word.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.320]   And he says he's going to go for it.
