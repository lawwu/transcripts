[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   I'm curious as to what happens or what one should do if their HRV is reduced for maybe
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.720]   three or four or more days in a row.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.720]   Absolutely.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.320]   The next question that I'm going to ask is, "Ian, am I in that adaptation phase?"
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.640]   If so, I'm going to still ignore it just like I did if it was a single bad day, but I'm
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.760]   going to start watching it very carefully.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.140]   I may actually now introduce some other tests, so I may use a performance test, we may look
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.960]   at something else, maybe ask questions, maybe have some communication either with myself
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   or somebody else.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.160]   I'm going to start paying more attention, but I'm still really not going to take much
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.240]   action until that crosses more than seven days of consistent problems.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.000]   If it does do that or we're in a peaking phase, then I'm going to go to another set of solutions
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.320]   that are truly going to pull me out of the hole rather than just be those acute stage
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   shifters.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.200]   These are more what I call chronic stage shifters.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.240]   Now some of these are actually very similar to the ones we've used before.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.960]   For example, thermal stress.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.200]   So I can promise you if your recovery score is in the tanks and you walk outside and you
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.040]   jump in your 35-degree water and you get back out, what's going to happen is your HRV score
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.040]   immediately afterwards, I'm talking within seconds, is going to be significantly compromised.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.280]   In other words, think about that, remember a low HRV means a high sympathetic.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.440]   I promise you cold water will put you in a high sympathetic drive.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:42.000]   However, and we've tested this pretty extensively, looking at HRV zero, 15, 30, 60, 90, all the
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.160]   way up to 180 minutes post.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.900]   And on average, you will see your HRV score continue to rise after that.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.400]   And so while you have this immediate sympathetic response, you will immediately then respond
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.680]   at about 30 minutes on most people, depends on the person though, and that score will
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.640]   be improved for several hours afterwards.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.720]   So heat can kind of have a similar effect.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.000]   That actually, again, is sort of an acute fix, but over time, as we've described earlier,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.360]   that can also have a little bit of a chronic effect.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.860]   We can also then get into areas like sleep.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.040]   And so now we're going to start playing and exploring why are you sleeping poor as well,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.840]   or was your sleep score fine but your HRV was low.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.160]   That's a little bit of a different answer.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.920]   If your sleep is getting compromised, then we're going to start going into and making
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.260]   sure we're improving our sleep.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.440]   In terms of like brain stuff, instead of maybe playing a game or having music or some of
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.200]   those other tricks, those aren't going to really have a chronic effect.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.880]   But you can do things like work on social connection.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.560]   That's actually been shown to improve recovery over time.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.660]   You can do things like journaling or meditation, and those have an acute effect as well as
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.360]   a chronic effect.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.480]   So again, if you go journal right now, you'll probably feel better, but also we know that
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.240]   over time that will gradually improve things.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.580]   So adaptogens and things like that also can have a chronic effect.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.960]   So can things like electrolytes or food or hydration, if those things were off.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.440]   So we're going to go to a whole number of areas, but those are the primary ones.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.920]   Outstanding of all that, of course, it may be simply a time to go back and reassess our
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.640]   training program.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   That's truly the case.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.140]   So that's where we're at.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.360]   If so, we're probably going to either completely remove training or drop it to like 50 percent
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.680]   or so until we start rebounding back to baseline.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.360]   And that's generally the numbers we use.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.840]   For many people who are not training for a competitive sport and maybe aren't pushing
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.040]   themselves really hard, you know, maybe they consider themselves somebody who exercises
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.320]   in order to maintain health and aesthetics and longevity, et cetera.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.100]   And they never really finish any workout completely exhausted.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.520]   They're sleeping okay.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.480]   Their appetite's okay.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.600]   Can we assume that they are recovering well or maybe they're not creating enough of a
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   adaptation response?
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.920]   Like there's no progressive overreaching.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.960]   And so there's really no stimulus for recovery.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.320]   What I'm saying here is on the face of it, I think is obvious, right?
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.200]   If you don't train hard, there's nothing to recover from.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.520]   What I'm really saying is, is the ability to recover itself something that we need to
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.520]   train?
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.160]   In other words, can we get better at recovering?
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.140]   And the analogy here would be something like focus.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.720]   In order to perform work of any kind, but certainly mental work and physical work, we
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.800]   need to be able to focus.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.080]   The ability to focus is the reflection of a bunch of neural circuits and chemicals and
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.160]   hormones, et cetera.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.040]   But we know roughly what those are.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.500]   And we know that if you are poor at focusing, for every small bit of time that you can focus
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.340]   a little bit longer, even if it's a matter of seconds, those circuits themselves get
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.760]   better at focusing and so on and so forth.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.160]   So in other words, is the recovery system, however broad, neurotransmitters, hormones,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.860]   neural, muscular, immune based, et cetera, can that system or set of systems become better?
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.080]   Can we get better at recovering?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.420]   Meaning can it become faster and more effective?
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.380]   Can we think of the recovery system as kind of a blade that gets sharper by engaging recovery?
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.480]   Because if so, then there's strong reason for people who are not pushing really hard
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.200]   to push at least a little bit harder than is comfortable for them every once in a while
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.320]   to make sure that that system doesn't start to slide back.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.240]   Remember, physiology is listening to everything you do and it is always responding.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.920]   So the analogy that I will meet your analogy with that I use here is the bowling alley.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.560]   So you've probably been bowling before and you've used the bumper lanes, right?
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   Bumper lanes.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.680]   I've gone bowling before and I've spent time in the gutter and I've spent time on the pins.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   Okay.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   So it's been a while.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.600]   We used to have a bowling alley in the town where I went to and it was fun.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.240]   We used to slide around on our shoes and all the kids would hang out there.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.000]   I feel like, do they still have bowling alleys?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.160]   I don't even know.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.320]   It feels like something that may have gone the way of the mid-2000s.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.760]   I don't care if no one bowls anymore, you're not going to ruin my good analogy.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   Okay.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.320]   My intent wasn't to ruin your analogy.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   Okay, tell us about bowling.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.560]   All the bowlers are going to come after me with bowling balls or something.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.920]   Right, you're going to get blasted with all the stats on elevations.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   Don't hurt me.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   Sorry.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   Cool.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.200]   So if someone were to go bowling and they didn't want to put their ball in the gutter,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.120]   you could put these little bumpers in those lanes and these little foam pads that go in
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.060]   the gutter that if your ball is going towards the gutter, it hits those and bounces off
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.560]   and goes back in the lane.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   Right?
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   Okay.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.440]   So in this entire conversation, and this is actually true of a lot of the way people approach
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.800]   their fitness and health, people are very concerned oftentimes with optimizing, meaning
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.080]   I want to make sure I don't go in the gutter.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.480]   I don't want to hit the walls.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.800]   So therefore, I'm going to try to improve the accuracy in which I throw the ball.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.240]   So I want to make sure that I'm throwing it down the center of the lane more often and
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.600]   I want to get my standard deviation tighter and tighter so that I don't get anywhere close
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.040]   to hitting the wall.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.120]   However, what they're not realizing is if you do that, the body will start shrinking
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.720]   the size of the lane because what it basically says is, huh, we haven't had a ball touch
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.040]   us in years.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.880]   We don't need to be this wide.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.620]   Let's get smaller and smaller and smaller.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.480]   So it's not that you actually are having a reduced ability to recover, but you start
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.760]   becoming incredibly sensitive to that.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.960]   So your two strategies for enhancing recovery are to practice getting closer, throwing that
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.120]   ball down the middle lane, or to widen, to widen the alley.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.240]   And that's exactly what you're referring to and you absolutely should do that.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.000]   And so what happens is you don't have to be so precise with what you're doing because
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.520]   your ability to handle so many things is widened.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.040]   So if you're off now by four or five inches to the right, no problem because you've just
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.320]   tripled the size of your alley.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.040]   That's exactly what you want to do.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.800]   So paying attention to two things, number one is getting better at accuracy, maybe staying
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.600]   really tight with your progressions, using nutrition and sleep to optimize your recovery
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.200]   and push your resilience is what we call this.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.600]   In fact, there's actually a biological way to measure resilience.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.680]   We do that in all of our folks.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.440]   This is scientifically validated stuff.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.800]   I didn't just make it up.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   You can actually measure resilience.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.120]   And there's more and more coming out on this, but that's exactly what that term means.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.720]   So how well can you handle and bang things off the threshold?
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   So when you see a reduction in say 10% of your HRV today, for you that might make you
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.000]   feel terrible.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.840]   For me, I might not feel anything because I'm well adapted to large fluctuations and
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   therefore I'm okay.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.160]   The less and less you do that, the more and more responsive you will be to those slight
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.160]   deviations.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.280]   So that is exactly the target and that's kind of what I allude to when I say you've got
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.880]   to understand what are we optimizing for.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.960]   Are we optimizing for making sure I don't feel any different today or are we optimizing
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.920]   to make sure when I do feel different, I still am able to perform.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.040]   So this is why you want to do things like maybe use some caffeine today and feel great.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.520]   But if I have to use it every day, all I'm doing is shrinking my sensitivity there.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.960]   So now if I have to go a day without it, I can't train at all.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.160]   Caffeine is the easy example because people understand how that whole system works.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.880]   But this is really true of everything else.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.360]   So yeah, you need to practice this and the way to do that is to give yourself more stress,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.920]   to continue to bring in the stress from nutrition, from training, from breath work.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.640]   You mentioned earlier about focus.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.640]   The exact same thing, right?
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's not just about getting better right now, it's about training a system and you can clearly
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.560]   train that, right?
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.600]   We will often say breath work is a practice.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.160]   That's exactly what we're talking about, right?
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.520]   So you're practicing getting better at these things.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.120]   You're practicing returning your focus.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.040]   You're practicing recovering and quite literally physiologically you can up-regulate whether
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.720]   we're talking enzymes, whether we're talking about regulators.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.440]   These will be up-regulated so then the next time that insult comes in, it's not as damaging.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   So yeah, absolutely you can and you should strive for that.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:53.840]   [Music]
