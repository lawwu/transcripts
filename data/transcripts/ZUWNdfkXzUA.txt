[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:12.720]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.

[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.760]   Today's show is sponsored by Rocket Money.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.240]   I've actually gotten a few questions about my budgeting
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.240]   in recent months because I said I use a spreadsheet.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.640]   And after I said that, Rocket Money reached out.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.280]   I like Rocket Money because they actually
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.680]   find subscriptions you forgot about.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.800]   'Cause I feel like subscriptions
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.720]   are a huge thing these days.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.200]   Where you have a million of them, I do.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.340]   I have one for every single streaming service.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.600]   I have all these subscriptions to financial publications.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.000]   There's probably a couple I'm paying extra for.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.620]   So Rocket Money can actually find if you are doubling up.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.480]   They can cancel a subscription for you.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.400]   Or they can actually negotiate a price
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.160]   if they see a price increase.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.840]   I usually go negotiate on my own behalf
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.920]   for my cable bill.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.200]   I would love it to have Rocket Mortgage do it for me.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.040]   Which is great.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.080]   So it's a personal finance app
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.640]   that just finds and cancels these unwanted subscriptions.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.000]   It monitors your spending.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.200]   Helps you lower your bills.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.040]   It's all in one place.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.200]   So you can go to rocketmoney.com/atc
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.340]   to learn more for budgeting.
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.180]   And people have asked,
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840]   how do I find a good budgeting tool?
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.920]   This is a good one.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.360]   I haven't used a lot of these in my day.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.740]   But I tried Rocket Money and I like it.
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.660]   So rocketmoney.com/atc.
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.500]   - Sounds cool.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.720]   Yeah, I'm just glad that we got rid of the cable packages.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.400]   You know, now I just have 18 payments every month
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.240]   that I have to make.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.480]   - Exactly, you used to have one payment.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.820]   Now that's the thing.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.080]   People don't really know what they're spending.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.280]   This is a way to do it and they can tell you.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.800]   'Cause a lot of those prices have been going up.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.840]   So you can say, oh wait, I signed up for that one
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.800]   'cause I was gonna use it for a month
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.440]   to watch Harry Potter or whatever it is.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   I should have canceled it.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.280]   I didn't.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.100]   It's still there.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.120]   They'll alert you to that.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.960]   - Yep.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.640]   - Do a question. - Good call.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.000]   Okay, up first today.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.400]   We have new question here.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.340]   With the possibility of interest rates dropping in a year or so,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.720]   should a long-term investor looking for reasonable yield
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.800]   and capital gains be looking to buy bonds right now?
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.440]   If so, what would you look at?
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.280]   Thanks.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.240]   - Not a new question in the slightest, I say.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.480]   I think most investors don't really pay much attention
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.300]   to the bond market.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.520]   I think for a long time, they didn't really have to.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.080]   But I think the past few years,
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.520]   the bond market has been way more interesting
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.560]   than the stock market, right?
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.720]   We had a huge bear market last year in bonds.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.440]   Bond yields got to their lowest levels in history in 2020.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.120]   I wrote a few months ago about how T-bills
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.140]   were like the biggest no-brainer investment that there was.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.540]   So John, throw up the first chart here.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.500]   Do a chart on of the yield curve.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.400]   This is as of April, 2023.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.440]   You can see the low end.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.020]   It was three to six months, we're yielding over 5%.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.420]   And then if you go out 10, 20, 30 years,
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.100]   we're talking still well below 4%.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.620]   And so T-bills to me were a no-brainer.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.980]   Like whereas the Fed had been forcing
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.500]   fixed income investors way out on the risk curve
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.580]   since great financial crisis,
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.160]   now investors are being punished for duration
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.420]   in a rising rate environment.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420]   Plus short-term T-bills had a higher yield to boot.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.160]   So you were getting lower volatility
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.080]   and a much higher yield.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.260]   It made a lot of sense.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.980]   And I still think T-bills look pretty darn attractive.
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.860]   You know, since they're still above 5%,
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.580]   pretty much 12 months and below.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.100]   So if the Fed raises rates again, T-bill yields will rise.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.140]   The thing is, the one risk you do have in T-bills
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.380]   is reinvestment risk.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.340]   You can't lock in those 5% T-bill yields
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.060]   for more than a year right now, right?
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.620]   I even looked, I went to Marcus
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.240]   where I have my short-term online savings account.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.300]   I looked at a five-year CD rate there this week.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.140]   What do you think?
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.680]   For five years, how long can you lock it in for a CD, Duncan?
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.940]   - For five years?
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.980]   - Yeah, what kind of yield?
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.180]   - I mean, I would hope that it would be close to Treasuries.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.500]   - That's like 3.8%.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.340]   - Okay.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.520]   - So not bad, but you can't get these five,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.180]   five and a half percent yields and lock them in forever.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.860]   And that's the same thing with T-bills.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.500]   If we have a recession or if inflation keeps falling
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.180]   and the Fed decides to cut rates,
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.580]   eventually those T-bill yields are gonna go down
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.860]   and the reinvestment risk is what gets you there, right?
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.580]   So now look at the updated yield curve, John.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.980]   Let's take a look at it now through this week.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.340]   You can see those T-bill yields are still high
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.180]   and they've gone up a little bit,
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.700]   but the long end of the curve has come up more, right?
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.060]   One, two, three, five, seven, 10, 20, 30 years
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.060]   are all well above 4% now,
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.780]   way better than they were in April.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.940]   That's meant for more pain for the bond world
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.820]   because rates have risen, so prices have fallen.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.740]   But now you can earn, and you still get, again,
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.120]   a premium in the T-bills,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.020]   but I think intermediate-term bonds
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.900]   are looking way more interesting
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.020]   from a combination of higher yields and falling inflation.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.420]   I'm not a bond trader, but let's look at the case
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.940]   for adding some duration here.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.780]   John, throw up my table here.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.940]   So this is a table of the duration
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.300]   and average yield maturities for various bond ETFs.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.300]   So one to three-year treasuries, yielding almost 5%.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.900]   Duration is almost two years.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.500]   Three to seven-year treasuries,
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.220]   little lower average yield maturity,
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.760]   about four years of duration.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.820]   Seven to 10 years is seven years of duration.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.300]   Then the ag, which is like a total bond index,
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.920]   is yielding about 5% at 6.2 years for duration.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.460]   So just as a reminder,
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.180]   duration is just a measure of interest rate sensitivity
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.420]   to bond prices.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.180]   So Duncan, if interest rates rise 1%
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.300]   and you have a duration of five years,
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.480]   your bond prices will go down 5%.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.820]   - Right. - And the inverse is true.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.020]   If rates fall 1%, your bond prices go up 5%.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.980]   Now the thing is, when bond yields were 1%
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.300]   and rates went up 1%,
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.740]   you got dinged 5% for that duration,
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.140]   but your 1% yield barely gave you any cushion.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.580]   Now, if you have a 5% yield,
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.620]   in a year, you're breaking even.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.140]   So yes, it would sting if bond rates went up from here
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.300]   'cause the economy accelerated
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.540]   or the Fed kept raising rates or inflation stays high,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.140]   but you have a much bigger margin of safety now
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.260]   in these intermediate-term bonds.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.020]   And oh, by the way, if your rates rise 1% from here,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.380]   now we're talking about 6% starting yields.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.180]   So I think now that yields are higher,
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.340]   the break-even and margin of safety is much bigger,
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.940]   so bonds could have some short-term downside,
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.940]   but 90% to 95% of expected returns five and 10 years out
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.180]   for intermediate-term bonds comes from the starting yield.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.500]   Whatever the starting yield is,
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.800]   plus or minus a little bit of wiggle room,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.500]   that's gonna tell you your future return.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.940]   So expected returns are way higher
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.540]   'cause we went through the pain of 2022
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.500]   in the bond bear market.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.340]   So I actually think that you're in a much better place now,
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.780]   and if you want to hedge for recession risk
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.680]   or deflation risk or rates falling in the Fed cutting,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.940]   intermediate-term bonds look pretty good.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.780]   Another positive development is tip seal.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.700]   John, throw this up there.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.740]   This is Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.420]   This is the 10-year.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.340]   I was taught early in my career,
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.380]   anything in the 2% to 3% yield range for these,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.540]   this is nominal yields, is a good development.
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.740]   And what this means is you're getting that yield
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.780]   plus the inflation kicker.
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.620]   So that's a pretty good deal.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.020]   You can see in 2020, 2021, and 2022,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.900]   it was negative nominal yields,
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.480]   meaning you were accepting yields that were less than 0%.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.880]   All you were hoping for was inflation there.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.720]   And those bonds got killed 'cause rates rose too.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   So I guess my thinking here is I don't pretend
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.840]   to have the ability to predict where rates are gonna go,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.600]   but I don't think you need to bank on capital appreciation
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.880]   for bonds to do well here.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.040]   If rates just stayed where they were at 4% or 5%,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.880]   you're doing way better than you were
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.720]   over the last 15 to 20 years.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.840]   So I think you have some options.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   If you're worried about rising rates or inflation,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.080]   T-bill yields are still nice,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.500]   and if rates rise more, they will rise too.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.580]   If you're worried about deflation or recession
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.140]   or falling rates, intermediate-term bonds look good.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.740]   You could go way out on the risk curve
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.820]   and do 20 or 30-year bonds,
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.020]   but that's too much volatility for my liking.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.700]   And then if you're worried about purchasing power,
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.060]   you have TIPS, where you have yield
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.460]   plus the inflation kicker.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.060]   So I don't know.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.500]   I think if you're diversified in a fixed income space,
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.300]   your options haven't been better in, I don't know,
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.040]   20 years or so in this space.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.880]   So I think you're pretty good.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   And you don't have to have yields fall to do well here.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.300]   You just have to have rates stay where they are,
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.060]   and you're gonna be fine and clip those 5% coupons.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   - I used to buy that junk, JNK, I think was the ETF,
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.540]   because it had such a nice, juicy yield.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.380]   What is that at these days, you think?
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.460]   - So that's 7% or 8%, I guess, something like that.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.100]   But then you take away any default risk.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.220]   We're talking mostly treasuries here.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.300]   The ag is like 40% or 50% treasuries,
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.740]   so that's not all treasuries.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.500]   They don't have any junk bonds in there.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.960]   But based on your tolerance for risk,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.280]   that doesn't really surprise me
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.720]   that you're into junk bonds.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.180]   That's more like equity risk, though,
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.460]   when the excrement hits the fan.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.600]   But yeah, no, I think you're in a much better position
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.100]   for fixed income in terms of having options now
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.660]   than you did before.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.660]   - Right.
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.960]   Also, rest in peace, IBONs.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.800]   Haven't heard anything about those in a long time.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.980]   - Yeah, that was fun for like nine months.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.820]   - Yeah.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.900]   - Remember how many questions we got about that?
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.220]   - I know, that was like weekly.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.060]   Every week we had IBON questions.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.900]   - Now nothing.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.060]   - Yep.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.060]   So yeah, that was Roger.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.480]   Up next, we have a question from David.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.220]   First off, thank you for all that you do
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.440]   and all the insightful content you put out.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.500]   I'm 24 years old and have managed to save up
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.900]   roughly $135,000.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.660]   Half in a high-yield savings account
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.500]   and half in--
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.320]   - Nailed it, Duncan.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.260]   - Roth accounts.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.100]   Yep.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.580]   I don't have any equity buildup in a house,
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.380]   nor do I have a 401(k).
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.460]   I'll be taking the Series 65 and CFP later this year
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.380]   and will hopefully land a job with a 401(k) in benefits.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.580]   Did I ultimately screw myself by not having
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.540]   a 401(k) earlier or am I okay for now?
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.620]   This is a 24-year-old.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.460]   - Yeah.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.460]   - Asking if it's too late.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.420]   - Yeah, you're doing just fine.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.660]   Obviously, like the personal finance gurus
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.580]   have got to this person, to David.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.980]   My first job, I worked in the industry,
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.140]   I was there for three years or so.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.400]   My salary was buckus.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.820]   I didn't make anything.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.340]   There was no 401(k) plan.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.340]   I had no dental insurance.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.020]   I had health insurance, but it was bare bones.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.880]   And, I mean, I just got out of college, so let's be honest.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.560]   I didn't go to the doctor, right?
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.400]   Never.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.440]   Who goes to the doctor when they get out of college?
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.860]   Unless something's really wrong.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.880]   Even then. - Still.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.420]   - So it was a small business.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.240]   There was five of us.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.320]   There was one main guy and there was four younger people
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.900]   who were just kind of learning.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.940]   And I learned a ton on that job,
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.780]   so it was definitely worth it.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.240]   It was more about learning than earning for me, right?
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.800]   So I learned a ton of stuff that I still use to this day
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.740]   about asset allocation and investing guidelines
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.940]   and client communications and setting expectations.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.900]   It was great.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.940]   But I didn't have a 401(k)
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.940]   for the first three years of my career.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.460]   And I had no 401(k)s.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.300]   I think I mentioned this before.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.980]   I opened up an IRA, target date fund, obviously,
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.420]   and put $50 a month into it.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.520]   That's all I could afford.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.140]   As my career progressed, I started to make more income.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.460]   I slowly but surely increased that.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.840]   I got a 401(k) for my second job.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.540]   I started putting money into that.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.060]   I know we have a lot of super savers
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.300]   who write into the show, especially young people
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.660]   in their 20s and 30s, like I'm maxing out my 401(k),
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.780]   my IRA, my HSA, 529 for my unborn child,
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.600]   whatever it is.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.800]   We have a lot of these super savers who write in.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.640]   I applaud those people.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.900]   You're so far ahead of the game.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.040]   You're money and you didn't even know it, right?
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.500]   I just turned 42 this month.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.500]   I don't think I started maxing out my 401(k)
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.780]   till my early to mid 30s, right?
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.620]   Seems late.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.440]   Like, Ben, how could you?
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.660]   What is wrong with you?
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.780]   Like I said, I didn't make a lot of money early in my career.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.620]   So I've been playing catch up
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.540]   for the last eight or nine years, pretty much.
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.260]   And life got in the way so many times.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.380]   Saving for a house, paying for home renovation.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.300]   I've mentioned before, my wife and I had infertility issues
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.680]   that cost a lot of money.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.300]   All that stuff held back our retirement savings.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.420]   So I couldn't, you know, I got close,
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.420]   but I never, I couldn't really do it.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.380]   I think I was maybe 33 or 34
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.860]   by the time I could finally max out.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.780]   And guess what?
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.620]   I don't worry about it.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.460]   It's fine.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.280]   It happens.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.120]   Life gets in the way.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.860]   This person, David, you're still 24.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.460]   Yes, saving early and often can help you
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.620]   in terms of like compounding,
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.740]   but you're certainly not screwed.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.580]   You've managed to save six figures already
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.420]   in these other accounts before you're able to rent a car.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.260]   That's pretty good.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.100]   That's still 25, right?
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.140]   For renting a car?
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.960]   - I think so.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.380]   I was about to make that joke, actually.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.220]   It never made sense to me.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.900]   I don't get it.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.920]   The 25 thing.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.580]   People are living longer than ever these days.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.060]   So young people in their twenties,
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.800]   you have many, many decades ahead of you.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.640]   I don't know.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.460]   Once you get that 401k,
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.300]   you can start funneling money in there.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.500]   But I mean, if you have an IRA and a brokerage
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.400]   or a high yield savings account, you're fine.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.260]   I mean, you obviously have developed some pretty good habits
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.820]   by putting that money away already.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.980]   And the fact that you're worrying about this stuff
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.460]   at age 24 means either way,
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.540]   you're probably going to be fine.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.260]   So no, the 401k isn't like the be all end all.
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.340]   - David's probably depressing
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.020]   a lot of our younger audience watching right now.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.860]   Because yeah, it sounds like he's doing pretty well.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.800]   - We had Nick Majulian probably over a year ago
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.340]   talking about how you shouldn't max out your 401k.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.180]   And just keeping your money
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.820]   in a brokerage account with index funds
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.180]   gets you to pretty much the same place anyway.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.380]   So I think you'll be fine.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.340]   Once you get one, you can always put one in there,
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.020]   get your tax deferral or whatever.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.580]   Bill Sweet would probably tell you to get a Roth 401k
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.500]   if you have the option.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.840]   But no, you're fine.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.680]   Don't worry about it.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.660]   You'll have plenty of time.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.820]   - And series 65, that's like,
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.980]   that's something trading related or?
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.180]   - Yeah, so you can sell securities.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.660]   So he's somehow going to sell securities,
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.580]   working in the finance world.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.700]   He's going to be fine.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.680]   - Gotcha.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.500]   - All right, next question.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.420]   - Hey, up next we have a question from Micah.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.660]   I'm in my late 20s, single, no kids,
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.420]   rent an apartment and hold a stable
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.380]   federal government job, knock on wood.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.500]   I keep the lower end of the three to six months
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.560]   of emergency fund because of the stability of my job.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.880]   And I have access to $60,000 in a taxable brokerage account
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.000]   that God forbid I would ever have to use.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.040]   Am I crazy for only holding an emergency fund
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.560]   of three months?
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.900]   - All right.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.240]   All these people in their 20s so worried.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.520]   I never really looked at anything in my 20s, right?
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.600]   - Not a care in the world.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.000]   I've never really agreed with the whole
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.280]   personal finance trope of you have to have 12 months
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.600]   of savings in your emergency fund
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.080]   before you can move on to saving for this.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   And like, I don't know, especially when you're young,
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.940]   it's basically impossible to save that much.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.580]   I don't know how many people actually have the ability
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.900]   to save that much without just living on bread and water
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.940]   and not doing anything ever.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.100]   Plus the good news is at Micah's stage in life,
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.660]   you have so few responsibilities.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.060]   Let's look at your situation.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.140]   I think emergency fund levels should be circumstantial
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.300]   to the responsibilities you have.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.380]   So he holds a stable government job.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.980]   I know people who work for the federal government.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.940]   It's basically impossible to get fired.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.260]   I heard a story one time about someone actually
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.340]   literally bringing a gun in on accident
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.000]   and leaving it in the bathroom counter
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.080]   and they did not get fired.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.920]   They worked for the federal government.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   - Hate when that happens.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.500]   - Right?
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.480]   No kids, no mortgage, no spouse.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   Why do you need 12 months in emergency savings?
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.700]   Plus you have three months, it sounds like,
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.080]   and you have this contingency plan
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.600]   of a $60,000 brokerage account
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.960]   to break in case of a true emergency.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.000]   Plus if you're a single person,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.920]   altering your life is so much easier.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.760]   Like if something really does hit the fan here
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.200]   in your finances, your job, something ever does go wrong,
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.160]   you can cut back mercilessly in your lifestyle
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.000]   as a single person.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.760]   That's much harder to do when you have responsibilities
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.660]   in your 30s and 40s, when you have a mortgage
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.640]   or a family or someone else to support.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.320]   So I'd be more worried about taking trips
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.040]   and enjoying yourself in your 20s,
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.480]   doing stuff that you're not gonna be able to do
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.400]   when you have those responsibilities in your 30s and 40s.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.860]   So it sounds to me like he's already a good saver.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.360]   You know, you don't need the fortress balance sheet
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.720]   like Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.960]   When you're in this situation, you're single
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.800]   and you have all this stuff
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.640]   and you already have saved money.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.960]   As long as you have the backup plan,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.300]   12 months is overkill.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.600]   Three months to me is fine.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.760]   I would say worry more about enjoying yourselves.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.080]   And I don't know.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.160]   All these people in their 20s are so worried.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.720]   - Does Dave Ramsey talk about having really--
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.760]   - A lot of personal finance people think
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.680]   this is a rule of thumb.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.280]   And again, I think it's circumstantial.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.500]   - To be clear, I'm not knocking.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.760]   It definitely makes more sense
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.160]   than not having any emergency savings.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.800]   But yeah, it sounds like it could get a little--
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   - And again, it also depends on your other backup,
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.240]   plan B, plan C, plan D, in terms of I have this other money
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.440]   or whatever I can tap.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.280]   - I don't think you need to do it
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.080]   just because you have to hit the checkbox
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.720]   because some personal finance guru said you had to do it.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.560]   - Right.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.440]   - Doesn't make sense to me.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.280]   You're fine.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.840]   - And you're a personal finance guru.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.880]   So you said that now.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.720]   So that counters wherever they heard this.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.680]   - That's a Trump card.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.560]   I'm on YouTube, so it has to matter.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.660]   - It's true.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.140]   - All right, one more.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.980]   Next question.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.900]   - Up next, we have a question from Scott.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.240]   I'm in my, wait.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.560]   Yeah, that's the same one I was about to say.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.480]   The next time you have Jonathan Novy on the show,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.280]   can you have him go into further detail
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.200]   about long-term care insurance?
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.480]   My wife and I are in our 50s
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.080]   and each have a family history with medical issues.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   How do we determine if long-term care
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.040]   makes sense for our financial plan?
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.800]   - All right, we go from 20s to 50s here.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.640]   - Spoiler alert, who's on the show?
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.640]   - Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.300]   If someone gets called out by name,
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.140]   we'll bring them on the show.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.240]   Jonathan Novy, one of our advisors in insurance,
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.920]   expert extraordinaire at Rithold's.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.080]   - Hey guys.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.960]   - Jonathan, I'm honestly not too familiar
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.800]   with this type of insurance
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.920]   'cause I haven't had to use it before.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.160]   So why don't you just start with the basics,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.300]   like what is it, how does it work,
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.480]   and like when should you think about getting it?
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.640]   - Okay, so there's a really big backstory
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.920]   with long-term care insurance
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.320]   and how the insurance industry got it really wrong
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.480]   and how they built policies.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.800]   Suffice to say that no one's caffeinated enough
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.200]   listening now to actually sit through the entire story.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.260]   So I'll cut to what's happening now.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.720]   The industry looks nothing like it did many years ago.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.760]   And there are almost no, what's known as standalone,
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   long-term care policies available anymore.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.140]   By standalone, what I mean is you pay a premium
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.340]   and then eventually if you make a claim, great,
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.360]   they'll pay it for you, or the money goes away.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.280]   A lot like homeowner's insurance or something like that.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.120]   So there's only a very, very small number
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.160]   of standalone carriers left.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.760]   The carriers that used to sell this kind of insurance,
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.600]   whether it be Genworth or John Hancock
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.920]   or Metropolitan Life, they're all out of the business.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.440]   And all they're doing is choking
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.040]   on these existing books of businesses
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.620]   they are struggling to pay for.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.880]   - Is that because, 'cause I've seen the health studies
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.640]   before that show the percentage of spending for healthcare
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.980]   in your later years before you die,
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.040]   that's like the majority of the money gets spent then.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.880]   Is that why?
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.240]   Was it just too expensive?
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.920]   - So that's one of the three reasons
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.160]   that insurance companies got the pricing wrong.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.080]   The cost of care absolutely exploded.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.360]   It also has to do with the fact that nobody lapses
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.520]   long-term care insurance.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.880]   I mean, anecdotally, if anyone has a history
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.440]   in their family where someone made a claim
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.320]   on long-term care, it's terrible.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.840]   People live for a very long time.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.780]   The care is unbelievably expensive.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.520]   So nobody lapses long-term care like they typically do
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.280]   with things like permanent life insurance.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.760]   - What exactly does it, if you have it,
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.880]   what exactly does it get you?
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.240]   It gets you the ability to pay--
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.400]   - So it's a very good question.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.080]   All long-term care insurance contracts have built into them
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.760]   that if an insured cannot satisfy two of the activities
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.440]   of daily living, whether that's feeding yourself
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.440]   or traveling or taking medication or bathing yourself
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.440]   or something like that, if a doctor says you cannot satisfy
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.040]   two activities of daily living, then you can make a claim
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.600]   on a long-term care policy.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.200]   And they will pay for, some will pay for in-home care,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.440]   some will pay for care in facilities.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.940]   There's all these different bells and whistles
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.180]   on the contracts.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.280]   Suffice to say that generally speaking,
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.000]   when you can't satisfy two activities of daily living,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.800]   you can make a claim on a policy.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.700]   And there's like 90-day elimination periods
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.520]   or 180-day elimination periods.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.640]   But we can get rid of all of the kind of small details there.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.040]   If you can't take care of yourself anymore,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.920]   then you can make a claim on a policy.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.240]   - When I'm no longer able to tweet,
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.960]   that's the ring the bell for?
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.880]   - Yes.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.140]   Yeah, that actually may count in disability
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.160]   more than long-term care.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.660]   So at your age, so this is a really good question.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.120]   So this guy's, you're in your fifties
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.580]   who asked the question here,
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.240]   asking what is a good time for you to look into it?
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.640]   - Well, that's what I was gonna ask is,
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.560]   so like life insurance, if you buy it when you're younger,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.840]   obviously it's way cheaper.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.060]   Does the same thing apply here?
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.120]   If you buy it in your fifties as opposed to your sixties
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.240]   or maybe your seventies, it has to be cheaper, right?
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.400]   Does that make sense or not?
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.000]   - Well, a little bit.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.220]   So the thing about long-term care is
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.320]   with some of the new contracts available,
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.520]   these what's known as asset-based contracts,
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.400]   people can't buy it before they reach 50 or 55
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.680]   'cause carriers won't sell it to them
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.800]   because then what they have to do
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.760]   is accommodate a rising benefit, an inflated benefit,
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.600]   and it's more risk for the insurance carrier.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.900]   So some of these you can't buy when you're young.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.000]   Other kinds of contracts you can.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.020]   Most of what you can buy now is a life insurance chassis
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.660]   with a long-term care rider or capability attached to it.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.640]   So when you think about what the right time is to buy it,
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.200]   most importantly, it should be grounded
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.420]   in your financial plan.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.080]   Most people like Ben, you, like me, I'm in my early fifties,
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.320]   I'm busy paying term insurance premiums.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.000]   I'm busy paying for disability insurance
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.360]   because the bigger risk right now to my family
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.840]   is that I die or I'm disabled and I'm saving for college.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.740]   And I'm doing all of that stuff.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.320]   And once I have all of those things paid for,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.600]   if there's any money left over,
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.960]   then I'm probably gonna be investing it in something else.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.760]   So long-term care comes in when all of a sudden
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.800]   you probably don't need to pay
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.520]   for disability insurance anymore
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.680]   or term insurance isn't necessarily a thing
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.880]   because people buy insurance
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.560]   'cause there will be a financial impact on their family
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.200]   in the event they were to die
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.640]   or in the event they were to need long-term care.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.720]   There's a time when it fits
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.840]   into your individual financial plan.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.440]   And that's what somebody should pay attention to
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.400]   is when it becomes reasonable for them to think about,
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.720]   one, how they can afford it
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.480]   and two, when it fits into their plan.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.200]   Now, the older you get, obviously the more expensive it is.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   So fifties is actually a reasonable time to look at it.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.740]   But I wanna point out one other thing in this question.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.640]   With a family history of cognitive issues,
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.360]   insurance carriers, many of them
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.360]   will underwrite those issues
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.040]   and limit an individual's ability to be insured
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.440]   based on a family history of cognitive issues,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.480]   whether it be dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease,
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.680]   stuff like that.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.240]   - So how do you do the cost benefit on this then?
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.320]   'Cause at a certain point, you'd have to say,
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.080]   well, if they're gonna jack the rates on me
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.000]   because I have a family history,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.700]   is it better for me to just set aside some money
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.000]   as opposed to buying the insurance?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.460]   - It might be.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.000]   It might not be.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   With insurance, if you make a claim,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   you can point out that once you've paid your premiums,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   how long it will take you to have made your money back
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.280]   or how long it will take you for it to have been worth it.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.480]   Now, there's other thing that goes along
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.080]   with long-term care insurance.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.820]   All carriers provide care coordination services.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.800]   So what that means is if all of a sudden,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.240]   let's say one of our parents or something needs care.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.120]   Most people, when they need some sort of custodial care,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.920]   they have absolutely no idea who to call or what to do.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.560]   It's like, yeah, there's like a nursing home in town
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.840]   or something like that.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.360]   Or do you go to your doctor and say, all of a sudden,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.720]   I need someone to come in here and care for my mom
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.080]   or my dad because they can't care for themselves anymore?
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.920]   - That's what happens a lot.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.440]   It usually falls on the family, right?
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.840]   The family has to take care of people, right?
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.360]   - Right, but nobody knows what to do.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.160]   And families need to bring in professionals to do this.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   So insurance contracts come
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.100]   with care coordination services.
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.200]   I'm not saying that this is the best coordination
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.400]   in the world, but at least it's something.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.600]   And at least it's links to services that are available
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.840]   to help you understand it.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.480]   In addition to that, there are a couple kind of bits
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.600]   of information that you can get free on the internet
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.560]   to understand this.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.000]   There's two places if you want to learn
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   about long-term care that you would check.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.840]   One of them is--
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.680]   - You're answering my next question.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.840]   Like what do people start if they want to learn about this?
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.360]   - So go to your state insurance commissioner
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.800]   or state department of insurance.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.480]   Just use the Google machine and look up long-term care.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.640]   There's a lot of good information on things
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.080]   like your state partnership program.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.920]   That's a thing.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.240]   It has to do with Medicaid.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.120]   You want to look at state partnership programs.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.100]   You want to look at the possible deductibility of premiums.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.400]   All this stuff will exist on your state website.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.520]   In addition to that, the NAIC,
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.920]   which is the National Association
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.400]   of Insurance Commissioners,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.100]   publishes a really informative pamphlet.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:38.940]   There it is.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.140]   The Shopper's Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.700]   I would say have a very big coffee before you read it,
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.560]   but there's very good information in that thing.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.480]   And that's the good place to start.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.600]   - So I think the reason someone wants to learn this,
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.480]   someone in the comments says that their mom's nursing home
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.840]   was $7,500 a month.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.580]   So like this stuff is crazy expensive, obviously.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:05.480]   - At 7,500 a month, I'd say you're getting a bargain.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.320]   It is so expensive.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.060]   - Do our viewers in Canada not have to worry about this?
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:10.900]   We have a big audience there.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.380]   - I'm sure we have viewers in Canada and Europe
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.760]   who say like, you Americans are crazy.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.080]   This is like a discussion for another time.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.160]   But like, why do you have to worry about this even?
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.320]   Obviously that's a whole bigger policy question, but.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.200]   - So regarding that policy question,
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   the state of Washington was last year or the year before,
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.760]   actually it mandated that citizens own
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.080]   a state sponsored long-term care insurance policy.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.160]   It's not a very big one.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.640]   And they're paying for it through a payroll tax,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.840]   a 0.58% payroll tax.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.040]   There are two other states right now
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.660]   that are considering doing that.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.980]   I think it's New York and California.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.200]   There are ways to opt out of that insurance contract
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.720]   if you can prove that you want a policy yourself.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.540]   But this is a thing now legislatively,
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.760]   and people are recognizing that the cost of care
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.680]   is unbelievably high.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.440]   - Especially with people living longer.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.600]   And we have all these 70 million baby boomers
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.520]   and like, that's a...
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.200]   Around my house with like a five mile radius,
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.600]   I swear I've seen six old folks homes go up
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.880]   in the last 10 years or so.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.560]   Like they know the wave of people is coming.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.400]   - You can't believe the cost to do things
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.240]   like reserve beds in there.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.940]   The costs continue to go up.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.880]   And as a result, like insurance carriers
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.120]   for existing policies and things like that,
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.740]   they're raising premiums on policies
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.120]   that have been enforced for years.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.160]   And anecdotally, my mom and dad own a contract
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.320]   where the cost of it has doubled
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.360]   to maintain the same benefits that they had
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.040]   when they started.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.400]   - Okay, we'll include a link to that.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.480]   Some stuff on the YouTube, but good stuff.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.900]   I honestly didn't know much about this.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.440]   So let's do another one, Duncan.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.760]   - Okay.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.440]   Last but not least, we have a question from Alan.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.160]   And Alan says, "I see a lot of annuity companies
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.500]   "offering 5% plus for five years.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.120]   "Got one for 5.2% right now.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   "These are selling like hotcakes all over advisor land.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.960]   "Why do you think annuity companies can go out five years
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.980]   "at these rates while banks are all stuck
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.940]   "offering 12-month CDs?
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.300]   "Do insurance companies know something
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.520]   "about the future interest rates?
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.700]   "I'd like to hear your thoughts on how they can profitably
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.760]   "offer these competitive rates for so long
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.580]   "and pay me a commission."
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.540]   - Okay, this gets back to our first question, right?
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.700]   I said, you can't lock in T-bill yields right now.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.700]   Whereas annuity salesmen say, uh-uh, yes I can.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.880]   So I guess part of it is the pooling of assets, right?
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.360]   - So there's the pooling of assets.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.780]   Now that applies to what I believe
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.900]   is a different kind of annuity
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.540]   than he's talking about in this question.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.420]   So there's lots of annuities out there.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.780]   - Also, before we get into this,
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.720]   I'm actually surprised that these things
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.560]   are selling like hotcakes
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.580]   because you can get decent yields and bonds.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.780]   - Right, that surprised me, reading that.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.780]   - I guess people just love the certainty
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.820]   of having something locked in.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.420]   - Yes, people love certainty.
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.660]   So that's something with annuities.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.100]   I have no idea if they're selling like hotcakes or not.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.260]   I guess that depends where you are
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.140]   and what your incentives are to sell them.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.180]   I guess we can get into that a little more in a minute,
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.280]   but there's a lot of different kinds of annuities out there
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.640]   from this kind that he's talking about,
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.360]   which is just a simple fixed annuity.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.740]   We can get into things like variable annuities
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.220]   and QLAX and SPIAs and all of that nonsense later
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.060]   if anybody wants to.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:20.060]   But in this specific case, a simple fixed annuity,
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.260]   the reason, and it's a term of time, let's say five years,
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.620]   the reason an insurance company
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.940]   can pay a little bit more than a bank
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.940]   is because an insurance company
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.740]   can invest its general account slightly more aggressively
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.980]   than a bank can with its reserves.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.640]   So an insurance company can do more
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.760]   than just own like government bonds and some mortgages.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.520]   They can own corporate bond portfolios.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.120]   They can own some, I believe, some small equities.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.440]   They can not have to worry about the same need
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.060]   for liquidity that banks do.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.920]   So because of that,
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.100]   if you're going slightly out on the risk ladder
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.640]   and you can match some liabilities,
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.120]   like it used to be,
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.400]   and this points to a question you had earlier in the show,
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.900]   used to be that yields that were further out
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.980]   were higher than yields that were closer in.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.200]   - They should be, yeah.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   - Right, they should be.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.240]   So if you have a longer time horizon,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.560]   typically insurance carriers can match the liability
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.160]   to something that's a longer date.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.640]   And as long as there are decent credits
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.520]   in what they're owning,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.440]   you can just offer a better yield.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.640]   Now, there are trade-offs with everything.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.320]   At the end of a fixed annuity,
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.640]   you're gonna pay income tax
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.960]   on like all of the yield in there.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.000]   It just is the way it is.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.200]   That's the way an annuity is set up.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.160]   So.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.020]   - Plus there's a liquidity issue.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.120]   There's the built-in fees.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.960]   There's a lot of this.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.780]   So like if you wanted that money before the term is up,
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.620]   there's gonna be a penalty.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.940]   - You're gonna pay a hefty surrender.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.760]   You're gonna pay a really hefty surrender.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.600]   - So that's part of it too,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.120]   'cause if it's a five-year annuity,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.240]   you're giving up that liquidity.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.500]   And that's one of the reasons, too,
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.480]   that they can pay a higher yield
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.000]   because they know they don't have to pay you back
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.600]   in 12 months if you want the money.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.760]   Otherwise, you have to pay a fee
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.600]   and your yield goes down, obviously.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.120]   - So it's essentially, it's a contract.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.240]   You're signing a contract.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.160]   And to get out of it, you have to pay to break the contract.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.480]   - Yeah, it's a contract with an insurance company.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.720]   And to be fair,
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.040]   granted, you wouldn't be that worried
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.600]   about a reputable insurance carrier paying you back,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.280]   but there is slightly more risk to an annuity
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.960]   than there is a CD, because a CD is FDIC insured.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.880]   - Right, you have the counterparty risk.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.680]   I think the one thing we've learned today
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.880]   from you, Jonathan, is that insurance products
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.680]   are complicated, right?
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.360]   I think we-- - So they can be.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.300]   They can be very complicated.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.040]   There's, again, there's another discussion
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.520]   about annuities to be had here
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.040]   that we can get into if you guys want to.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.120]   - Something I'd mentioned to you off the show, Jonathan,
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.200]   is with defined outcome ETFs,
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.560]   which everyone's been talking about so much lately.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.680]   Yeah, I mean, what role really do these products play?
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.480]   Do annuities play?
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.440]   - Okay, so defined outcome ETFs are different
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.600]   than annuities that give you guaranteed income.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.000]   I think defined outcome ETFs are great
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.340]   because people hate uncertainty.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.600]   And it's the hating of uncertainty
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.560]   that is the reason, generally speaking,
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.000]   that people buy annuities.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.520]   But annuities give you guarantees.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.960]   Now, there's gonna be a lot of discussion
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.680]   about whether those guarantees are worth it,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.840]   but that's not a financial plan discussion.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.360]   That's an individual discussion.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.200]   That's a planning-as-key discussion.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.340]   - Right, so some people simply can't handle the risk
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.800]   of having a diversified portfolio
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.960]   and seeing it go down in value
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.800]   or seeing it go up and be volatile,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.360]   and they just want something like this
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   that just gives them money
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.280]   and tell me how much money I'm gonna get.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.560]   And obviously, it doesn't have to be all or nothing,
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.600]   but I think that's the idea.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.680]   Some people just don't want to have that uncertainty.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.000]   - Right, and there's a lot of research out there,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.440]   whether it be from Wade Pfau or Michael Kitsis,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.720]   that say that people with guaranteed income,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.340]   meaning annuities,
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.760]   they tend to spend more in their retirement
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.600]   than people who don't have guaranteed income.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.760]   And they intend to have a much more
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.320]   kind of psychologically comfortable retirement
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.560]   like spending path.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.600]   - Which is another topic that's come up on this show a lot,
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.600]   is people who have all this money
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.000]   and they can't force themselves to spend it.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.640]   So an annuity, you're right,
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.800]   it gives you a stream of income.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.960]   Even if it's a bad deal and it makes you spend more,
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.640]   for some people, maybe that psychological hurdle
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.760]   is worth it.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.240]   - Right, and generally, annuities do have
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.640]   a terrible reputation, they're well-deserved.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.440]   'Cause the problem with annuities,
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.400]   like I've said before on here,
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.300]   it's not the contracts themselves,
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.880]   it's the people who are incentivized to sell them.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.120]   - Right.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.400]   - They come with big commissions.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.960]   So anytime you have an incentive structure
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.840]   built in like that, there's gonna be a loser.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.800]   And it's typically the person who's buying the thing
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.400]   with the high commission.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.560]   - Right, and maybe that's what the person
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.720]   asking this question should think about,
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.760]   is like, is this a product that's right
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.120]   for some people in some situations?
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.520]   Yes, but is it right for every person
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.360]   in every situation?
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.400]   Of course not.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.240]   - You're absolutely right.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.120]   - That's the way you have to approach it.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:52.960]   - Yep.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.000]   - Yeah, all right, that makes sense.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.100]   Good stuff, Jonathan.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.840]   All right, thanks for joining us, as always.
