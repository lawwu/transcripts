[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300]   We apologize for the echo that's evident throughout this recording of a message by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.700]   This, unfortunately, was due to problems when the original recording was made and is beyond our control.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.400]   We hope, however, that it will not spoil your enjoyment of this sermon by the Doctor.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:34.900]   I say how privileged I am to be asked to deliver this Jubilee Sermon on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches.
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900]   I'm very happy to do this for many reasons.
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.900]   I mustn't spend too much time on this, but I had the privilege of knowing the Rev. E.J. Poole-Connor,
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:51.900]   who was so instrumental in bringing this Fellowship into being. I had the privilege of knowing him very intimately over a number of years,
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:03.900]   and I always rejoiced in my association with him, and particularly, perhaps, in connection with the Evangelical Library.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   But for many other reasons also, I am glad to be here,
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.900]   and I would like to apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused to the authorities of the Fellowship
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.900]   and to any others present here tonight for this new arrangement,
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.900]   which has had to be made, unfortunately, in the order of the services last night and tonight.
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.900]   But, men and women, we are in the hands of God, and however much we may plan and propose,
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.900]   God is over all, and we never know what a day may bring forth.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:47.900]   But we thank him for his grace, which is sufficient for every eventuality and occasion.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:55.900]   Now, I'd like to call your attention this evening to the message of that chapter which my friend Mr. Fitch has read to us,
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.900]   namely the sixth chapter in the book of Deuteronomy, and in particular the twenty-third verse.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:17.900]   "And he brought us out from them that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers."
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.900]   I felt while I was contemplating the message for this occasion that nothing perhaps could be more appropriate
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:36.900]   than that we should look at this occasion which we are celebrating in the light of the teaching of this particular chapter.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.900]   For here we are reminded of a message delivered to the children of Israel
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.900]   after their exodus from the captivity and the bondage of Egypt,
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.900]   and just as they were about to enter into the promised land of Canaan.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.900]   Here, it seems to me, we have a message that is not only appropriate to the occasion,
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.900]   but one which is very sorely and very sadly needed at this present time.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   I was tempted once to deal this evening with the differences and the similarities
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.900]   between the conditions obtaining fifty years ago and those of today,
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.900]   but I deemed that it would not be profitable merely to do that, though it is very interesting.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.900]   I would sum it up by putting it like this, that I believe that once more we in our age and generation at this time
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:42.900]   are being called upon to fight the same battle as our fathers fought and others in the early twenties.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.900]   Some of us had thought at that time and a little later that the great fight for the scriptures perhaps had been fought and won.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.900]   The war, the First World War, had shattered the facile optimism of the liberal theologians
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.900]   and we thought we had heard the end of most of it, but unfortunately it has come back and is coming back like a flood.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.900]   So never was it more important for us to consider the whole situation in which we find ourselves
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:24.900]   and particularly what the history of this fellowship has to say to us in that connection and in that respect.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:35.900]   Now it seems to me that the whole history of God's dealing with the human race
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   is nothing but a series of happenings comparable to what we read of in this chapter.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:54.900]   God bringing us out always from some bondage. This has been the story of mankind, hasn't it?
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:05.900]   Man, because of his folly and because of his sin, is constantly getting himself into a condition of bondage in various ways.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:14.900]   And the whole message of the Bible is the history of God in his infinite mercy and kindness and compassion,
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.900]   delivering his people, bringing them out from some bondage, setting them in liberty.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.900]   That is, of course, the great and the central message of salvation.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.900]   And that is the thing in which we delight who are believers of the gospel.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.900]   But that's what it comes to. Man in fetters and in chains, the shackles of sin and evil.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.900]   And there he would have remained, and would remain, and all of us would remain in that condition,
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.900]   were it not, I say, that God comes in and sets his people free.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.900]   But that is not only the story of the human race in general.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.900]   It is also, unfortunately, the story of God's own people in particular.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.900]   From the moment that you find God forming a people unto himself in the Old Testament,
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:23.900]   through the call of Abram and so on, you tend to find that this was the checkered history of the children of Israel.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:31.900]   Though they were God's people, they were constantly getting into a condition of bondage and of serfdom.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.900]   It happened repeatedly to them. And that would have been the end of the story,
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:48.900]   were it not that God had intervened and had called them forth, drawn them out, and set them again at liberty.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.900]   Now, the first great example of that, of course, is the one which is dealt with here in the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.900]   The bondage and the captivity in Egypt.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.900]   And there they would have perished, were it not that God raised up a man who led them out
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.900]   and brought them again to their own land and to liberty.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.900]   There were many other examples of this in the times of the judges.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   It constantly happened to them in exactly the same way.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.900]   Then the Assyrians came down upon them.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.900]   And then the Chaldeans, captivity of Babylon.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:35.900]   That seems to be a kind of epitome of the whole story of God's people in the Old Testament.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.900]   It's a series of exoduses.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:46.900]   God bringing his people out again from a bondage and under some terrible tyranny.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.900]   This is a most astonishing thing.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:58.900]   And then when you come to consider the Christian Church, subsequent to the canon of the Scriptures,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:05.900]   unfortunately you find that the history of the Church has been very similar.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:11.900]   The Church has always had a tendency to go into bondage, to some kind of serfdom.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.900]   And what are the glorious mountain peaks in Church history?
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.900]   Well, they're all of them the history of some kind of exodus.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.900]   What's the Protestant Reformation but a repetition of this?
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.900]   God setting his people free.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:33.900]   Calling them out of what Martin Luther called the Babylonian captivity of the Church.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.900]   Out of the Egyptian darkness of Roman Catholicism.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.900]   And setting them at liberty.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.900]   That's what happened at the Reformation.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.900]   But that didn't happen once and for all, they got back into trouble again.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   And the whole story of Puritanism is but a repetition of this.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.900]   These men were crying for liberty, further liberty, complete liberty.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.900]   Feeling that it was inadequate, as it had happened in the Church of England.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.900]   So that's another kind of exodus.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:13.900]   People going out of the Church of England in the name of freedom and of liberty.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.900]   Anxious to have this emancipation.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:25.900]   And that, as you know, I needn't tell you, is the real inner history of the great story of the Pilgrim Fathers.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.900]   Those men who eventually went and settled in America had first gone out of this country.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.900]   Because of this desire for freedom and for liberty.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.900]   First to Holland and then from Holland, as you remember, to America.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.900]   The story of the Pilgrim Fathers is just another repetition of the exodus.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:49.900]   It was all in terms of this kind of freedom for the people of God.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:57.900]   And then you get exactly the same thing, as you know, in the evangelical awakening of the 18th century.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:03.900]   And how these bodies of people who met together in classes, first of all within the Church of England,
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:12.900]   found it was inevitable, if they were to have true, full freedom of worship, that they should go out and separate.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:20.900]   And they felt that they were brought out by God and formed their various bodies.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:27.900]   So you see, the whole history of the Christian Church of England has been a series of exoduses.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:35.900]   God calling out his people, separating them, setting them at liberty.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.900]   Now the question that arises at once, of course, for us is this.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:47.900]   Why is it that God's people get into this condition?
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:56.900]   How does it ever come to pass that they should be in this sort of bondage, this servitude, this serfdom?
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   And this to me is the most interesting and important point.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.900]   It never happens suddenly.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.900]   It didn't in biblical times, it hasn't happened in subsequent times.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.900]   It's always a gradual and a most insidious process.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:21.900]   Indeed we can go further and say this, and this is one of the great lessons it seems to me we've got to learn at the present time.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   The Church has generally found herself in bondage, because of the abuse of something which was in and of itself quite good.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:46.900]   How often has it happened, has it happened here to the children of Israel when they found themselves under the whips and the harshness of their taskmasters in Egypt?
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.900]   How did they ever get into this position?
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.900]   Well you remember the answer, you know the story.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.900]   They went down to Egypt because of the famine that had arisen.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.900]   The famine was more or less universal.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.900]   But God, you remember, had made provision through Joseph.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.900]   And so these people had gone down to Egypt to buy food.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.900]   And the result was that they'd all gone down there and they'd lived there.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.900]   There was nothing wrong in that.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.900]   It was God's own provision that there was corn in Egypt.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:23.900]   So the going down into Egypt was not bad in any sense, it was good.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:30.900]   But it was that, you see, which was meant to be a temporary measure and a temporary expedient,
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.900]   which ultimately led to the serfdom and to the captivity.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:42.900]   And so often you will find in biblical history and in subsequent history that it has been something analogous to that,
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.900]   that has eventually brought the Church into this condition of servitude.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.900]   Some condition had arisen, something had to be done.
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:56.900]   Perhaps a committee was set up or some enactment was made which was excellent as a temporary measure.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:02.900]   But alas, temporary measures have a tendency to become permanent.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:10.900]   It is always more difficult to repeal an act of Parliament than it is to pass the original act.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:17.900]   And so it has generally been the case that God's people have got into this condition
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:24.900]   because of something that was right in and of itself, but which became abused.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.900]   You know, the great example of that in many ways is what happened to the brazen serpent.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.900]   You remember how when the people were being bitten by serpents and were dying,
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.900]   God told Moses to make this brazen serpent and put it up on a pole
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.900]   and to teach the people that anybody who looked at it would be healed.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.900]   And so they were, excellent.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   But you know, a day came when that became an idol and God had to command them to destroy the brazen serpent.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.900]   That's the kind of thing to which I am referring.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:04.900]   But I take it that the ultimate cause of why God's people so often find themselves in a condition of bondage is this.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.900]   It is because they're God's people.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:13.900]   And because they're God's people, they bring upon themselves the hatred
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.900]   and the persecution of those who are opposed to God.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   Our Lord has prepared us for this.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.900]   He says, "The servant is not greater than his Lord."
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:29.900]   He said, "If they've done this to me, how much more are they going to say to you, to do it to you?"
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.900]   And it is very largely because they are the people of God.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.900]   That was the trouble with these poor Israelites.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.900]   That's why they were treated in this way.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.900]   They were God's people, and they were blessed of God, and they were successful.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:48.900]   That made the Egyptians jealous of them, and then made them hate them, and then made them persecute them, and so on.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.900]   So the ultimate cause of this is the very fact that we are God's people
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.900]   means that we are the targets of the devil, the evil one,
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:03.900]   who is not so much concerned about us as that he should ruin God's work
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.900]   as he tried to do with the original creation,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:12.900]   and that he might bring the gospel into disrepute.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.900]   Well, very well. There, then, it seems to me,
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:22.900]   are the main causes of why this should ever happen to the people of God,
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.900]   why it is that we have this miserable story.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:32.900]   For it is a miserable story that the people of God are so constantly in captivity
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:39.900]   and need, in some way or another, to be led and to be brought forth.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:45.900]   Now, the next matter, it seems to me, that we must consider is this.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   The type of bondage, the manifestations of this bondage
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.900]   into which God's people so constantly have fallen.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.900]   What are the forms which it takes?
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.900]   I believe it's very important that we should remind ourselves of these at this present time.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:15.900]   For I believe that what happened on this occasion so long ago is the position of so many today.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.900]   And there are many of God's people who live up and down this land and other lands
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.900]   and are in trouble and don't know quite what to do.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:28.900]   They're suffering, they're complaining under these terrible goadings and so on
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.900]   of those who are against them, and they don't know what to do.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.900]   So it's important we should consider the forms,
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.900]   the ways in which this kind of bondage manifests itself.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.900]   The first, of course, and the greatest, I'm looking at the thing historically tonight,
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:52.900]   the first and the greatest tyranny of all was the tyranny of Roman Catholicism.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:58.900]   This was endured by God's people through so many long centuries.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:05.900]   All that is conveyed by the terms "priesthood" and "papalism"
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.900]   and all the other manifestations of that terrible tyranny
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.900]   in which the people of God were not allowed to read their Bibles,
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.900]   not allowed to meet together to pray and to consider these matters,
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.900]   but were kept in a condition of gross darkness.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:33.900]   This great worldly church claiming civic power as well as spiritual power
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.900]   and dominating over the lives of the people.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.900]   I hope that you're familiar with the history.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.900]   In days and times like these, when men and women are being enticed
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.900]   not only to look back to Rome but to go back to Rome,
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.900]   it is surely wise for us to read something of the history of the past.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.900]   For Rome has not changed a single doctrine,
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:05.900]   and Rome is still Rome in spite of the new face that she may put on,
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.900]   as we've been reminded by Dr. La Cueva.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.900]   Well, now there is one great illustration of it,
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.900]   but unfortunately that's not the only way in which this kind of tyranny
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.900]   or of bondage has manifested itself in the past.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:28.900]   Another way is this, what I would call ecclesiasticism,
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:34.900]   or if you prefer it in another word, denominationalism.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   What is this? Well, you read the history of the church
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.900]   and you find that there is a perpetual tendency constantly in the church
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.900]   to allow forms of government and systems of government
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.900]   to tyrannize over the people.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.900]   I remember reading a book many years ago,
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.900]   must be over 40 years by now I'm afraid,
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.900]   which had the most suggestive title,
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:07.900]   "Religions of Authority and Religions of the Spirit,"
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.900]   and it's a most excellent title.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.900]   It's a wonderful summary of the whole of church history.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.900]   There has been a constant battle in the life of the people of God,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.900]   Old Testament and New, and particularly in the Christian church,
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.900]   a conflict between these two elements, religions of authority,
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.900]   where the institution becomes important,
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.900]   where the particular form of government becomes important,
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.900]   over and against the freedom of the Spirit.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.900]   There's been a constant tension here.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.900]   Now this is something that is almost inevitable.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.900]   You see, you must have form as well as substance.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.900]   You must have a minimum, an irreducible minimum,
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.900]   of order and of government.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.900]   We read of all that in the New Testament itself.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.900]   The need arose almost immediately in the early church.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.900]   You get the appointment of deacons in Acts 6 for that reason.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.900]   The church cannot continue to exist without a modicum of order
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.900]   and of system and of government.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.900]   But the danger is that that becomes so exaggerated
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.900]   that it militates against the Spirit.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.900]   And this is something that one can see so clearly
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.900]   as one looks at the long story of the history of the Christian church.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.900]   How not only bishops as well as popes,
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.900]   but also sometimes presbyters.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.900]   You remember it was Milton who said that the new presbyter
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.900]   was very similar, just another name for the old priest.
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.900]   The tendency for men and for officials to become more important
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.900]   and for the structure of the church and the government of the church
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.900]   and the ordering of the church,
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.900]   not only to militate against the life of the Spirit,
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.900]   but more or less to quench the life of the Spirit.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.900]   That's very common and has happened many, many times.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.900]   But again, I haven't exhausted the list.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.900]   There have been other factors that have led to this sort of
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.900]   tyranny and of bondage.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.900]   Sometimes a kind of intellectualism has come in.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.900]   It is right that we should have confessions of faith.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   It is right that we should define our faith.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.900]   The very fact that heresies begin to be taught
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.900]   means that the church has got to define truth over against heresy.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.900]   That's why the early church, under the guidance of the Spirit,
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.900]   met together in their great councils and drew up their various creeds,
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.900]   like the Apostles' Creed, Athanasian Creed, Nicene Creed, and so on.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.900]   But there is a danger constantly that men of a certain legalistic type of mind
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:50.900]   become over-precise and define beyond the teaching of the Scripture,
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.900]   and it can become a bondage and a tyranny.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.900]   They legislate for the people of God
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.900]   in a manner that the New Testament itself doesn't do.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:07.900]   And frequently this kind of bigotry has been a severe kind of tyranny
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.900]   which has been exercised over the spiritual life and the thinking
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.900]   and the worship of many of God's people.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.900]   That's another manifestation.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.900]   And then another has been worldliness in the church.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.900]   Now if you think of what happened 200 years ago,
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.900]   at the time of the evangelical awakening,
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.900]   the real trouble with the church at that time was that she was worldly.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.900]   I know she was more or less indifferent to her doctrine,
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.900]   but the main trouble was worldliness.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.900]   You weren't worldly parsons, you weren't worldly church members.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.900]   And the result was that when people under the preaching of Whitefield
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.900]   and the Wesleys and others received a living spiritual experience
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.900]   and wanted to worship in that way,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.900]   they were persecuted by the others.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.900]   They found themselves in fetters.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.900]   They were persecuted in a physical manner as well as in a spiritual manner.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.900]   And there was a great conflict as between the institution
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.900]   and the liberty and the freedom of the Spirit.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:14.900]   Worldliness in the church always persecutes the true Christians.
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:20.900]   There have been so many examples of this in the long story of the church.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.900]   But you know I sometimes think, and this is I think particularly true today,
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:31.900]   that perhaps the most powerful form of tyranny and of bondage
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:38.900]   under which God's true people have suffered has been traditionalism.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.900]   What do I mean by traditionalism? Well, I mean something like this,
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.900]   that people are governed not so much by their understanding or by their experience,
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.900]   but by what has always been done.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.900]   Now I've had to hear a great deal of this during the last 40 years or so,
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.900]   and I'm constantly hearing about it from my brethren in the ministry at the present time.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.900]   Men who themselves are anxious for liberty and for freedom
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   are finding it difficult to persuade their people to follow them.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.900]   And I say, "Well, what's the trouble? What is their argument?"
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.900]   They say, "They have no arguments except this,
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.900]   that we were brought up in this church.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   This is the denomination that I've always known.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.900]   This is how I've always done things."
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.900]   And you see, it's something with which you can't reason.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.900]   It's not intelligent.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:35.900]   It's the sheer weight of habit and of custom, a dead traditionalism.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.900]   And it is one of the greatest forms of tyranny.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.900]   As I say, irrational, but nevertheless very powerful.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.900]   And so God's people have been subjected to these various forms of tyranny
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.900]   and are still being subjected to them at the present time.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:58.900]   It's all but the modern form of what happened to these poor children of Israel down in Egypt,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.900]   having to build more and more bricks with insufficient straw,
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.900]   the whips and the lashes of the taskmasters.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.900]   How has all this been applied in church history?
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   How is it being applied so often today?
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:20.900]   Well, many of these brethren here tonight know something about the tyranny of sustentation funds.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.900]   They know what it is to have the financial screw put upon them
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.900]   if they persist in preaching as they do,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.900]   or if they persist in trying to enlighten their people
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.900]   with regard to the doctrine of the church and of church government.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:41.900]   They know the tyranny of committees and of presbyteries and of bishops.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.900]   And it can be a very powerful tyranny.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.900]   I've known excellent men in the ministry
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:52.900]   who, because they belonged to denominations which could control the movement of ministers,
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:59.900]   were never given a charge or a church anywhere approximating to London.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:06.900]   They were generally sent to the wilds of Wales or the north of Scotland or to Cornwall.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.900]   And it was seen too by the authorities that such men
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.900]   were never to receive a call to what is regarded as an important or a city church.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.900]   This is sheer persecution.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:25.900]   This is nothing but the old taskmasters of Egypt with their whips and their lashes.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.900]   And I say this to the honor of so many brethren who are here tonight
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   who've endured this kind of tyranny and of serfdom and of bondage in the past
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.900]   and who have borne it so menfully.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.900]   Well now there are some of the kinds and the types and the forms of this bondage
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:51.900]   and this tyranny which one can see when one looks through the pages of church history.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.900]   What is to happen to us?
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.900]   What hope is there for the true people of God?
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.900]   They're there, they're in captivity, they're in bondage.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.900]   What happens?
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.900]   The answer has always been that God has intervened.
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.900]   He brought us forth.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.900]   And he's always done it.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.900]   And he's done it because the church is his.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.900]   It isn't the church of men, it's the church of God.
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:23.900]   I haven't the time tonight to go into the ways in which God has done this.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.900]   Sometimes he's done it as he did it on this occasion with the children of Israel.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.900]   He's raised up one man like Moses
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.900]   and has given him the truth and the vision.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.900]   Oh Moses, look how he suffered.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.900]   Look at these miserable children of Israel.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.900]   The time it took him to convince them,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.900]   their readiness to complain and to grumble and to go back.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.900]   And Moses has to keep on almost in desperation.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.900]   The one man, as it were, standing alone.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.900]   Now very often it has been like that.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.900]   But it isn't always like that.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.900]   God has disturbed the people,
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.900]   opened their eyes to the bondage under which they're living,
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.900]   made them realize that they're in a system which is alien to their own genius
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.900]   and their being as his people and as true Christians.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   And in various ways, he has thus disturbed them,
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.900]   roused them, and they've had a leader and they've followed.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.900]   Here again is something which is so wonderful, I must advert to it very briefly.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.900]   Look at the series of leaders you get mentioned in the Bible, in the scriptures.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.900]   But look at the great leaders subsequent to that.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.900]   I've already referred to Martin Luther.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.900]   It was just this very thing.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.900]   There were the people of God in this Egyptian darkness,
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.900]   the Babylonian captivity of the church.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.900]   And God disturbed his men and opened his eyes.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.900]   At first it was his own personal concern about his own justification, as you know.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.900]   And he objected to the indulgences.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.900]   But on and on he went reading the scriptures.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   And as he did so, he saw so clearly that the whole system was wrong
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   and that the people were being denied the truth.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   They knew more about saints than they did about the biblical characters.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.900]   They knew more about Mary than they did about her son.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:19.900]   And he began to denounce this church and to open the eyes of the people.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.900]   And they were awakened and they followed him out.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.900]   John Calvin did something similar.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.900]   And then in Scotland, at the same time, you have that great man John Knox.
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.900]   This happens to be the 400th anniversary of the death of John Knox.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.900]   And some of us are going to have the privilege of celebrating that here in London,
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.900]   later on in the year, and in Edinburgh.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.900]   But that man did exactly the same.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.900]   The people in Scotland were in utter darkness in a spiritual sense.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   God raised his men and he thundered his message.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.900]   And he opened the eyes of the people.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.900]   And they were led out of the Church of Rome.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.900]   And they were led to the liberty of the gospel,
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.900]   which is so well known and which has played such a vital part
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.900]   in the whole history of that great nation and that great people.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.900]   Well, all I could go mentioning are the great and notable names,
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.900]   the great men of the 18th century.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.900]   These are all, as it were, a kind of Moses chosen by God
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.900]   to open the eyes of the people and to lead them out.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.900]   And you come to the last century, and you've got to mention Charles Haddon Spurgeon.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.900]   He saw this very thing.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.900]   It's the whole meaning of the downgrade movement.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.900]   And he did his utmost to enlighten the people and to lead them out
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.900]   from the tyranny which had come in.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:47.900]   And in this connection, I'm happy to say that I wouldn't hesitate to include,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.900]   as being worthy to be put into the list, the name of E.J. Poole Connor.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   He was in the same tradition as he shows so clearly in his own book,
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.900]   Evangelicalism in England.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.900]   Well, now, those are the ways in which God brings his people out.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.900]   But let me ask the most important question.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   Why does he do this?
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.900]   Why did God bring them out?
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.900]   Why did God bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.900]   Why didn't he let them stay there and bless them, as it were?
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.900]   Why did he take them through the Red Sea and so on?
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:31.900]   And the first answer is that Egypt is no place for God's people.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   God's people are meant to be free people.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.900]   God's people are meant to worship him in the way that he has appointed,
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:46.900]   and not in the way that some human potentates may chance to decide.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.900]   It's because they're God's people,
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.900]   and because without liberty and without freedom, they cannot truly worship.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   You see, this is the great story of Protestantism
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.900]   and the free churches particularly in our own country.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.900]   All these men who came out in the 16th and the 17th and the 18th centuries,
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.900]   they all came out for exactly the same reason.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.900]   They felt they were not being given liberty to worship God
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.900]   as they wanted to worship him.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:21.900]   They felt that they were being killed by formalism,
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.900]   by ceremonies, by ritual,
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.900]   by the whole structure of the church.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   And their spirits were crying out for liberty.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.900]   They wanted to pray. They were not allowed to pray.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.900]   They wanted to study the scriptures. They were not allowed to do so.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:43.900]   So you see, they came to the realization, and how important and how vital this is,
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.900]   that with a mixed multitude you have no freedom.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.900]   If you're involved with people who deny essential aspects of the truth,
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.900]   if you're in a mixed denomination
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.900]   where some deny the very being of God and others the deity of Christ,
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.900]   and most of the cardinal articles of the Christian faith,
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.900]   how can you enjoy freedom in worship?
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   How can you pray with a man who denies the deity of the Lord?
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.900]   I say it's impossible. It just cannot be done.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.900]   Or how can you be free in your worship and in your conduct of your Christian life
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.900]   if you're always having to consider that if you say something you may be offending
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.900]   a brother minister in the same denomination or something of that kind?
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.900]   How can you be free when you're always having to accommodate
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:33.900]   and always having to be wary lest you may cause some offense?
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.900]   My dear friends, these things are impossible.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.900]   There is the conflict between the institution and the spirit,
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.900]   between the letter and the spirit.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.900]   And it is because God wants his people to be free,
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.900]   as the apostle Paul puts it in that ringing phrase
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.900]   at the beginning of chapter 5 of the epistle to the Galatians,
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.900]   "Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty."
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:08.900]   And the call of the gospel is always a great call to liberty.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.900]   God's people have no right to remain in Egypt.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.900]   They have no right to remain in any Babylon.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.900]   They may have comfort,
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.900]   but their business, I say, is not to belong there,
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:28.900]   to come out and to enjoy the liberty wherewith Christ has set them free.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.900]   So the first thing that has to happen to people in this condition
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.900]   is that they have to come forth.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.900]   And God, in these various ways, as I say, does that.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.900]   He brought us out from this.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:46.900]   And we've got to come out from every form of tyranny and of serfdom.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.900]   We are entitled to worship God freely.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.900]   The freedom of the spirit is the supreme thing in connection with worship.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.900]   And we must get rid of every latent hindrance and restraint,
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.900]   whether it be theological or ecclesiastical or whatever else it may tend to be,
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   that militates against this vital, fundamental, and central freedom.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:13.900]   So God, in various ways, brings us out from this.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   That's the first reason.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.900]   But now let me emphasize the second.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.900]   Why does he bring us out?
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.900]   Why did he bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.900]   Was it simply to leave them in the wilderness?
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.900]   Was that the object?
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.900]   Was it mere physical absence from Egypt?
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.900]   Is that all?
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.900]   And you see, the answer is quite plain.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.900]   He brought us out from thence that, in order that,
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:53.900]   he might bring us in to give us the land which he swore unto our father.
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:59.900]   Now here is the thing that I would leave in your minds above everything else.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:05.900]   Mere separation from wrong is not sufficient for the people of God.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.900]   I say you start with separation.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.900]   You must separate from all bodies, whatever they may be,
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.900]   and however long their traditions, however venerable their histories.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:23.900]   We must separate from all bodies that allow men in the name of Christ to deny Christ.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:29.900]   We must separate from all forms of sacerdotalism and priestcraft,
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.900]   and all that is merely formal in connection with the worship of God.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.900]   We must separate from all that.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.900]   But I say with equal emphasis and stress,
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:47.900]   that only and merely to separate from that is not enough.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.900]   God doesn't bring us out merely to bring us out.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.900]   He doesn't bring us out to leave us in the wilderness.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.900]   The children of Israel had to spend some time in the wilderness.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.900]   It was their own fault.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.900]   It was because of their sinfulness.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.900]   God didn't bring them out of Egypt to bring them to the wilderness.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.900]   He brought them out of Egypt to take them into Canaan.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.900]   And here is something I think that many of us need to be reminded of at the present time.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:19.900]   It's not enough that you be clear about separation from heresy,
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:23.900]   unspiritual character and life in a church,
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.900]   and all these other things to which I've made reference.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   It's not enough to separate.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.900]   We are not called out of Egypt to enter into the cave of Adullam.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   The Christian people who are called out to the mixed denominations
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.900]   are not to become just little sectaries,
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.900]   just little coteries of people,
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.900]   who pride themselves in saying that they don't belong to that.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.900]   They mustn't belong to that. They're right there.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.900]   But merely not to belong to that doesn't put you right.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.900]   It's only the first step.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:02.900]   He brought us out from them, that, in order that he might bring us in.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.900]   God's work is always positive,
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.900]   and his purposes are always positive.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.900]   Where does he want to bring us?
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.900]   Are our churches that have left the mixed denominations
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.900]   to be almost identical with those others,
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.900]   with the one difference that we don't belong to them?
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   Are the people of God to look like the Egyptians and these others,
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.900]   the only difference being that we're no longer actually in Egypt?
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.900]   I say that that is an insult to the name of God.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.900]   No, no. We're to be entirely different.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.900]   It isn't merely coming out of Egypt, it's entering into Canaan.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.900]   This is God's great and grand purpose.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.900]   So let us examine ourselves, my friends,
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.900]   and let's be certain of this.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.900]   Don't merely stop priding yourself that you've left what is wrong.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.900]   The great question I would ask and I would leave with this assembly is this.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.900]   Have you entered into Canaan?
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.900]   Why did God bring you out?
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.900]   Well, he tells us here in verses 10 and 11.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.900]   "And it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.900]   which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abram, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:25.900]   to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not,
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   and houses full of all good things which thou fillest not,
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.900]   and welds digged which thou diggest not,
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.900]   vineyards and olive trees which thou plantest not,
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.900]   when thou shalt have eaten and be full."
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.900]   That's what God's purpose is.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.900]   Not merely to bring us out and leave us in misery
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.900]   as little groups of people in a wilderness.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.900]   No, no, it's Canaan.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.900]   Houses, cities, wells which we haven't dug,
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.900]   a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.900]   This is what God's people are to be.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.900]   This is where God wants us to come.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.900]   This is where he's leading us.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.900]   And until we know that we've arrived in this Canaan,
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.900]   my dear friends, we're in a thoroughly defective position.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.900]   What does it mean?
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:20.900]   What does he mean by these houses and these cities and these wells
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.900]   and the land flowing with milk and honey?
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.900]   Well, in a spiritual sense, I would interpret it like this.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.900]   Why must we separate from heresy and heterodoxy?
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.900]   Why must we have nothing to do with denominations
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.900]   that allow people to deny the cardinal articles of the Christian faith?
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.900]   Why?
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:46.900]   The answer is this, that we may have the full enjoyment of this glorious gospel.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.900]   We are called, I say, deliberately.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.900]   What did our Lord say?
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.900]   He'd come to give his people.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.900]   I am come that they might have life
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.900]   and that they might have it more abundantly.
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   You say, "We've left the dead churches.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.900]   We've left the dead denominations."
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.900]   All right, my friend, I'm glad.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.900]   But tell me, have you got a live church?
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.900]   Are you alive yourself?
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.900]   Have you got this life more abundantly?
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.900]   It's because that's impossible in captivity and bondage that God brings us in.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.900]   He puts us into his own land,
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.900]   the land that he's promised to Abram and to Isaac and Jacob,
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.900]   the land that he's prepared for his people.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.900]   And true evangelical churches are not to give the same impression
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.900]   or to have the same aspect, the same appearance
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:41.900]   as dead churches in dead denominations.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   There is to be an essential difference.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.900]   We are not to be negative.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.900]   We are meant to be positive.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.900]   What are we meant to show?
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.900]   We are meant to have assurance of salvation.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:58.900]   Cities to dwell in, houses to sit down in and enjoy ourselves.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.900]   We've arrived. It's all prepared for us. Assurance.
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.900]   This is the great need of the hour.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.900]   The world is in trouble. It doesn't know what to believe.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.900]   It's ready to clutch at anything that passes by,
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.900]   any theory, any movement, anything.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.900]   People are bankrupt and they want certainty.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.900]   And this is the great task of the Christian church at a time like this,
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.900]   to give certainty to people,
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.900]   certainty and assurance of salvation.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.900]   These other people in the dead denominations,
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   they have no assurance of salvation.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.900]   They can't have it. They don't believe the truth.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.900]   But it's a terrible thing if we, who claim to be the people of God,
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.900]   are equally uncertain as they.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.900]   This is what they come to us and they say.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.900]   They say, "You've left us. You've separated from us.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.900]   But are you different? Are your churches different?"
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.900]   They say, "We don't see much difference.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.900]   You seem to be exactly as we are,
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.900]   except that you no longer belong to us."
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.900]   And if that is true, God have mercy upon us.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.900]   We are meant to dwell in Canaan, my friends.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:01.900]   We are meant to have assurance of salvation.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.900]   Yes, and we are meant to drink of these wells.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.900]   We are meant to have full satisfaction.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.900]   We are meant to be representatives before the whole world
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.900]   of that which our Lord said, do you remember,
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.900]   to the woman of Samaria,
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.900]   "Whosoever drinketh of this water,
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.900]   the water that belongs to men and the world,
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.900]   the man-made wells,
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.900]   the teaching of these false doctrines
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.900]   and the dead denominations,
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.900]   whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again."
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:34.900]   And they do.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   That's why they have to keep on changing their theologies.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.900]   They're always having to move to some new philosophy,
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.900]   some new idea, some new stunt,
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   because they haven't got truth.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.900]   And they can't find satisfaction or give it to others.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.900]   But that's not the position of the people of God.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:53.900]   "But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.900]   shall never, no, never thirst again.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.900]   But the water that I shall give him
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.900]   shall be in him a well of water
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.900]   spraying up into everlasting life."
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.900]   Our churches, my friends, are to represent that.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.900]   The wells which we haven't digged,
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.900]   the Son of God has digged them for us
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.900]   at the cost of His life.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.900]   And here is an endless supply
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.900]   bubbling up into everlasting life.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.900]   And everything else that is included under the words
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.900]   "milk and honey,"
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.900]   there is no justification for separation
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.900]   from the dead denominations
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.900]   unless we show people that we've entered the land
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.900]   that is flowing with milk and honey,
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:46.900]   full enjoyment, full enjoyment.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.900]   Read the great history of the past.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   This is what happened at the Reformation.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.900]   There was no enjoyment under Roman Catholicism.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.900]   They denounced the doctrine of assurance of salvation.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.900]   You had to go and confess your sins to the priest.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.900]   You had to pray to the saints.
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.900]   People had to light candles when you were dead
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.900]   and pay indulgences for your soul.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.900]   The whole thing was uncertain.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.900]   There was no enjoyment,
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.900]   and there was no true singing either.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.900]   But when the Reformation came, they began to sing again.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.900]   The songs of liberty.
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.900]   Read about the early church.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   See the lyrical pictures in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.900]   What was the great characteristic of those people?
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.900]   They met in one another's houses daily.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   They hadn't got church buildings then,
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.900]   but they met in one another's houses.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.900]   And what did they do?
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.900]   They ate their bread with gladness,
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   with rejoicing of heart,
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.900]   praising God.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.900]   They were a praising people.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.900]   So were the early people of the Reformation.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.900]   Read the history of the Methodists of the 18th century.
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.900]   When these great hymns came flowing in flight,
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.900]   well, they were taking of the milk and the honey.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.900]   They had full satisfaction,
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.900]   full enjoyment,
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   the great freedom of the gospel.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.900]   And they began to sing and they prayed together,
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.900]   and they were enjoying their new life in Christ Jesus.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.900]   That's the ultimate object in bringing us out of Egypt,
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.900]   that we may enter into the land
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.900]   flowing with milk and honey.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.900]   Well, let me therefore close on this note.
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:35.900]   Which is emphasized perhaps chiefly in this sixth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:41.900]   The warnings that were given to these people.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.900]   "You've been brought out.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.900]   Be careful,"
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.900]   says the message of God through his servant.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.900]   "Be careful.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.900]   I've brought you out.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:52.900]   I've given you liberty.
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.900]   You haven't done it.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.900]   I've done it for you.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.900]   And I'm sending you into this land
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.900]   where you haven't built the cities,
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:46:59.900]   nor the houses,
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.900]   nor dig the wells.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.900]   And the whole place is flowing with milk and honey.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.900]   Be careful."
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.900]   Be careful of what?
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.900]   That you don't revert again into a condition
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.900]   which will end in bondage.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.900]   You see, this isn't automatic.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.900]   That's why you have these detailed instructions.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.900]   You might think that it's enough to bring a man out of the bondage.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:23.900]   He'll be all right once he's at liberty.
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.900]   Not at all.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.900]   The whole tendency of men in sin is to go back into bondage,
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.900]   as I told you at the beginning.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.900]   So you have these great instructions.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.900]   And aren't they necessary?
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:40.900]   The history of the Church tells you that they're necessary always
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.900]   because of this fatal tendency in men.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.900]   Have you ever read the story of the free churches in this country?
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.900]   They all started as free churches.
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists, every one of them.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.900]   The free churches.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.900]   They didn't belong to the institutional church, the state church.
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   They were free churches, and they believed in liberty,
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.900]   and they were ready to die for liberty.
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.900]   Free churches.
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.900]   Those are the very churches that are persecuting many evangelical people
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.900]   at the present time.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.900]   They're no longer free.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.900]   They're tied by traditions.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.900]   They're tied by their own enactments.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.900]   They're tied by their own committees.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.900]   They're tied by their own funds.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:29.900]   No, no.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.900]   You can't assume that because you're out, you'll remain out.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.900]   What must we avoid?
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.900]   The first thing to avoid is never to look back to Egypt.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.900]   Have you read the story of these people, these miserable people?
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.900]   There they are in the wilderness, and they said to Moses and to Aaron,
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.900]   "Have you brought us out of Egypt to die in this wilderness?"
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.900]   "We remember," they said, "when we were in Egypt.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.900]   We remember the cucumbers and the melons and the greek
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.900]   and the garlic and the onions and the leeks."
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:04.900]   And they were looking back with longing eyes on Egypt and its flesh pots.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.900]   These people had been in a terrible serfdom and miserable slavery,
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.900]   looking back.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:14.900]   And this has been the most fatal thing in the story of most of the free churches.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:18.900]   Having come out in the name of liberty, they've looked back,
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.900]   and they've begun to desire to be respectable.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.900]   It's a dangerous period in the life of any individual church
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.900]   or body of churches when they seek to be respectable.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.900]   While they're persecuted and a despised minority, there isn't much danger.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.900]   But the second stage comes, and they begin to settle on their lees,
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:42.900]   and they want intellectual respectability or some formal respectability,
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.900]   and they're anxious to have the plaudits of the old denominations
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.900]   and to borrow certain of their methods.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.900]   It is then they begin to go wrong.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.900]   Those who began in freedom become denominational.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.900]   This is the war.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.900]   How do we avoid these things?
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.900]   Keep the commandments. Keep the commandments.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.900]   And the commandments for us are perfectly plain and clear.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.900]   What is a true free evangelical church?
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:16.900]   It's a church that lives on the Bible.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.900]   It's a church that delights in the doctrines of truth,
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.900]   the doctrines of the Scriptures.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.900]   We are not here to pass political pronouncements.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.900]   We are not interested in political or social movements.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.900]   That's the province of the dead denominations.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.900]   What has characterized the people of God and the living evangelical church always
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.900]   has been that it's been the church of the book
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.900]   and being concerned about salvation truth.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.900]   This is the first commandment. Keep to the truth.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:50.900]   Then you come on to the fellowship that results from that
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:54.900]   and the breaking of bread and the praying together.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.900]   The evangelical church should be characterized by prayer meetings
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.900]   rather than by committees.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.900]   The others are experts at committees.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.900]   They've multiplied them and their organizations.
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.900]   But the true church is essentially simple.
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.900]   And she lives by prayer.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:14.900]   And she's not interested in influence or authority or wealth or power.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.900]   She's interested in the spirit of the living God.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.900]   And she knows that the powerhouse of the church is the prayer meeting.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:27.900]   So what characterized the early church is what has always characterized
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:33.900]   the true free evangelical churches in all subsequent eras and periods
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.900]   in the long story of this church of God.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.900]   Keep the commandments.
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.900]   And in other words, I can put it like this.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:50.900]   Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:56.900]   We must watch. Ecclesiae Semper Reformanda.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.900]   The church must be always under the word.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.900]   The fact you've come out isn't enough.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.900]   You may slip back. They have done so, all of them.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.900]   The church must always be reforming herself.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.900]   She must always be examining herself in the light of the scripture,
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.900]   face to face with truth.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.900]   Are we keeping the commandments?
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.900]   Are we looking back?
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.900]   Are we tending to revert?
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.900]   Always under reformation.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.900]   Always self-examination.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:28.900]   Always making sure that we hold to the primitive pattern.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:36.900]   In other words, what the church always needs and what she must always hold to
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:43.900]   are the twin factors that have characterized her from the beginning.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:53.900]   The word and the demonstration of the spirit and of power.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.900]   It's God who's given us everything.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:01.900]   And it's God alone who can keep us going.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:07.900]   As he gave us life, the cities, the houses, the wells, the milk and the honey.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.900]   It's all the free grace of God.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.900]   Nothing of ourselves.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:15.900]   Very well. The church must always live in that spirit.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.900]   Realizing our utter dependence upon him.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.900]   And with an absolute confidence that he which hath begun a good work in us
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:30.900]   will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:37.900]   That though the gates of hell are set against us, they'll never prevail against us.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:42.900]   That the purposes of God are ever sure.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:47.900]   And his promises will never fail.
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:52.900]   The world may deride us and despise us and laugh at us.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.900]   Let the world deride or pity.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:00.900]   I will glory in thy name.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.900]   Nothing matters but that we are the people of God.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:10.900]   He who first put his hand upon us when we were in the Egypt of sin and evil
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:16.900]   and separated us from this present evil world and put us into the church
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:21.900]   is the same God who alone can keep the church
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:27.900]   and will keep the church as long as we keep his commandments
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.900]   and look unto him and unto him alone.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:40.900]   May God bless to us in this critical, confusing period through which we are passing
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:45.900]   the lesson that Moses of old taught the children of Israel
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:51.900]   after the Exodus as they were about to enter the Canaan
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:57.900]   flowing with milk and honey.
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:01.900]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
