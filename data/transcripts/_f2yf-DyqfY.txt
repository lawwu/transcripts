[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   The doctrine of God's providence is the theme of Pastor John's new book by that title,
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   Providence.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.000]   The truth that God governs over everything that he makes is gloriously true.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.280]   And when we see it and embrace it as true and glorious, this doctrine can make a very
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.840]   deep and definite impact on how we live our lives, and especially when suffering hits.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.920]   So we're celebrating the implications on Wednesdays on the podcast.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.160]   There are a total of 10 implications Pastor John wants to address and work through.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.480]   Last time in episode 1586, we looked at how embracing the providence of God enables us
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.080]   to be patient and faithful in the long, dragged out, often unexpected trials of life amidst
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.720]   the most inexplicable circumstances, detours, and delays that, from our limited viewpoint,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.880]   make no sense to us.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.400]   Providence makes us patient in trials.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.640]   That was implication number five.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.400]   Here now with implication number six is Pastor John.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.660]   If someone asks me, "Do you think God planned for those planes to fly into the World Trade
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.840]   Towers in New York on 9/11/2001?"
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.480]   I answer in two ways.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:30.000]   I say, "If God cannot blow a plane with his breath 100 feet off course to the right, then
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.960]   he's not God."
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:46.320]   And I say, "If we surrender the all-governing providence of God in order to save him from
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:58.440]   any causality in those tragic events, then by saving him, I lose him as a sovereign,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.760]   wise God who can give meaning and strength and hope to those who have lost the most in
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   this tragedy."
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:17.360]   In other words, it is the very sovereignty by which he governed those jets that enables
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.200]   him to govern all things for the good of tens of thousands of survivors who look to him
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.520]   for strength and purpose and hope in their massive losses.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:38.240]   So my sixth precious real-life effect of seeing and savoring the all-governing providence
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:49.360]   of God is that this providence assures us that the so-called problem of God's sovereignty
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.920]   in suffering is more than relieved by the sustaining purpose and power of his sovereignty
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.440]   through suffering.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.160]   Now, we all know that Satan's power is real.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.560]   He causes many evil things to happen.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.400]   And human sin is real, and humans, sinful humans, cause many things to happen.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:30.880]   And natural disasters are real, and nature has its own hand in causing calamity.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.560]   But what we see in the Bible over and overâ€”and I wrote this book to try to make hundreds
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.000]   of these places plainâ€”what we see in the Bible over and over is that neither Satan,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.560]   nor man, nor nature ever does anything that was not in the plan of God.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.040]   "My counsel shall stand," says the Lord, "and I will accomplish all my purpose,"
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.320]   Isaiah 46:10.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:11.480]   In the entire sequence of events in this world, God decides finally which causes will
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:23.520]   be effective and which will not, which actions of other wills besides his own he will permit.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.000]   And in the all-wise providence of God, permissions are always purposeful.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.960]   God's permissions are not random.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.280]   God's permissions are not foolish.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.440]   God's permissions are not evil.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.480]   He doesn't will evil.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.100]   That is, he doesn't sin.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.760]   He ordains that sin be, but in ordaining that sin be or come to pass, he does not himself
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.360]   sin.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.120]   Therefore, all suffering is in the sway of God's providence.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.880]   He could always stop it.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.520]   When he doesn't, his permissions are planned and purposeful.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.400]   And in his overall design, wise.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.680]   He is a righteous God.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.700]   All his ways are justice, Deuteronomy 32.4.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.720]   He loves righteous deeds, Psalm 117.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne, Psalm 97.2.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.800]   He will judge the world in righteousness, Psalm 98.9.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.720]   His righteousness endures forever, Psalm 111.3.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.600]   We are not God.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.220]   We are not omniscient, we are not all wise, and therefore we cannot always see the goodness
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.580]   and wisdom and justice of God in his providence.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:10.060]   But he has proven himself to us in Christ over and over, especially at the cross, and
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.900]   we trust him.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:22.940]   And for those who trust Christ and God in Christ, God's sovereignty in suffering is
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.780]   not an unyielding problem.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.260]   It is an unfailing hope.
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.740]   That's what I'm trying to get across.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.480]   I'll say it again.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:44.400]   For those who trust God in Christ, his sovereignty in suffering is not an unyielding problem,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.240]   it is an unfailing hope.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:55.800]   It means that in the suffering of Christians, neither Satan nor man nor nature nor chance
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.640]   is wielding decisive control.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:07.680]   God is sovereign over our suffering, which means it is not meaningless.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.180]   It is not wrath.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.160]   It is not ultimately destructive.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.120]   It is not wanton or heedless.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   It is purposeful.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.120]   It is measured.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.080]   It is wise.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.760]   It is loving.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.120]   It is working for us in eternal weight of glory.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:37.580]   If I may bear witness from 50 years of ministering the Word of God like this to many, many suffering
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.260]   people, here is what I would say.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:47.840]   For every one person whom I have heard or seen forsaking the truth of God's all-pervasive
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:55.940]   providence because of suffering, I have seen 10 others bear witness that the biblical truth
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:03.820]   of God's absolute sovereignty in and over their suffering and loss saved their faith,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.280]   and some have said saved their sanity.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:16.760]   Indeed, it saved not only their faith in God and their sanity of mind, but also their love
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.400]   for people.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.480]   Now how is that?
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:29.760]   How does the providence of God in our suffering save our love for people?
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:38.520]   Love cannot flourish where fear or greed or self-pity or anger consumes the heart, right?
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:45.840]   The heart must be set free from self-focus for the sake of focusing on others, Philippians
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.920]   2.4.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:54.840]   Everything must break the power that fear and greed and anger and self-pity have on
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:07.000]   the soul, and what breaks this power is the unshakable certainty of hope, hope that is
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:19.180]   warranted by the unstoppable, blood-bought mercy of God in his all-governing providence.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:27.080]   If our suffering turns us in on ourselves, we will not love others in the midst of our
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.520]   affliction.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.400]   But that's precisely where Christian love is supposed to shine.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:46.900]   2 Corinthians 8, verse 2, "In a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy overflowed
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:53.400]   in a wealth of generosity," that is, in love.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:10:04.000]   Joy overflowing with generosity in affliction, that is the beauty of Christian love.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.320]   And how can there be such triumphant, loving joy in affliction?
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.400]   And the answer is hope, certain hope.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:24.200]   For the joy that was set before him as a hope, a certain hope, for the joy that was set before
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.860]   him, Jesus endured the cross.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.720]   That's the most loving act that was ever done in the history of the world, and it was empowered
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.080]   by hope.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:42.720]   The confidence of a joyful future breaks the power of fear and greed and anger and self-pity
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.160]   and frees the heart for love.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:55.860]   This is how the Christian soul in suffering is saved from bitterness and revenge and self-indulgence
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.760]   and self-pity.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:07.820]   For those who trust Christ, the providence of God turns every sorrow to joy, every loss
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.840]   to gain, every groan to glory.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:19.880]   In other words, for thousands of suffering Christians, the all-pervasive providence of
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:32.920]   God is not a barrier for faith, but the ground of faith-preserving, sanity-sustaining, love-empowering
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.600]   hope.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:44.160]   So my sixth real-life effect of seeing and savoring the providence of God is that this
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:55.280]   providence assures us that the so-called problem of God's sovereignty in suffering is more
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:05.000]   than relieved by the sustaining purpose and power of his sovereignty through suffering.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.100]   That is powerful.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:12.360]   The so-called problem of God's sovereignty in suffering is more than relieved by the
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.280]   sustaining purpose and power of his sovereignty through suffering.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.280]   That's deep.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.760]   Purposeful suffering is worth meditating on for some time.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   So good.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.920]   Such a great implication.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.720]   These are the kinds of truths and implications you will find in Pastor John's new book, Providence.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   Great stuff.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.820]   And speaking of deep thoughts that can change your life, next up we are going to ask, what
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.000]   is the meaning of life?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.720]   What is the meaning of life?
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.840]   It doesn't get much more important than that.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:50.920]   That's up next time on Friday when we return to the inbox for more of your great questions.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.800]   I am Tony Reinke and Pastor John and I will see you then.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.300]   Bye.
