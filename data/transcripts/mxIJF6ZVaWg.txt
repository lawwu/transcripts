[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - Welcome to a new week on the podcast.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.960]   We start the week with an email
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.900]   from a podcast listener named Jessica
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.640]   from Davis, California, and it couldn't be more important.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.200]   Pastor John, as I talk with millennials
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.640]   about Christ and the gospel,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.200]   I've repeatedly had people say that they don't believe
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.040]   that someone else paying the punishment
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.040]   for another's sin, substitutionary atonement, is just.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.840]   I too have internal pushback against this,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.840]   but have come to know that substitutionary atonement
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.000]   has its roots in the Mosaic sacrificial system.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.760]   Our generation, however, at least in California,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.560]   is biblically illiterate
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.840]   and doesn't have this framework to go off of.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.040]   How would you explain the justice
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.640]   of substitutionary atonement to this generation?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.200]   - Well, not much more could be more important
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.640]   than the question of whether Christ was, in fact,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.200]   a just and merciful substitute for sinners,
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.200]   so that when he died for his elect,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.280]   he actually bore their punishment
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.000]   so that they can experience no condemnation.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.440]   That is the heart of the Christian gospel.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.160]   If that goes, everything goes,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.920]   and let us eat, drink, and be merry,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.480]   for tomorrow we perish.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.200]   Now, there are at least two issues here.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.760]   One is how biblical authority relates
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.760]   to the categories of thought in people's minds,
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.400]   and the other is how to help people today
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.880]   grasp the justice of the atonement,
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   given what they presently have as categories in their mind.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.960]   A word about that first issue.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.160]   My approach to biblical authority
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.760]   in relation to John Piper's fallen and fallible mind
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.640]   is to try, at least try, to let the Bible shape
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.960]   and even create categories of thought in my mind.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.400]   In other words, if I come to the Bible
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.600]   and I find I don't have a category
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.660]   to make sense out of something,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.720]   I wanna try to let the Bible shape
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.440]   or create new categories.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.960]   The alternative, it seems to me,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.440]   would be to insist that the Bible,
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.600]   God's word whose ways are higher than my ways,
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.360]   be squeezed into my present ways of thinking.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.540]   I mean, it's just absurd.
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.520]   It's absurd when I think about it.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.320]   All over the world, people are trying to squeeze the Bible,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.640]   limit the Bible into their conceptuality
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.940]   that they inherited from their sinful culture and parents.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.780]   If people today are unwilling to have their way of thinking
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.180]   about the world changed,
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.260]   then either we will twist the Bible
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.020]   to fit our preconceptions or we will reject the Bible
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.500]   because the Bible is resolute
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.780]   in insisting that Christ died in the place of sinners
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.420]   so that the justice of God is satisfied
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.860]   and sinners escape punishment.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.580]   So Galatians 3:13, "Christ redeemed us from the curse,"
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.420]   that's God's curse, "the curse of the law
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.960]   by becoming a curse for us.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.900]   It is written, 'Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.'"
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.900]   Or Isaiah 53, 5, "He was pierced for our transgressions."
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.820]   Our transgressions.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.460]   He pierced, we transgressed, he's pierced.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.540]   "He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.500]   Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.940]   and with his wounds we are healed."
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.380]   Glory, glory.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.380]   - Oh my, yes, amen.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.340]   - "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree,"
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.940]   1 Peter 2:24.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.540]   One more, I love this one because it's the kind of image
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.840]   I expect for a Sunday school teacher to create
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.020]   and actually Paul created it.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   "God canceled the record of debt that stood against us
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.780]   with its legal demands."
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.660]   This, this record of debt,
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.660]   "He set aside, nailing it to the cross."
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.660]   In other words, when the spike was put against Jesus' hand,
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.760]   actually the spike was lifted up,
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.680]   a document was inserted between the spike and the hand
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.000]   called Record of John Piper's and Tony Ranke's Debts
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.200]   and it was driven through the record,
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.480]   into the hand, into the wood,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.480]   and that record was settled, paid, finished.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.760]   Now those are simply glorious truths.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.320]   And I grieve, I grieve that there are people
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   who turn away from those truths as inconceivable or unjust,
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.200]   but I'm not surprised because Paul said,
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.520]   "Greeks see it as foolishness
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.440]   and Jews call it a stumbling block."
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.560]   So we need grace to have our categories of thought
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.780]   adjusted by the Bible.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.400]   Now the second issue of how then do we try?
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.740]   That's what I wanna do here for just a minute.
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.640]   So let me make an effort to try to describe
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.480]   the justice of the atonement.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.520]   This is a little bit like trying
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.020]   to conceptualize the Trinity.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.320]   It's always risky because human conceptuality
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.200]   of divine things might be inadequate.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.420]   I mean, they are inadequate in that they're not
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.040]   comprehensive, but let's see if they can be true at least.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040]   So here goes.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   The fundamental issue here is what does sin do to God
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.880]   and how is this set right?
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.140]   The most important answer is that sin dishonors God.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.660]   It detracts from his glory.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.660]   It belittles him.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.660]   It treats him as inferior in value to what we prefer
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.900]   in our sinful desire.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.220]   I think that's what sin is.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.020]   This is why the most important paragraph on the atonement
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.020]   in the Bible contains the words, this is Romans 3.23,
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.520]   all have sinned and fall short or lack,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.100]   literally lack, the glory of God.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.460]   In other words, sin is related to glory
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.580]   and it's related as losing glory,
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.220]   that is exchanging the glory of God for images,
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.860]   chapter one, verse 23.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.060]   It's an effort to rob God of his glory.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.980]   So the greatest problem in the universe
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.740]   is that God's creatures have gone on record
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.500]   as devaluing the glory of God.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.900]   It's as if the image of the Roman Caesar
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.900]   was ripped off the wall and trampled by mobs.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.300]   And treason like that has always been a capital crime
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.580]   everywhere in the world.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.340]   Trampling the glory of the most glorious being
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.340]   is the most serious crime in the universe.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.440]   How then is this situation to be remedied justly?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.580]   How's justice to be done here?
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.300]   And the answer is that the injury done
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.140]   to the glory of God has to be repaired.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.560]   That's what justice is.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.180]   Justice is, or righteousness is,
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.620]   that the glory of God is to be restored
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.160]   to its rightful place of exaltation and admiration.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   This justice happens by stripping glory
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.940]   from the perpetrators in proportion
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.660]   to the way they have stripped it from God.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.180]   That's the meaning of hell.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.660]   It will take an eternity to strip sufficient glory
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.940]   from finite creatures.
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.140]   They don't have infinite glory.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.820]   So it will take an infinite amount of time
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.020]   to balance the enormity of defacing the glory
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.820]   of an infinite being.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.860]   And that punishment is therefore eternal.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.860]   And the question is, can Christ perform this repair
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.540]   of the glory of God for the people of God?
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.380]   And the answer of the Bible is yes.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.140]   And the reason is that Christ came precisely
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.800]   to vindicate the glory of God.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.820]   That's not true of any criminal on the planet
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.900]   who's in prison today.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.460]   That's why we can't do this kind of thing among men.
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.260]   The reason Christ came is precisely to repair,
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.060]   to vindicate the glory of God.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.740]   Here's a glimpse of it in John 12, 27.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.980]   "Now is my soul troubled," Jesus said.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.540]   "And what shall I say?
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.340]   Father, save me from this hour,
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.220]   name me the hour of his death?
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.220]   No, but for this purpose, I have come to this hour.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.060]   Father, glorify your name."
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.120]   Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.140]   and I will glorify it again."
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.300]   This is the ultimate reason for the death of Jesus.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.300]   He came to repair the injury we had done
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.380]   to the glory of God.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.500]   He laid aside his glory.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.220]   Philippians 2, he emptied himself, laid aside his glory.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.220]   He endured utter humiliation, not in a random way,
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.060]   but precisely for the glory of the Father.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:12.060]   Christ's whole incarnation was a reversal of our attack
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.620]   on the glory of God.
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.820]   Since he's infinitely valuable,
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.700]   his loss of glory in his humiliation and death
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.140]   can cover all of our God-diminishing,
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.940]   God-dishonoring, God-defaming sins.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.260]   And therefore, complete justice can be done
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.780]   in justifying the ungodly, like us.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.780]   The glory of God is vindicated precisely in respect
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.680]   to the ways we have insulted the glory of God.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.140]   Christ loses glory in suffering and dying
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.260]   precisely for the ways I have caused God
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.120]   to lose glory in my sins.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.300]   And so, God is shown to be glorious
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.660]   in passing over my sins for the sake of Jesus,
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.540]   who lived and died to restore the glory of his Father.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.820]   And that's precisely what justice demands.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.820]   So, oh, oh, how I hope God will open the eyes
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:25.000]   of those who think that the heart of the Bible,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.460]   the heart of the gospel,
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.100]   the best news in all the world is unjust.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.660]   It is, in fact, the highest expression of justice
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.660]   that ever was and the greatest act of mercy.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.180]   - That is a magnificent presentation of the gospel,
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.020]   Pastor John.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.240]   Wow, how precious and unfathomable is the depth
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.660]   of the wisdom of God in the atonement.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.500]   Amazing.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.020]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.800]   Well, we have an email from a listener of ours in France
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.300]   who wants to know, "How do we delight in God
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.140]   "and delight in excelling at our work?
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.620]   "How do we delight in God and delight in personal excellence?"
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.900]   That's an interesting question,
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.260]   and that is on the table tomorrow.
