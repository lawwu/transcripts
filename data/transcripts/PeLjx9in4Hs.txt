[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100]   The other big change in the points and miles world,
[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.320]   we knew this was coming,
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.120]   but a lot more details were shared
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.180]   about what's going on with Southwest
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.180]   and all the new changes coming
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.480]   because it's going to be a totally different experience.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.980]   So starting May 28th, any new reservations,
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.540]   or if you have an existing reservation
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.320]   and you change it after May 28th,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160]   you're no longer going to have free check bag
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.340]   unless you're business extra.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.260]   They're also launching on that same day,
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.240]   the basic fair,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.640]   which is effectively the want to get away fair rebranded,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.080]   but you're no longer going to be able to make any changes
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.280]   or earn more than 2x points on those fairs.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.780]   So they're adding their basic economy.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780]   They are not changing the cancel fees.
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.340]   So even with that basic fair,
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.220]   you'll be able to cancel for a flight credit.
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.420]   But remember, Southwest flight credits
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.860]   now will be expiring within, I think, a year.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.460]   So that also sucks.
