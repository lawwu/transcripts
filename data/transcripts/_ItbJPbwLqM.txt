[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - Good Monday morning and thanks for joining us again.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.720]   Well, we happen to be in a season on the podcast
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.540]   looking at some mature issues
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.200]   and those issues are rather bleak, not by design.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.040]   It just ended up that way providentially
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.920]   in the questions we have on the table.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.560]   Last Monday, we looked at whether we can be angry at God
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.320]   when life doesn't turn out the way we hoped it would.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.900]   That was ABJ 1828.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.920]   Then we looked at how to overcome anger in the home.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.680]   That was ABJ 1829.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.320]   And last time on Friday, a wife asked about
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.040]   how to confront some deep ongoing sin patterns
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.240]   in the life of her husband.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.980]   That was ABJ 1830.
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.480]   And that brings us to today.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.120]   A young wife writes in, she was betrayed
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.840]   and now she endures the lingering pain of a husband
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.120]   who left her for another woman.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.560]   Here's what she writes.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.800]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.220]   I've been struggling for two years
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.160]   to find the right biblical approach to this
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.280]   and hope that perhaps you can afford me some clarity.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.280]   My husband, once a professing believer in Christ,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.400]   left our three young girls and me for another woman.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.620]   He divorced me a little over a year ago.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.400]   Throughout this journey, I have struggled
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.840]   with an appropriate God-honoring response
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.680]   to his ongoing sinful and hurtful behaviors
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.380]   toward our daughters and me.
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.360]   I'm torn between a righteous anger and tough love
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.440]   as Jesus showed by turning tables in the temple
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.600]   and an unconditional grace as in turning the other cheek.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.700]   Loving my enemies in 1 Peter 2.23.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.360]   What is the biblical approach to responding
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.840]   to such betrayal and unrepentant sin?
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.840]   Let's start with some things that Jesus says
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.420]   about forgiveness and about loving our enemies.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.420]   Forgiveness in its fullest form involves two parties,
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.740]   one of which has sinned against the other
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.640]   and is repenting and asking for forgiveness,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.560]   and the other was sinned against
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.200]   and is graciously granting the forgiveness
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.020]   being sought through repentance.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.240]   We see a picture of this in Luke 17.3 and 4.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.980]   If your brother sins, rebuke him.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.520]   And if he repents, forgive him.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.040]   And if he sins against you seven times in the day
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.640]   and turns to you seven times and says, "I repent,"
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.160]   you must forgive him.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.340]   So that's a picture of the two-way street,
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.280]   wronging, repenting, forgiving,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.880]   and forgiveness in the fullest sense is only possible
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.680]   when there is that kind of repentance.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.680]   Then we ask, well, what's required of us
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.640]   if the person who has sinned against us does not repent?
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.560]   And the answer is that we are called to love our enemy.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.620]   In a sense, you could call this a kind of forgiveness
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.740]   because forgiveness in its essence
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.740]   means letting something go.
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.800]   Don't use it to return evil for evil
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.920]   or to hurt another person.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.740]   But this one-sided mercy
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.160]   is not forgiveness in the fullest sense.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.480]   And so the New Testament has other ways
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.220]   of describing how we relate to people who wrong us
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.260]   and either don't care,
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.700]   they just thumb in their nose at us,
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.460]   or they don't think they wronged us.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.780]   We call this different names.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.460]   The New Testament calls it patience,
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.340]   long-suffering, forbearance, enemy love.
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.260]   And to be clear, when Jesus speaks of loving our enemies,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.140]   he doesn't have in mind warm feelings
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.340]   of admiration or approval.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.740]   Instead, Jesus gives three examples,
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.000]   or maybe better, three explanations,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.620]   Luke 6, 27, 28, he says that
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.180]   loving our enemies involves this.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.580]   Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.780]   bless those who curse you,
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.340]   pray for those who abuse you.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.340]   So 30 things, do good, bless, pray for.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.820]   So what we're called to do towards those who have wronged us
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.820]   or continue to wrong us is to wish their ultimate good,
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.600]   which might involve temporary pain like prison.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.280]   He's not saying there's no consequences
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.200]   for sins and crimes.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.960]   It might be some discipline from the church
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.840]   or some justice in society,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.740]   but he is saying wish their ultimate good.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.240]   That's what bless means, and that's what we pray for.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.880]   And then put that into action by doing good.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.160]   That is, seeking to treat them in ways better
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.920]   than they deserve.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.600]   Now, I can think of numerous objections
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.120]   that might come up.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.480]   Why such forgiveness or love towards people,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.880]   towards a husband who have wronged you,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.240]   like this particular betraying of a husband
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.480]   that is so painful.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.440]   Why it would be so hard,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.800]   or maybe we would feel it to be even wrong
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   to treat a person as well as Jesus says we should.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.720]   So let me address four of those objections
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.440]   that might arise, particularly for this wife.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.680]   And I think maybe even this will even clarify
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   what's really involved in such a relationship
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.560]   of betrayal and forgiveness.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.100]   But here's the first one.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.480]   It just seems unjust that in a sense,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   the guilty person has gotten away with so much,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.840]   a great wrong, without paying any serious price,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.720]   while leaving a lot of devastation in the wake.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.880]   Now, the biblical answer to that objection
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.400]   and that heartfelt concern
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.720]   is that God in his universe
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.660]   never lets anybody get away with anything.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.220]   Never, nobody gets away with anything.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.060]   The way we can sleep at night,
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.580]   knowing that it seems like someone
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.640]   has gotten away with murder,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.160]   is this promise in Romans 12, 19.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.120]   Beloved, never avenge yourselves,
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.400]   leave it to the wrath of God,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.000]   for it is written, vengeance is mine,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.260]   I will repay, says the Lord.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.040]   Now that's a promise.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.120]   I will repay.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   What that means is God will settle all accounts
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.340]   with absolute justice.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.880]   And nobody ever gets away with anything
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.160]   when you take all of eternity into account.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.040]   When we refuse to enact vengeance ourselves,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.520]   God takes up our cause
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.560]   and performs eventually everything that needs to be done
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.960]   so that there is perfect justice.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.720]   Therefore, we dare never say,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.100]   "Well, I guess they just got away with it."
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.840]   Nobody ever gets away with anything.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.200]   But the burden of settling accounts is lifted.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   It's lifted from us and put on God's shoulders
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.320]   who does all things well.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   He will settle accounts either in hell
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.240]   or he has settled accounts on the cross.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.160]   Nobody gets away with anything.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.400]   That's the first objection that God overcomes
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.120]   with this promise of justice.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.960]   A second objection to this kind of forgiveness
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.600]   that feels so hard or enemy love
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   is that we simply cannot trust the person who has wronged us.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.440]   Now, the answer to this objection
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.480]   is that forgiveness and trust are not the same thing.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.480]   You can genuinely forgive while not yet trusting again.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.200]   I don't say this will be easy.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.760]   It won't be easy.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.120]   A person might say, "You have not really forgiven me."
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.600]   So the person you're forgiving,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.120]   they'll say, "You haven't really forgiven me
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.480]   because you're holding this over my head
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.340]   and not trusting me."
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.320]   But the response to that is,
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   "I'm not holding the guilt of past act or sin or hurt
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.780]   over your head.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.600]   I forgive you for that and I pray God will.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.280]   And I wish you well.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   What I am dealing with is not a past guilty act,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.160]   but a present concern that your character
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.820]   does not warrant a present trust.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.540]   You may gain that trust eventually,
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.680]   but it has not yet been established."
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.200]   That's my answer to that objection.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.800]   It's just too hard to trust.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.200]   And I'm saying forgiveness and trust aren't the same.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.080]   A third objection to forgiveness and love that's so hard
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.920]   is that the action, the wrong,
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.600]   was so abhorrent to your heart
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.720]   that you still recoil inside with disgust
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.040]   or abhorrence toward it.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.840]   Now, the answer to that objection is that genuine love
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   and abhorrence of evil are not mutually exclusive,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.960]   not even in the same heart at the same time.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   I've always been amazed at Romans 12, nine,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.840]   at what Paul puts back to back.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.040]   He says this, "Let love be genuine,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.080]   abhor what is evil."
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.240]   That's amazing.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.240]   He would put love and abhorrence next to each other
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.160]   in the same command, in the very same verse, back to back.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.820]   Let love be genuine, abhor.
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.660]   It's a big word.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.840]   I mean, it's not the word hate.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   It's really emotionally a strong word in Greek.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.960]   It is possible to bless and pray for and do good
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.680]   to a person whose destructive attitudes
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.440]   and actions we abhor.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.000]   That's my answer to the third objection.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.960]   Finally, a fourth objection might be,
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.240]   look, Pastor John, my children who've been abandoned,
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.400]   betrayed by their dad, my children need to know
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.080]   how evil the action of their father was,
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.040]   and that doesn't seem loving to him
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.420]   or maybe to them to tell them.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.240]   Now, I think that's one of the hardest issues
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.680]   in dealing with a divorce while trying
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.580]   to maintain some kind of relationship
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.880]   between the children and both parents,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.920]   especially when one of them has grievously,
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.180]   maybe abhorrently sinned.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.180]   So much will depend on how old the children are
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.240]   and how much they can understand
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.320]   and what their own spiritual maturity is,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.240]   but I would say that it is essential
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   that the evil of the betrayal not be minimized
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   because in order for forgiveness to be as glorious as it is,
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   evil must be as wicked as it is.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.640]   Therefore, as the children are able,
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.720]   we try to make both of those clear,
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.520]   the evil of the sin and the beauty of the forgiveness
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.600]   because of how the Lord has forgiven us.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.720]   And so it may be that in the end,
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   even at one of the most painful points in the tragedy,
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:55.000]   the gospel can shine brightly in the lives of our children.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.840]   - Young eyes are watching and learning.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.420]   So bring perspective for how all parents
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.920]   should respond to being sinned against.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.360]   And thank you to all of you
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.480]   who send in your most painful stories.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.420]   We don't take it lightly
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.080]   that you share those stories with us.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   Speaking of enemy love,
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.600]   this topic that we talked about today
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.000]   raises the question of, well, who exactly is our enemy?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.400]   At least as I was listening to this episode today,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.500]   it raised that question for me,
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.380]   especially if our enemy could be a former spouse,
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.320]   someone we were married to who becomes our enemy.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.080]   So who is our enemy biblically?
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.960]   How do we use that category and apply it to our own lives?
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.040]   We'll explore that category next time.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.920]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.000]   Thank you for listening.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.040]   And we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
