[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.320]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.060]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.840]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.200]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.280]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.640]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.840]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.200]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.600]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.480]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.480]   you will find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.720]   So, go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.780]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.000]   Well, listeners, I'm happy to have you with us.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   We have been exploring the idea of assessment
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   for a couple of episodes.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.760]   We have learned a whole lot from Rachel Moriarty,
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.200]   who is here today to give us a little bit more information.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.160]   But if you've missed a couple of episodes,
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.520]   let me kind of bring you up to speed
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.280]   with what we've been learning.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.320]   And if you need to jump back an episode or two
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.060]   and pick up the threads, you'll be able to.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.060]   We have learned that assessing really is about blessing.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.480]   It's about blessing our children, blessing our families,
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.400]   blessing the relationship we have within our families.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.680]   It's about blessing our conversations,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.560]   and even blessing the growth that we experience,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.040]   both as students and as parents.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.480]   Assessing and learning to assess well
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.760]   really is, we've discovered, a growing experience
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   for parents who learn how to assess the important things,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.000]   which is very important as we shepherd our children.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.440]   And it's a growing experience for students
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.440]   who hopefully learn the art of self-assessment,
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   which will be a blessing to them throughout life.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.440]   We ended up by reminding ourselves that assessment,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   however, is not or should not be an end in itself.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.280]   That assessment is really just an activity
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.700]   that gives us a snapshot of our homeschool journey.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.160]   And, you know, it occurred to me,
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   a snapshot can be marred by any number of circumstances
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.320]   that are not really the subject's problem.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   So it really helps that we are learning how to assess well
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.720]   so that we get a snapshot that's not a mess.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.960]   All right, so today, like I said,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.320]   we have Rachel here with us again.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.880]   Rachel is going to help us get ready
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.600]   to create that ultimate snapshot, a transcript.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.200]   But we're actually gonna try something
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.360]   a little different today.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.680]   Rachel is gonna become the presenter,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   and I have agreed to be the question answerer
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.520]   instead of the question asker.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.000]   So Rachel is going to help me process through some ideas
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.480]   that hopefully you will be able to process along with me.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.080]   Okay, Rachel, I put myself in your hands.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.720]   - All right, thank you so much for allowing me
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.600]   to switch roles with you for a little bit.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.320]   And we're gonna walk this journey of the game together,
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.920]   right, just a journey rather, more of a journey,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.140]   but we get to have fun along the way,
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.080]   just like if we were playing a game.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.920]   So I've had fun with you a lot
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.600]   these last few weeks,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.560]   and I look forward to today's conversation.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.200]   So transcripts, and we talked about last week
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.500]   how transcripts can create some negative feelings,
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.000]   right, within us.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.940]   So I'd like to think about a different topic.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.240]   Okay, you like movies, right?
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.140]   - I do.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.480]   - Okay, so my kids make fun of me
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.760]   because they say that I like to watch movie trailers
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.080]   more than I like to actually watch movies.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.480]   And I don't know if you're like me,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.960]   but after watching an hour of movie trailers
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.640]   and not figuring out what movie I wanna watch,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.700]   I'm ready for bed.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.540]   Who needs the movie, right?
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.080]   - I know, it's like, okay, yep, I've had enough.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.840]   Thank you, I've been entertained.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.000]   I've been intrigued, I'm good.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.960]   - And I tell the kids,
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.320]   actually, I just watched eight movies, right?
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.160]   I mean, what's the big deal?
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.020]   - That's right, I have enough of stories in my head
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.000]   that when I go to sleep, I'm gonna have some good dreams,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.880]   right, I have story problems.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.200]   - Well, let's talk about a movie for a second, okay?
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.040]   A movie, what are some parts that go into making a movie?
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.400]   - Well, I'm a writer, so I know that a movie needs a script.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.000]   - Okay, okay, what else?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.560]   - So we need a script, we need actors.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.640]   - Yep.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.320]   - We need costumes, we need set designers.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.300]   We need a director who can say,
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.420]   okay, we're gonna shoot this scene now and this scene now,
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.520]   but then when we get an editor,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.560]   they might reorder these things.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.840]   So we need an editor, we need somebody running the camera,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.920]   not just calling the shots, but running the camera.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.760]   Then we need a set designer who can, I guess,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.980]   read the script and figure out
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.880]   what the atmosphere should be like
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.620]   or what the places should, you know,
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.200]   how can what we see add to the story
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.260]   or tell a part of the story without words.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.360]   - Well, I think that you actually know more about movies
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.680]   than I do, that's an impressive point.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.760]   - Isn't that hilarious?
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.280]   I did not realize that I was gonna go on and on like that,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.960]   but there's, I don't know, I guess what I think
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   is that there's a lot of parts,
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.120]   there's a lot of moving parts to a movie.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.000]   And I think I have been involved in enough filmings
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.760]   with classical conversations that I know
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.840]   it's a lot more involved than it looks like
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.360]   from the finished product.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.320]   - Amen to that.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.400]   Okay, well, let's say that a movie is like,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.200]   if we relate that to the education life of our child,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.320]   who might the child be in this metaphor?
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:08.000]   Does the child make all the shots?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.560]   Does the child- - No, do they?
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.760]   - I, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.840]   They like to think they should, right, or can, but-
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   - Yes, and the older they get,
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.200]   the more they stick their oar in, you know,
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.560]   the more they want to be in the driver's seat.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.040]   And I guess, really, Rachel, as they get ready to graduate,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.680]   they should be learning to make some of those decisions.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.160]   - That's true, yeah, that's true.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.280]   - They should be, but-
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.640]   - That makes me think of, okay,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.120]   so let's say my five-year-old might be the main actor
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.120]   in a play or in the movie, right, might be the hero.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.880]   - Right, that's what I think, they're the main actor.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.960]   - But maybe, I like what you just said,
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.480]   because maybe by the time they are in high school,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.080]   maybe they're like those actor-producers,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.280]   do you know what I'm talking about,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.000]   where they have a little more stake in it
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   and more say than your everyday actor.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.840]   - And they have a little more experience
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.240]   so that the people, the producer,
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.960]   who's actually putting up the money,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.360]   trusts them a little more
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.160]   because they've seen some of their work before.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.760]   - Exactly, yeah, so then who might the director be?
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.160]   - Well, I tend to think that that's the homeschool parent,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.320]   you know, that they have seen the script,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.040]   they've seen the talent, they've seen the resources,
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.920]   and they are kind of above the story a little bit,
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   able to show people in the best light
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   and tell the story in the most understandable way.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.280]   - Yes, yes, that's good.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.400]   So, and I might even say, as parents,
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.720]   you know, as directors of this movie,
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.760]   we also need a director of our own, right?
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.600]   - Yes, we do.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   - Which is the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.680]   The Holy Spirit has to be directing our steps
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   so that we can do a good job of directing their steps
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.640]   until they're ready to be passed to God, right?
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.080]   And released for Him to then direct their steps directly.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.600]   Well, what about the script?
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:30.320]   - Well, I think the script is our curriculum plan.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.520]   It's what we have designed,
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.600]   what courses we've designed our student to take,
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.320]   what style of learning, you know, the environment,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.400]   what they, the motions they have gone through
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.040]   to build the skills of learning
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.240]   and to amass a foundation of knowledge.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.560]   - Excellent, yep, I agree with that.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.640]   It seems the fitting place for it.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.120]   So who is the audience?
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:05.160]   - Of this movie called "The Educational Life of My Child."
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   - Well, okay, so I can think of several different audiences
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.320]   in my most spiritually mature,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.480]   I realized that the audience should just be the Lord.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.240]   My husband's a guitar player and he has the best t-shirt.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.600]   It says, "Playing for an audience of one."
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.840]   Everything we do, if we do unto the Lord, that is beautiful.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.480]   In the real world and in the high pressure,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.880]   I gotta get this right world
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.680]   that many of us parents live in,
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.920]   the audience for this movie,
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.400]   "The Homeschool Education of My Fill-in-the-Blank Child,"
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.480]   it is the people who are gonna make decisions
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.120]   about their next opportunities.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.240]   And, you know, maybe that's an employer
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.840]   or maybe that's a college recruiter
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.680]   or it's a scholarship decider
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.920]   or it's a mission organization.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.520]   - And maybe even a governing body,
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.040]   like maybe they weren't gonna go off,
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.680]   we're not talking about a job or college as in the final.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.560]   Sometimes it's, "Hey, I have to turn in."
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.200]   Yeah, locally, you know?
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.480]   Or as a parent, I have to turn in a transcript to enroll.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.440]   You know, certain states have different laws
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.880]   that require reporting of various natures, right?
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.960]   - Yes, I have to turn it in once a year.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.120]   I've got to show what we've been doing at our homeschool.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.000]   Or if my child wants to do CC+
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   or some kind of dual enrollment,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.280]   somebody needs to know what they've done.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.080]   And so my transcript is my way of telling them the story
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.760]   in a way they can understand.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.640]   - Yeah, and if we're thinking about the education
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.000]   of a child, sometimes our audience
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.840]   can even be family members, like extended family members.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.160]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.280]   - When I first decided to homeschool,
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.000]   my daughter was four,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.080]   and I was reading all kinds of books
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.800]   to try to decide which philosophy
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.440]   or the way I wanted to go about this.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.920]   I wasn't even confident how to do it
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.440]   or that I could do it, but I felt compelled
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.000]   because of reading that verse in Deuteronomy
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.400]   that says to teach your children,
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.800]   "When you stand up, when you lie down,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.840]   "when you go on the way."
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.480]   And I'm thinking, how am I supposed to do that
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.720]   if I'm not with them, right?
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.160]   And so that was a motivating guide for me
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.280]   of even being drawn into homeschooling.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.440]   Well, my mother-in-law, she's a public educator
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.120]   for 40, 50 years, and she is a music teacher,
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.520]   and she's brilliant.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.080]   And she's had a lot of training with education and stuff.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.440]   And she comes to me and says,
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.760]   "Rachel, what about science labs?
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.720]   "How are you gonna do science labs?"
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.600]   And I have a four-year-old,
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   and I don't even know how to get them to read, you know?
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.480]   - Right, my science lab is playing with water in the sink.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.360]   - I was like, I have no idea.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.080]   I'm just trying to figure out what do I do this year
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.320]   and what they gotta do, you know?
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.760]   - Yes, yes.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.840]   - Looking back on it, she didn't mean anything against me
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   by asking that.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.240]   It's just, she had a scope of it that I didn't have,
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.800]   and she's thinking farther out.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.280]   And it's not that you think farther out,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.640]   because most of us are.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.080]   I can't tell you how many times I've talked to parents
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.440]   who it's like, "Well, I made a commitment for this year,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.640]   "but I don't know, you know, we take it year by year.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.120]   "I don't know what I'm gonna do."
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.880]   And that's an honest answer.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.360]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.960]   - But they probably feel the pressures
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.680]   of their family as well, like I did.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.720]   Have to know all the things or, you know,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.640]   'cause the grandma loves your children
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.400]   just as much as you love your children,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.760]   and they want, but we each talk out of what we know, right?
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.240]   - Yes, yes.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.720]   - So, all right, so let's talk about
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.440]   the role of the director.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.960]   Can you tell me, what does a director of a movie do?
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.320]   - Okay, so I'm talking kind of out of my ignorance,
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.400]   but, you know, from things that I have seen and heard,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.640]   and what I have observed of directors
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.920]   from being in plays as a kid and as an adult,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.600]   I think that the director gives direction.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.880]   He tells the actor or the actress
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.120]   how to move or how to speak or how to deliver their line,
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.520]   maybe when to come in and which way to turn or to face
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.120]   to give the best performance.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.840]   The director is constantly trying to help the actor
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.480]   be all he can be and bring all the skill
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.440]   that the actor has within him to the forefront
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.480]   so that he leaves nothing on the table
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.120]   and is not disappointed that he didn't try something
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.560]   or do something he could have done.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.120]   - Right, okay, good.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.480]   So what is the movie trailer?
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   - The movie trailer is what encourages somebody like me
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   to take a chance on a movie that doesn't,
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.400]   maybe the title didn't grab me,
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.280]   but the trailer gives me something to listen to
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.600]   and look at that maybe provides the hook
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.200]   that I needed to take a second look
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.680]   or to devote a little more of my time.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.200]   It kind of wets my appetite, either for the story
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.160]   or for the portrayal of the story.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.520]   - Okay, so the summary of that story,
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.520]   and we could call this in education life of a transcript,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.000]   possibly a, I mean, excuse me,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.680]   we could call this in the education life of a child,
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.840]   a transcript.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.960]   - Yeah, we're gonna give you the overall picture.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.280]   Good, that's good.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.240]   - So we're gonna talk today about the role of the director
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.600]   and the role of a movie trailer in your child's life, okay?
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.800]   So let me think about,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.840]   so there are two documents that we typically think of
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.360]   associated with graduating.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.720]   Can you recall what those might be?
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.600]   - A diploma, that's what you get when you,
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.640]   that shows you did it,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.160]   and a transcript that is the record
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   of all the stuff you did that earned you the diploma.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.080]   - Okay, and that's really only,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.120]   does the transcript covers what grades?
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:48.600]   - Usually it's just high school, so nine to 12.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.920]   - Yeah, sometimes people put some eighth grade things
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.600]   on there, but in general,
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.080]   a transcript is really only a record
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.840]   of the last four years, okay?
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.440]   So what about when you need to apply for a job?
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.160]   What kind of document do you use as a record?
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.500]   - I guess it's been a long time since I applied for a job.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.520]   (both laughing)
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.760]   I mean, I remember needing to show my high school diploma,
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.880]   and then there were some, you know,
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   there are some jobs that might want to see a transcript.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.080]   I don't think I ever remember.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.920]   My first job in high school,
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.760]   my first paying job in high school
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.560]   was as a bridal store attendant.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.760]   And I don't think they asked me for anything
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.960]   'cause I was still in high school at that point.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.800]   - Probably not.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.760]   Well, okay, so I remember last time I told you
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.480]   that my husband is looking for a job right now.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.560]   - Yes, yes.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.440]   - Okay, so he has been applying to jobs
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.000]   and he uses a resume, sometimes five, 10 jobs a day.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   - Yes, that's it, yep.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.520]   - So when we, yesterday, I have to tell you
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.440]   this quick thing, this is a little rabbit trail.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.080]   Yesterday, he was told there's an algorithms
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.040]   because he's for nine months been applying
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.840]   to jobs and he doesn't seem to be getting anywhere,
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.520]   but he has a really good resume.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.280]   But evidently there's an algorithm system
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.960]   in AI uses that if your resume doesn't match
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.640]   enough criteria that they doesn't even make it
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.520]   to a human being.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.760]   It's wrong.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.400]   - They flag it based on some criteria.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.240]   Oh my word.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.080]   - Exactly.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.760]   So we didn't, I didn't know that.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   And so having certain things on the resume,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.920]   it's like playing a game.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.560]   You know, he was, someone told us about a AI
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.440]   that actually you can take a job description
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.440]   and your resume, insert it into this AI program
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.960]   and it will spit out your information
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.400]   with all of the right words that will not,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.320]   that will have it pass the--
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.160]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.640]   - Isn't that interesting?
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.480]   - Yes.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.560]   - So sometimes to me, that's like playing a game, right?
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.800]   With I've got, there's not a lot of critical thinking
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.720]   going on.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.400]   It's how can I present myself in a certain way
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.200]   that you'll even have a conversation with me.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.760]   And so a lot of times that's what people think
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.120]   about the transcript.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.320]   And if we were to think about all three
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.440]   of those documents together, a resume, a transcript,
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.520]   a diploma, what do all three of these have in common
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.440]   with one another?
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:37.440]   - A resume, a transcript and a diploma,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.640]   it's supposed to tell something about you.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.360]   It's a way for someone to get to know you,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.240]   maybe to get to know what skills you have,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.080]   what experience you have or what knowledge you have.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.080]   - Okay, so it, does it tell you how to do something,
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.360]   these documents?
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.120]   - No.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.960]   - No.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.780]   - Not really.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.960]   - No, it tells you what you already did, right?
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.240]   - Yeah.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.200]   - It's almost, and it's like that snapshot
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   that we were talking about.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.280]   - Yeah.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.840]   - So both, if you had to give one word
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.520]   to define what all three of these things are,
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.160]   what might word would you choose?
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.000]   - A record.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.400]   - A record, okay, good.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.560]   - A record.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.080]   - A record, I love it.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.280]   So all of these are like the movie trailer,
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.560]   one for, but one is for the high school career
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.660]   and the other is for a professional career.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.280]   Would you agree with that?
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.360]   - Yes, yes.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   - Okay, so let's talk about testing.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.240]   So when, what do you, what image comes into your mind
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.960]   when I use the word testing?
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   - Hmm, well, I'm old, so I'm old school.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.760]   A test to me is about a pencil
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.760]   and a mimeograph or a Xerox copy
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.000]   of a set of questions or problems
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.400]   that a teacher or proctor is presenting to me
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.880]   that I need to respond to or solve.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.720]   - Okay.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.480]   - That's what a test is to me.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.000]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And does that process of taking a test,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.880]   does that, what does it conjure up inside of you
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.720]   when you think about taking tests?
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.280]   - Well, this is really funny.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   When I took tests in subjects that I had loved
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:54.640]   or I had enjoyed the class or I felt really good about,
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.720]   I actually, I was one of those weird people
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.320]   that actually sort of enjoyed taking the test
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.680]   because I love to be able to show myself
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.720]   and the teacher what I knew.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.320]   You know, how my knowledge had grown
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.480]   and how it had become part of me.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.680]   But when I had to take a test in a subject
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.480]   that either intimidated me
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.280]   or I did not feel like I had fully grasped,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.360]   I was anxious and I wanted more than anything
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.920]   for it to be over.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.040]   I think a lot of us can identify with that feeling as well.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.880]   Right?
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.440]   And it's probably because that test,
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.280]   it's gonna point out all the ways in which you failed
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.760]   or don't know something, right?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.600]   - Yep.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.920]   - So what about conversations that you have with people?
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.600]   Have you had conversations that both elicit
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.440]   a positive and a negative with testing?
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.480]   - Oh, sure.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.320]   Sure.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.960]   There are people who always make you feel
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.480]   better about yourself,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.000]   either because they're very interested in what you did
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.600]   or they are
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:14.520]   determined or willing
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.720]   to see the best in you and in the situation.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.320]   And sometimes the people who make you feel the best,
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.560]   when you're having a conversation,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.880]   are the people who are just genuinely interested
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.000]   in what you have to say.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.040]   They don't necessarily have their own agenda.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.960]   They just wanna be with you.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.680]   And they just wanna hear what you know
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.040]   that they could benefit from or become interested in.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.960]   And so that's really good.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.160]   And then there are people that make you feel
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.520]   like you are always running to keep up
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.440]   or that you didn't quite measure up
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.280]   or you didn't maybe do something
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.920]   or see something or answer something
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.840]   quite in the way they would have.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.000]   And that just makes you feel a little anxious
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   or a little less than.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.400]   And nobody likes to feel less than.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.640]   - No, nobody does for sure.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.800]   So can a conversation achieve the same goal as a test?
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.320]   - I think it can in a lot of ways
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.400]   because it can elicit the information
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.880]   or elicit, well, information.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.280]   Like, what do you know?
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.320]   How have you grown?
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.320]   How conversant are you with information?
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.840]   But how have you applied it as well?
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.480]   Are you able to apply it?
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.960]   Have you come to some conclusions on your own?
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.560]   Is there growth in your thinking?
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.200]   - Good.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.080]   So in general, like Lisa, like right now,
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.560]   I don't have a cup of coffee in front of me.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.520]   I should, darn it.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.400]   But I don't.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.120]   But having a conversation with you
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.520]   makes me want to have a cup of coffee.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.520]   It is a pleasant thing every time
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.000]   that we're able to have a conversation.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.400]   Yes, there are times that conversations can generate anxiety
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.680]   especially if you know you're walking
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.400]   into a confrontational conversation.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.520]   But in general, right?
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.080]   Conversations don't in themselves generate anxiety.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.440]   Would you agree?
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.800]   - I do agree.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.960]   I do agree.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.800]   Yep.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.200]   Unless there was something going on.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.400]   I just regular conversations to me are pleasant.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.040]   - Yeah.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.040]   So if conversation can generate a knowledge base
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.480]   of an understanding of someone else's knowledge base
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.280]   just like a test, right?
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.640]   Maybe that we can think about,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.560]   maybe we need to do this assessing thing
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.400]   a little bit differently, right?
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.640]   Because if a person walks into a test,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.960]   how many times have I heard about like anxiety
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.400]   where they have ways in which you can learn
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.840]   how to cope with the anxiety
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.360]   so you can do better on a test?
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   'Cause a lot of times the anxiety itself
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.000]   can actually cause a person to fail a test.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.360]   Not that they didn't know it.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.200]   - Right.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.160]   There are absolutely people who know material
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.600]   but are for whatever reason, poor test takers.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.680]   And so the test is not an accurate assessment
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.840]   of what they know at all.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.600]   I have one child who is a good tester
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.680]   and one who is not,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.520]   for whom I have one child who is a good tester
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.520]   and a test is generally a fairly reliable method
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.280]   of what she knows and how deeply she knows it.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.720]   I have another daughter who is not a great tester
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.800]   and frequently the test is not an accurate measure
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   of how much she interacted and held on to material.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   - Right, right.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.160]   Okay, good.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.080]   'Cause I'm like you,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.000]   I have a child who loves taking tests.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.600]   She thought the first time I ever gave her
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.480]   an end of the year Stanford test,
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.040]   she thought it was the most fun ever.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.760]   And I told her, "Shh, don't say that out loud.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.680]   "You will not be free."
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.280]   (laughing)
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.800]   You know, it does not make you look good.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.640]   But she was that kind of child too
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.720]   where she just enjoyed all the details
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.840]   and things like that and loved to read.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.760]   So it was like, "Ooh, how much have I noticed?"
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.160]   You know, she's my trivia girl.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.440]   She loves trivia.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.840]   - Yes, yes.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.920]   - Yeah, she does.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.960]   She loves it.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.080]   But I have the children who in general,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.160]   they don't like testing.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.640]   And we honestly, as a family,
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.280]   we don't really do that much testing
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.080]   in the whole school world.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.560]   There's some people who do it more
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.640]   and that's a part of their life.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.440]   But mostly, I have learned a different way
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.400]   of assessing using conversation.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.440]   And so if you...
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.680]   Well, let's just say we'll put the word assessment
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.240]   on both a test and a conversation.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.440]   And that's kind of like what the director does in a movie.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.280]   Would you agree?
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.600]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.640]   - So in what ways does the director
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.360]   walking in the skills of assessment in a movie?
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:36.480]   - So I guess that I would say
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   that a director takes into consideration
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.520]   the abilities of his actors
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.720]   and their experience,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.440]   maybe based on their past experiences.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.280]   I imagine that he has seen other work they've done
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.400]   and he knows what they're capable of.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.640]   I also think that the director as an assessor
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.000]   would know how to consider the environment
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.360]   and what he's asking
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.040]   and what role the environment or the setting
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   might have on what the actor is able to give him.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:23.080]   - And so in the middle of a shooting
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.760]   of the part of the movie, right?
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.920]   A scene.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.760]   - Right, right.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.720]   - When the actor doesn't do it
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.520]   the way the director wants it done,
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.840]   what does he usually do?
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.640]   - He says, "Cut."
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   And they're gonna try again.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.480]   And maybe the director would explain,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.840]   well, this is what I thought was gonna happen
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.680]   and I wonder if we could try it a different way, you know?
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   And so I bet that those actors
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.880]   actually are very grateful to those directors.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.960]   - I imagine so too, yeah.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.520]   Don't let me just keep going on in this.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.240]   Yes, I don't want you to let me keep floundering around
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.440]   in this bad way.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.520]   If you know a better way, tell it.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.240]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.960]   And then also the director is able to like celebrate
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.800]   and jump and be excited
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.440]   because it was seen well, right?
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.280]   - Yes, yes.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:26.600]   - Okay, so are transcripts more like directors
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.000]   or movie trailers?
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.000]   - I actually think transcripts are more like movie trailers
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.200]   because they're telling you what's already been done.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.360]   - Right, right.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.040]   And then, so how would you define a transcript
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.640]   in one sentence, a complete sentence?
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:55.040]   - Well, okay, so this is not a refined sentence
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.520]   'cause I'm just doing it out loud.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.080]   I'm not mulling over it a whole lot.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   A transcript is a record of what a student has attempted
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:14.360]   and how well they succeeded in learning.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.560]   - Okay, and what a director does is assess
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:23.280]   and tells us how to get better and how to fix something
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.640]   and also well done, that was really good, right?
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.360]   This is what you did, that was good.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.880]   Well, we call that an assessment.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.000]   So is a transcript then an assessment?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:46.520]   - You know, it's so funny, a transcript to me is different
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.240]   because a transcript is not interactive.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.680]   I mean, it just is, it's a statement of what has happened
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.120]   and it's not an opportunity for me to explain
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.200]   and it's not an opportunity for you to say way to go
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.080]   unless the A has a plus behind it
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.440]   or a way for you to tell what went wrong.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.040]   I mean, you just gotta see.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.000]   The transcript doesn't tell you that, you know,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.400]   that was the semester that my grandma moved in with us
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.680]   or the semester that I had a broken leg
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.320]   and missed three weeks of class, so yeah.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.360]   - Okay, so then if I said a transcript is a summary
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.160]   or a record summarizing their high school career
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.320]   and not an assessment, would you say that's a true statement?
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.520]   - I would say that's true.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.280]   A transcript is in fact a summary
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.720]   of a student's high school education,
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.880]   what courses they took
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.880]   and what assessment they received from it.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.120]   - Okay, so now before you make a movie trailer,
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.320]   what do you have to be focused on?
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.720]   If you have, do you make the movie trailer
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.200]   before you make the movie?
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.760]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.160]   You have to have, well, because you gotta have some footage
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.520]   and hopefully you have already shot the movie
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.840]   and you take the footage for the trailer
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.160]   from what you already finished of the movie.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.440]   - Right, okay, so do all movie trailers
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.400]   accurately portray a movie?
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.560]   - Oh my gosh, I would say no
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.640]   because there are some movie trailers that I get,
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.320]   I think, oh, that's gonna be so good
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.040]   and I get to the movie and I realized
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.560]   that all 45 seconds of the good stuff was in the trailer
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.760]   and the rest of the movie is a snooze fest.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.200]   - Yes, and I've actually seen, because I told you
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.840]   that I probably watch more movie trailers
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.160]   than I ever watch movies.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.120]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.680]   - Enough movie trailers that I didn't,
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.200]   wasn't even pulled into wanting to watch the movie
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.840]   but my kids and they encouraged me to do it
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.160]   'cause they liked it and then it was phenomenal.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.320]   The movie trailer didn't even do a job.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.680]   - Oh my gosh, well, and sometimes the movie trailers
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   are so, the worst one, the worst misdirection to me
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.480]   and this will date me too, but I don't even care.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.400]   When "Pirates of the Caribbean" came out,
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.760]   the movie trailer was there and it just showed
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.440]   the skeletons walking under the sea on the seabed
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.960]   and coming toward people and I was like,
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.280]   oh my word, that's a terrible movie.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.160]   I'm not, that has got to be satanic
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.360]   and it looks like a horror movie.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.520]   I don't have any desire.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.280]   Well, my husband and his friend who,
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   and the two of them always go to bed early,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.880]   they went to like the 10 o'clock movie
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.800]   and my friend and I were just like,
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.720]   okay, these people, A, they're gonna go to sleep
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.560]   and miss the whole thing
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.000]   and B, why are they going to a horror movie?
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.520]   This is not them.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.400]   And then my husband came home and he said,
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.800]   no, no, no, you gotta watch this,
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.040]   there's a different trailer 'cause he saw the movie
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.120]   and he loved it and he came home talking about
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.360]   how great he was and I thought, who's my husband,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.120]   where's my husband and what have we done with him
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.160]   'cause it's not you and he said, no, no, no,
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.120]   you gotta see this other trailer
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.120]   and it was one of the trailers where he said,
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:22.680]   where Barbosa says, oh, I refuse to acquiesce
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.600]   to your request and it was like something about
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.960]   and then there was one that's like,
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.760]   where did the stories come from?
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.400]   That's ironic, isn't it?
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.640]   And I thought, oh my gosh, this is a funny movie.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.240]   This is not a horror movie,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.960]   this is gonna be a funny movie
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.840]   but that was the most,
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.400]   that trailer was most misdirection
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.920]   that I ever experienced in a movie trailer.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.240]   - I mean, and that's the thing is it's whoever's
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.800]   and that's a lot of times movies have multiple trailers
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.440]   because it's who's the audience.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.520]   - Different audiences.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:02.040]   - And so have you, so I guess both of us
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.960]   has been surprised then by movies that were done
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.320]   from the movie trailer.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.040]   So no matter how well a movie trailer is made,
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.280]   it cannot replace the movie.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.120]   - Right.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.040]   - As much as I want to convince my children
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.160]   that I don't need to watch the movie,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.880]   I can just do the trailer because it just takes up
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.560]   so much time to watch a movie.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.400]   - Right.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.920]   - I mean, honestly, I like movies, but really Lisa,
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.000]   I only watch them to relate to my children
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.440]   because they love movies so much.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.960]   That's not my favorite thing.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.400]   - Right, so that you have something to talk to.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.680]   - Yeah, well, or just it's one of their favorite things.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.160]   So it's how we can, you know, but I don't feel,
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.320]   I don't feel like we're relating to each other
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.120]   really a lot in movies.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.880]   Oh, I do have to tell you though this,
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.560]   okay, this is another side trail rabbit,
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.920]   just 'cause I think it's funny.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.920]   My kids, they interact differently in movies than I do.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.800]   And so they would get together with their friends
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.760]   and they watch movies as a group, right?
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.440]   So then, so you know that movie, "The Quiet Place"?
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.120]   - Yes, oh my word, yes.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.040]   - Right?
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.560]   So I had not seen that movie.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   They watched it with their group, with their friends,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.200]   and they were like, "Mom, this is such a good movie."
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.560]   I'm like, "I don't do horror movies."
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.120]   And they're like, "No, mom, it's not a horror movie.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:21.960]   You'll like it."
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.800]   - Right, me too.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.640]   I was like, "I don't wanna see it.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.480]   I don't wanna see it."
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.720]   - And they were like, "No, come on, do it."
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.640]   I said, "Okay, fine."
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.240]   So they talked me into it.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.760]   So we're watching it as a family and it's dark
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.360]   and it's in our basement.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   And I have a very strict no talking policy in a movie, okay?
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.320]   - Yes, yes.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.640]   - So I cannot stand it when my kids talk
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.040]   and I'm like, "Oops, nope, no talking."
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:45.880]   And so-
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.280]   - That's right, I'm gonna miss that dialogue, yeah.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.320]   - (laughs) And so then at one point, my kids,
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.800]   I told them, "I can't do this anymore, turn it off."
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.200]   And I turned it off 'cause it was too scary for me.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.760]   And my kids were like, "Mom, it was not scary
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.640]   when we watched it before,
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.400]   but it's really scary when it's quiet."
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.240]   (laughs)
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   - Oh my God, that's hilarious.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.680]   - I know, because they, I didn't realize
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.560]   that when they watch movies, I said,
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.800]   "Wait, what are you talking about?"
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.400]   They were like, "No, we just make jokes the entire time
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.000]   and talk while the movie's going on."
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.840]   So we didn't-
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.240]   - So you miss all the reasons it's scary, hello?
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.040]   - Yes, but my point, you know, it's like,
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.280]   they have an entirely different experience watching it.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   - Yes. - They're social
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.240]   in watching movies.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.720]   So I choose to be social with them,
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.120]   even though I don't let them talk.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.480]   I know they love it and we talk about it afterwards,
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:43.320]   you know, so anyway, so, but I have to say
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.600]   that when you watch a trailer, a movie trailer,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.760]   we know that the movie has to be made first.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.600]   - Yeah.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:54.160]   - You must be focused on making a movie good
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   before you ever even try to make a movie trailer.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.000]   - Yes, yes.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.880]   - The movie trailer is the easy part.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.200]   If you just take, you just have to make a good movie
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:12.040]   and just pull snapshots out of that story
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.040]   to put it together, to summarize the story itself
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.320]   in a short two minutes, right?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.280]   There's not a lot of, there is,
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:26.320]   there is a good way and a bad way to make a trailer.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.200]   We can all agree on that.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.640]   But if the movie is bad,
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.280]   no matter how good the trailer looks,
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.440]   it will not replace a bad movie.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   So as homeschoolers, I would say that we need
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.080]   to change the question from how do I make a transcript
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   to how do I classically educate and assess my student?
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.240]   A transcript is not an assessment,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.720]   but we use that word as if it is an assessment.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.640]   Making a transcript is just a snapshot.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.320]   And yes, there is an art
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.040]   to how to make one better than another.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.000]   However, if I have seen it over and over, Lisa,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.220]   and I bet you can attest to this too,
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.880]   that parents come into the high school years,
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.600]   seventh, eighth grade,
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.920]   and they will change how they are homeschooling
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.040]   so that they can fit their homeschooling
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.160]   into what a transcript should look like.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.540]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.480]   - And that's the wrong way to look at it, right?
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.960]   Because what we have here is let's be focused
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.760]   on doing what is good and right that blesses your children,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.520]   blesses you, that builds a love of learning into the student.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.760]   Do not change and go.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.480]   Like I have that verse in my mind right now that says,
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.440]   do not turn to the left and do not turn to the right,
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.720]   but stay moving forward on the path
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.640]   that I have for you, right?
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   And so the transcript should not ever be something
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.520]   in which you are altering your education decisions
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.600]   to mold to a transcript.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.080]   And so I would like to encourage our listeners
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   that you crafting a transcript, that's the easy part.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.160]   You know, my website classicaltoolsforchange.com
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.640]   is the number four.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.600]   You go there, I can help you craft a transcript.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.260]   I can do a private consultation,
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:42.920]   but you could take my class and that class itself
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.280]   is going to teach you how to assess classically.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.600]   And it doesn't take long.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.680]   If you focus on the movie,
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.200]   then it does not take long to walk through
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.520]   how to put those pieces into a transcript.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.660]   Less than an hour, it does not take long.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.760]   But a lot of that-
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.600]   - Because it's just a tool.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.120]   It's just a tool for showing,
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.540]   for displaying what is good about the education
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.580]   you and your child produced.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.360]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.520]   And I just want to encourage each of you
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:22.060]   that to stay strong and to know that this piece,
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.640]   oh, I have an idea.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.560]   Okay, I'm just gonna use another, I love metaphors.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.200]   But if another way to look at it, right?
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.880]   Like Lisa, if I didn't know you
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.680]   and I walked into a party, like a dinner party
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.300]   and I say, hi, my name is Rachel.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.200]   And you say, hi, my name is Lisa.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.760]   And I have a natural, I'm curious about people.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.960]   And I would say, Lisa, tell me about yourself, right?
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.600]   Like, tell me about who are you?
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.480]   Where are you from?
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.560]   What do you do?
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.520]   What kind of people are in your, that are around you?
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.800]   What kind of books do you like to read?
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.260]   And after we've had this really great conversation
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.440]   for an hour, I am not gonna look at you and say,
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.120]   I would like to know what authority that you have.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.440]   Or I'm not gonna question the pieces of your story.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.940]   Does that make sense?
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:13.780]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.500]   - And so a lot of times people think
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.560]   that the transcript is this document
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.560]   that someone is going to question
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.280]   all the pieces that are on there.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.120]   And they're like, well, I don't wanna fail my student.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.120]   I don't want them to not get
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.680]   and be able to do what they wanna do
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.480]   because I have failed them in some kind of way.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.000]   But the truth of the matter is,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   if it truly is just a snapshot of your child's story,
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.500]   who is going to argue with that?
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.340]   Nobody.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.060]   - Absolutely, nobody.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.780]   - Nobody is gonna argue with that.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:53.420]   And I'm telling you what, the transcript,
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.660]   it doesn't matter if it is from a public school,
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.700]   a private school, or a homeschool parent.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.880]   It is subjective, completely subjective
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.740]   to whomever put those pieces together.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:11.220]   There is no grade given by any instructor anywhere.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.060]   - Right.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:15.020]   - That was not subjective, right?
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.720]   So that's why we have to,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.720]   we can go all into grades.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.340]   Today's not the day for that,
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.720]   but I would love for you to take my class to hear,
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.720]   we talk about what is a grade?
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.580]   How do I grade, right?
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:36.580]   What is this letter that's supposed to imply good or bad?
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.640]   Nobody thinks so much about the B or the C.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.800]   Those are just those average letters, right?
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.280]   That the A is the good one, the F is the bad one,
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.400]   and you're only averaging.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   Well, that is not something that I wanna be identified with.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.600]   And I don't think that my own student
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.360]   wants to be identified by a letter, right?
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.480]   However, we live in a world
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.320]   in which that is how we have to communicate.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.800]   So when I go over to Italy,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.600]   and I talk to an Italian,
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:15.960]   and they are, we're talking and I have to translate.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.040]   So I have to take what I know in English,
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.800]   and I have to learn how to translate that in Italian
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.880]   to express what I know and understand.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.480]   So my vocabulary is really limited in Italian.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.760]   And I sometimes like when I'm talking to my Italian friends,
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   I only have like a 30 minute level of vocabulary.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.960]   And it's always the same kind of conversation, right?
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.000]   Well, a lot of that is the same,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.360]   you need to understand the language
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.640]   in which you're translating it in,
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.760]   and you need to understand the audience
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.720]   in which is going to receive
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.080]   the message you're trying to express.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.480]   And the same is with the transcript.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   If our audience is a governing body or a university,
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.560]   or a, I don't know what some of the others
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.440]   that we mentioned, right?
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.280]   A college or a local, whatever agency, right?
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.880]   That needs to look at your transcript.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.680]   A classical education,
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.800]   you have to learn how to translate that
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   into a language that a university can understand.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.760]   Right, and so there is a form to it,
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   there is a language to a transcript that you need to learn.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.520]   But what you really, it's the in between part,
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.400]   how do I bridge this education I'm not willing to sacrifice,
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.880]   I'm not willing to change,
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.080]   how do I communicate that or translate it
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.720]   into a one page record that is a summary
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:00.560]   of my children's high school so that they can understand
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.240]   what my children know or don't know.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.080]   And honestly, it's like that algorithm
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.360]   with my husband's job and how he's making resumes in.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.280]   - Yep.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.320]   - Sometimes you just have to know how to write the transcript
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.240]   so that it can go past the algorithm or AI
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.840]   of universities and colleges, if you will,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.880]   so that you can have an interview,
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.280]   so that you can have a conversation
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.960]   where someone can actually assess or write an essay
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.440]   where somebody can actually read your thoughts
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.200]   that can express in a more accurate way
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.560]   what you know and what you don't know.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.920]   - That's so great.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.320]   - It's important for us to know how to write transcripts,
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.400]   we cannot change that.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:53.400]   But if we understand what a transcript actually is,
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.240]   then we can focus where we need to focus,
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.040]   which is on how to make a good movie
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:04.520]   or how rather how to educate my child
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.120]   so that they can know God and make him known,
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.120]   not so that they can get into a college,
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.960]   not so that they can make money down the road.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.440]   But like you said, I loved your response, right?
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.160]   Of, well, I really want my audience,
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.000]   the audience of my child's educational life to be God,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   right? - Yeah.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.680]   - Fear God and none other.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.720]   Do not fear man.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.160]   Oh, and the thing, you know, the thing about fearing God
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.640]   is that it's like Aslan from "The Lion, the Witch
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.080]   and the Wardrobe."
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.120]   That, is it the beaver that says--
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   - Yes.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.120]   - You remember, what did he say?
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.720]   I forget his line.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.200]   - Is he scary?
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.160]   - It's like, he's good.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.000]   - Oh, wild, I just remembered, is he wild?
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.680]   - Is he wild, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.960]   - Or is he a tame lion and what is the beaver say?
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:01.800]   Do you remember?
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.520]   - It's such a good, I don't want to misquote it.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.360]   I'm like you, Rachel, I don't want to misquote it.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.520]   - We're thinking out loud together
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.600]   'cause I'm trying to remember too.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.480]   So I think it went something like,
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.320]   is it a tame lion or a wild lion?
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.360]   He's like, is it a tame lion?
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.800]   No, it's not a tame lion, but it's a good lion.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.040]   - It's a good lion.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:24.880]   - It's a good lion.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:25.720]   - Yeah.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.480]   - And that's the way that, I totally butchered that
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.000]   and you, "Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe."
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.480]   - I think it's not tame, he's not tame, but he's good.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.800]   He's not tame, but he's good.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.440]   - And that is kind of how with God,
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.960]   like God is the all-powerful God.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.520]   And he says, "Fear no one but me."
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.680]   But the beauty is that he's good.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.520]   - Yeah.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.320]   - He's good and he loves us.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.600]   And when we are afraid of man,
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.440]   it can make us fear, think that God is not good,
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.960]   that I need to get approval and validation from man.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.440]   And really all that matters is,
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.040]   "Well done, my good and faithful servant.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.520]   "You are my daughter and I love you."
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.520]   And when I know him and learn his voice
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.080]   and education helps me know him,
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:26.080]   it does help me to hear his voice and to see connections,
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:31.320]   to see the world around me and how it reflects the beauty
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.120]   and the goodness and the truth of who he is, right?
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.120]   That's one aspect that helps open my mind to him.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.240]   But if I'm focusing on that
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.640]   and he truly is my main audience,
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.600]   and as a parent, if that's who I want my main audience
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.320]   for it to be for my children,
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:51:00.160]   then we cannot alter how we educate our children
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.760]   simply because of a transcript.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.680]   - You're right.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.160]   - And I am so thankful for you
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.440]   to just give us this opportunity today
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.680]   to have this conversation
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.880]   and to talk about the beauty of who God is
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:20.800]   and how the transcript fits into that story that you have.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.120]   - This has been great.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:27.120]   And I think a very valuable thinking exercise
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.680]   for all of us that really ought to always
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:37.800]   be the prerequisite for building a transcript
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.880]   for our children, because we get our thoughts in order,
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:45.520]   we get our heart straight, we get our priorities right,
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:50.400]   and then we look back and build the transcript.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.160]   The transcript doesn't drive the education.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.160]   The education provides the script for the transcript.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.760]   - Beautiful. - I love that.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.520]   - I love that too. - I love that.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.040]   - Well, I have to tell you, Lisa,
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.360]   this experience of doing this podcast with you
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.320]   has been so much fun.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.280]   It's been my first time able to do a podcast,
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.760]   so much that it has inspired me to start my own podcast.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.360]   - Oh, tell us about it, 'cause you would be somebody
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.560]   that my listeners would love to know.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.560]   - Yes, okay.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.280]   Well, it's gonna be called the Worker Bee Podcast,
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.840]   adding honey to the hive, one podcast at a time.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.320]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.800]   - I'm like, it was really fun, came to me in prayer.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.840]   And the honey, it makes me think of a verse,
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.600]   Psalm 119, I think, 103, where it's like,
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.280]   "Taste and see that your words are honey,"
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.560]   or like, "They are sweeter to me than honey."
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.560]   And I love hearing and talking about truth,
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.760]   about goodness, about beauty.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.560]   And so it will be just a podcast
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.800]   where we can jump into lots of different conversations.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.840]   And of course, as a home educator and a teacher,
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:03.840]   there will be literary discussions and metaphor pictures.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.720]   All of those will definitely come into play,
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.960]   but it's gonna just flow as God leads.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.920]   So I'm excited, and I just wanted to say thank you
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.120]   for opening the door for me to be able
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.480]   to step into this world of podcasting,
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.080]   and we'll just get to go on a journey and play with it.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:23.840]   But I also want to be able to let you guys know
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.760]   that I will be featuring a free one-hour class.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.720]   You can go to classicaltoolsforchange.com
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.320]   and be able to register for that free class.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.440]   There is a limit of 30 people who can jump on.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:42.320]   But if you liked today's conversation,
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.160]   it will be the same kind of conversation.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:50.040]   It will help the audience to walk on a journey
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.120]   of discovering what the transcript truly is.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.880]   And I want to just bless you and your family,
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.920]   but it's an interactive conversation.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.440]   So come ready to talk the way Lisa and I
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.400]   have been able to talk today.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.200]   And then that is gonna be a lead-in
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.360]   to the next assessment class
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.040]   that I teach called Tools for Transcripts.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.760]   And that is where the first five hours
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:20.200]   are us learning and focusing on what assessment is,
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.760]   and how to assess classically,
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.160]   and how to assess what your students know.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.840]   Because if you're like me,
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.400]   maybe you waited till your child was in the 10th
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.360]   or 11th grade, or even the 12th grade.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.080]   And you're like, how am I supposed to go back
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.920]   and figure out what they know and what they don't.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.240]   - And remember all of this.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.920]   - And so that's the kind of assessment
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.880]   we are gonna be focused on,
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.280]   is learning how to sit and converse with our student
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.440]   so that you can figure out what holes are there,
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.800]   or if they actually know a subject,
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.920]   how well do they know it?
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.840]   And how do I then translate that onto a transcript?
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.080]   And we spend the last hour, hour and a half
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.600]   walking through actually how to craft a transcript.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.040]   And I will go step by step,
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.880]   and then I can help you.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.600]   Maybe you take that class and you're like,
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.800]   I still just need help.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   I've had people, and I sit with you one by one.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.280]   People have done it for me,
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.000]   and I want to do it for others where I can guide you.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.600]   Who is my student?
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.240]   What have they done?
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   How can we move forward in this process as a director?
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:34.400]   Needing to decide what do I want this to look like
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:38.200]   as God has put me as a steward over my children's education?
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.040]   So join us.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.720]   The next class I have for that is gonna be in February.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.960]   You can get all the details on our website.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.080]   And again, I just thank you, Lisa, for this opportunity.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.400]   - Oh, this has been great.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.760]   - It has been so fun.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.520]   I really appreciate it.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.840]   I have enjoyed it.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.280]   And I know that you have blessed us all
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.840]   by helping us perhaps turn assessment
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.480]   and the whole idea of transcript
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   and judging our children's education.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.480]   You've helped us turn that on its head
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.080]   and put it in a right perspective.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.760]   And Rachel, I appreciate that.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.200]   Listeners, you check the show notes.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:19.000]   It will remind you of those times
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   for classes and other opportunities to hear from Rachel.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.600]   Rachel, thank you so much.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.800]   And listeners, I'll see you next week.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.640]   Bye-bye.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.720]   (gentle music)
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.780]   you
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.840]   you
