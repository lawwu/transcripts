[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [intro music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Alright, so speaking of Deep Living and Productivity, this is the first show that we are recording
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   in March of 2022. So, as is our tradition, I wanted to do a segment in which I go through
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   the books I read during the previous month. So, the books I read in February 2022.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   As long-time listeners of the show know, I typically aim to read five books per month.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I count books in the month in which I finish them.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   So, you have to break that symmetry somehow. That is how I break it.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I'll say, Jesse, this was a weird reading month for me. I have some unusual choices.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   It was an unusual month and I was grabbing stuff kind of randomly. So, you'll see, as will the listeners here.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Alright, so let's start with the first book I read in the month. I just grabbed this out of a little free library
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   here in Tacoma Park and read it in a day or two. It was not a long book.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   It was called Living with a Seal by Jesse Itzler. It is a book where Jesse Itzler, who is an entrepreneur,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   among other things, I think he worked with like NetJets or one of these jet leasing. Do you know him?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I've read the book, yeah.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   You've read the book, okay. So, anyways, he hired who turns out to be David Goggins,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   though it's not revealed in the book, to live with him for a month and make him do these terrible intense workouts.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And so, it was interesting. I was interested. I find Goggins to be an interesting character, so I read the book.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I will say, and I don't know how to say this without, this is going to sound a little bit snobbish,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   but I'm not that used to this style of ultra accessible nonfiction.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So, there's this style of ultra accessible nonfiction where the chapters are three or four pages long
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and it moves at a really fast rate and it's, I don't want to say it's superficial,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   but it's just we did this and that and this and it's very compulsively readable.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And I think this book sold really well. And what I realized, and again, there's no way to talk about this
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   without sounding like a super snob, is that there's a whole genre of nonfiction that's made to be very accessible,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   very short chapters. It moves really fast. It's sort of the opposite, I guess, of some of the nonfiction worlds
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   in which I swim. And so, that was an interesting part about reading this book, was saying,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   oh, there is this sort of bubblegum nonfiction world out there. And I think it's good.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's what I was exposed to. It was an interesting book. All right. Another book I read was Susan Casey's
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   latest, Voices in the Ocean. So, Susan Casey wrote The Devil's Teeth, which I really like.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   This is a book about the, what do they call it, the Faroe or Farallon Islands off of San Francisco.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Anyways, it's one of the great white shark hot spots in the world.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's just surrounded by great white sharks. They're attracted by the seals, and there's researchers out there
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   who study them. And she went out there, and it's about the sharks and about the research.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   That was great. She wrote The Wave, which I really like, which is about large waves.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   But half of the book is her following Laird Hamilton to do big wave surfing. That's another fantastic book.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Anyway, she has this style where what she does is goes on adventures. She meets interesting people
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and goes and does interesting things and uses that as the narrative spine for writing about a topic
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   like great white sharks or large waves. So this was about dolphins. Voices in the Ocean is about dolphins.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And so she goes on various adventures. She goes to travel to see various places where dolphins
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   are being held in captivity. She goes to the Solomon Islands where there is a dolphin trading going on,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   and it's a little bit shady. She likes to put herself in the semi-danger as part of these books.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   She goes to that Japanese city featured in the documentary The Cove, where they push these dolphins
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   into this cove, and they slaughter them, and she goes there. So it was an interesting book.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Now, I'll tell you the reason why I actually read this book, and so this was a bit of a disappointment,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   is I'm interested in Susan's story herself. So Susan was a very successful magazine editor.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So she went and she took over, I believe, Outside Magazine and really helped their reinvention
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   back when they were starting to win all those national book awards. This is the Krakauer era
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   of Outside Magazine. And then Oprah tapped her to run the Oprah Magazine. Oh, the Oprah Magazine,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and that did really well under her tutelage. So she had a very intense corporate job running these magazines,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and then she would write these books sort of in parallel, and it reminded me of myself trying to write books
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   while doing these other things I do. And what happened to Susan is she burnt out at some point,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   said, "Enough of this. Step down from those running-the-magazine-type positions and move to Maui,"
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and lives there at least half the year and spends a lot of time swimming in the ocean.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   She's really into the ocean with dolphins or this or that. I thought that story was going to be in this book
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   because I know this book was connected to her making that change, but I think she made the change
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   after she finished the book. So unfortunately, I did not get in the book those insider stories
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   of the overworked author shifting to a deeper, simpler life, but I enjoyed the book nonetheless.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Then this was just random. I grabbed this from my library of Mice and Men, Steinbeck.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I just realized, I don't know if I've ever read Steinbeck or haven't read Steinbeck since high school,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   and I saw the book in my library. It was a copy from the '60s, and so I grabbed it and read it.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It was quite interesting. This, by the way, is an argument for having a library.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I know there is a minimalist movement out there surrounding books that says, "Come on, don't hold on the books.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Why are you holding on the books? It's clutter. You're never going to read them."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I actually go old school. I have a large library spread over many rooms and many bookshelves
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and actually many buildings. I have a library here at the HQ and multiple rooms full of books at my house.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I like the idea of having—I go to my shelves and I pull books off and I read them, and I think this is an example.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I grabbed Steinbeck off the shelf and I hadn't read it yet, and I did.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I would say usually at least two of the five books I read each month are grabbed serendipitously from my personal library.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I like the idea that my kids are growing up just surrounded by books.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Of Meissenmann, it was good. It was good. It's interesting because it's old enough that the style—
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   there was so much formal innovation in fiction that took off not long after that earlier period of Steinbeck
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   that it seems almost old-fashioned, right? That it's largely third-person perspective,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   just observing on the characters, establishing characterization almost entirely through dialogue and action.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And it just feels like, "Oh, this is just old-fashioned, old-school style for novels,"
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   but Steinbeck is very good at the style and it sticks with you.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   He does very interesting characterization through dialogue and action, and when it's over, it sticks with you.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   So it's interesting. So there's no formal flash in it.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   All of the modernist stuff that followed and then the postmodernist stuff that followed that in terms of formal innovation,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   it has none of that, right? I mean, Faulkner started doing his modernist stuff so quickly after this period,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and then you get the postmodernist doing their stuff with fiction after this, and you get Pynchon and all these other writers
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   that all took off after mid-century. So it was old-fashioned, but it was—you heard it here first.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Steinbeck is a good writer. There you go.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   All right. Then I read a book by Boyd Vardy called Cathedral of the Wild.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So Boyd was actually a guest on Tim Ferriss' show, and that's actually what brought this book to my attention.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So that worked. He was on the show, and I bought his memoir. So that worked out well.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Did you hear that episode, Jesse, the lion tracking?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Yeah, right? It's an interesting guy, right?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I've listened to all of his episodes for the most part.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Right. So I listened to Boyd on Ferriss and then said, "I got to get this guy's memoir."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And crazy. You might like this book, Jesse, because I've been watching this series Yellowstone on Paramount+ or wherever it is,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and it's the story of this ranch family or this or that. And I was thinking, "Forget that.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Someone needs to make a series about the Vardy family's life." It's this crazy story.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So their South African and his grandparents, I believe, bought this land that was considered worthless in eastern South Africa.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It had been overgrazed, and so you couldn't really farm on it anymore.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And they basically created one of the first wildlife preserves that was set up around sustainable safari.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And they figured out how to do that, how to rejuvenate the land so that animals could come back to it,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and you could have a diverse ecosystem of animals, and then support it by doing ecotourism.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   So people could come and do what they call photo safari, where then you could—
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   tourists would pay a lot of money to come take pictures of these animals, and that helps fund the recovery of the land.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   But their story is crazy. I mean, this is a story where he has stories of getting attacked by a crocodile.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The crocodile trying to pull him in, and he was just lucky enough that his foot was in the crocodile's mouth,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   and he hit inside the crocodile's mouth whatever valve they breathe through.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And as a reflex, the crocodile spit it back out. There's black mambas crawling over his body.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Him and his dad are sitting there. No one can move, because if you get bit by the mamba, you're dead in 30 minutes.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Crawling across their bodies, like looking at them, and then crawling away.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Nelson Mandela, this is where he came after being released from prison on Robbins Island.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   This was the reserve he came to to recharge and reflect, and they have all of these stories of being there with Mandela on their preserve,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   watching as he's figuring out how to bring South Africa back together.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   There's stories about them desperately trying to get a radio phone going,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   because there was a brief revolution attempt by right-wing elements in South Africa that was happening, and he was at their preserve.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   All of this happens at the same place. Crazy stories like, Jesse, you probably heard on the Ferris podcast about the flying adventures.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   They would fly these bush planes around, and the stork that crashed through the windshield of the plane,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   and the pilot had a stork head and neck sticking out of his head.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It went into his head, and so the pilot passes out. The dad takes over the plane.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   The pilot finally comes through, pulls the stork beak out of his head, passes out again.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   The mom is in the back reading the checklist for them to land.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   They're covered in gore and feathers. The windshield's broken open. They land the plane.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   They're flying to the commercial airport, and they land, and they go on and get on their commercial flight.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Yeah, walk down the aisle.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So anyways, I thought it was great. I actually read it. We were on vacation down in Florida,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   and we were going to some wildlife preserves and stuff like that, so I was reading it down there.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   But it's just, I've never heard, or I've rarely heard a more interesting memoir.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   If someone does not own the rights, the film rights or the series rights to this life, get on it,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I think it would be a fantastic show, and he's a really interesting guy.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I mean, you heard the Ferris interview. Have you ever been more jealousy-induced than the opening of that interview
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   where Tim asked Boyd Vardy, "All right, so where are you right now?"
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And he's like, "Okay, I'm in this cabana on our property, and I'm looking out the window at a bau-bau tree,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   and there's a cheetah in the tree, and I can see elephants walking by the river,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   down by the river below," or something like that. I was like, "Okay, that guy wins."
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   He's got a good voice too. I bet you his audio book is good.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. Maybe I should have listened to it.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I looked up their place, by the way. I think the dollar is relatively strong against the rand,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and so I thought it would be crazy expensive. I mean, if you look at it now, it's super luxury now,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   like really nice, beautifully appointed, but you can rent your own villa,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and it's like $1,000-something US dollars a night, which, that's a lot of money,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   but not a lot of money for being in a luxury... I mean, the villa I was looking at has like a dock almost.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   It comes out of it. It comes out of the villa, and it's up above a riverbank,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   and there's a bathtub at the end of it. So you can take a bath in the bathtub,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   and the elephants walk by in the river right below it.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   That in Miami would be like $10,000 a day.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Yeah, yeah, exactly. Because I was in Florida, I was like, oh, yeah, $1,000 a day would be like entry stakes
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   for like a reasonable resort. So maybe we'll do that for episode 200.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   We're going to go to Void Vardy's Safari down in South Africa.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I don't know how many South African fans we have, but maybe we could gather a crew.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   You can see the headlines now. Minor podcaster from D.C. killed by black mamba
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   trying to take a bath near elephants. That would be the headline.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   All right, that's four. What was my fifth book?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Oh, and then I also read a techno-criticism book by Jacob Ward that just came out that's called The Loop.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   These are just the type of topics I keep up on in my semi-academic role when I comment on and think and write about tech and culture.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Jacob Ward wrote this book called The Loop. Jacob Ward's a science writer, technology writer,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   that focuses on the ways that artificial intelligence can create these feedback loops with the human brain,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   especially the natural biases and heuristics that the human brain already uses,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   the type of things that you see Danny Kahneman talk about, for example.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Kahneman shows up a lot in this book.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And Ward's argument or concern is that we have these biases and heuristics that we use to sort of simplify how we think about the world,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   and those can get stuck in a feedback loop with AI, which exploits them.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And then that feeds back to the AI, which feeds back into those biases,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and then the AI itself can actually push human behavior into ways that are actually pretty distant
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   from how we might actually want to live or what we actually value.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   So he's worried about these tight feedback loops between the human subconscious bias and artificial intelligence.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And so that's, it's always a, look, all these topics are interesting.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I thought it was an interesting book.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I don't know that there was a knockout blow of an argument in this particular one,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   but I'm glad that people are looking at these, looking at these issues.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   AI is definitely, definitely on my radar.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I'm not quite sure exactly how I think about it yet, but good book.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   All right, so those are my five.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   You know, Jesse, someone asked me, they said, "When you do your books,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   we'd like to hear something that Jesse's reading too, so I'm putting you on the spot,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   but I know you're doing an interesting reading project right now.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Maybe you'd want to share what the project is you're working on with the Wars
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   and maybe mention one of the books you read recently."
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   You mean Neil Stephenson?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Weren't you doing a project where you were reading, like trying to read a book from every major,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   about every major war?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Oh, no, that wasn't me.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   That wasn't you. Who was doing that?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Maybe one of your students.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Maybe one of my students.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   I was thinking about starting to get into some of the, you know, the World War II and World War I,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   and you mentioned the one book about--
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Maybe that's the conversation we had.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Okay.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I haven't started that yet.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I've been kind of reading a bunch of Neil Stephenson stuff, and then I'm also reading a book
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   on John Thompson, the former--
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Sure.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   He went to Carroll High School.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   That's cool.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And then I'm reading a book.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I bounce around a lot like you do, too.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   I picked up the Sisson book from last week, so I've dived into some of that.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   The Primal Blueprint?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And then there's a book that I found on Amazon just about how people, like in Congress,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   like fought all the time back in the day, like maliciously fought.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Yeah, we talked about that.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So I'm like diving into that.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Yeah, we always think things are worse, but--
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   It was bad back then.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   They got killed.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   They got killed.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   And like that cane beating was really serious that happened to lead up to the Civil War.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   It took that guy two years to recover.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   You just beat him with a cane.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   The interesting thing about Stephenson is--Neil Stephenson's books is he--I'm listening to
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   one on audio, reading one, and then have another on hard copy, but the one on audio is before
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   the one that I'm reading, and their characters, some of the characters carry over.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   So what are the two?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Reamde and then the Fall.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So Reamde was first, I think.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And it must be because Zul is older in the Fall.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Which one--
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And then Fall's when Dodge dies.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Which one has--so the Fall, is this the one where there's a--it's like a heaven-type world,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   but it's virtual?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   The Fall is Dodge dies, and they're trying to save his brain.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   By the way, spoiler alert.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   They try to save his brain.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   So I'm kind of in that part where--and then there was that fake nuclear thing.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   And they can upload people's--is this the right book where they can upload people's into the
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   virtual world or something like this?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Probably.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   It's probably getting to that point, because I'm only 25% in.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   The last Stephenson book I read was Seven Eves.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I'm reading that, too.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   That's a cool book.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   That's a fun book.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   I read that on vacation.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   The moon blows up, and a hard rain is supposed to come.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   The moon blows up, and the world gets destroyed, and yeah, it's interesting.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Here's the thing about You'll See When You Get to the End of It is I love the Stephenson,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   you know, let's work through the details.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Like, he has that Andy Weir instinct of, like, let's work through some details, but then
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   he also has, like, the Ursula K.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Gwynn instinct of I really care about people and characters in a way that, like, Andy Weir,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   you know, does not.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And so he has that mix of really interesting characters, but he takes his time and unfolds
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   the story, and it's interesting and captivating.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Then you'll see when you get towards the end of the book, it's like he ran out of time.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   He's like, and then it was like a lot of years later, and this was going on, and surprise,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   and a couple spoilers, and we're out.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   So it's this, I think, really interesting unfolding story.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And I like the Neil deGrasse Tyson character.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   You know, the scientist that goes up in the space.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   It was based off of Neil.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I just finished No Crash, too, like a couple weeks ago.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Man, that's the life.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I mean, I know it's hard.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   We talked about Brandon Sanderson last week, but creating fiction and not literary fiction,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   because I think that is when you're doing literary fiction.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I think so brutal because it's so fickle, and it's so like you're trying to create art.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And like, if it doesn't go right, it's just brutal, and the whole thing can disappear.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And but if you're Stevenson, you know what you're about.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   It's not like I have to get the National Book Award for this, and the or like the Booker
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Prize, or people are going to think I'm dumb, my career falls apart.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And it's like, no, I'm going to I know the type of thing I write, and I can experiment.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It's interesting, and my fans love it, you know.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And then just he lives in Seattle and has this cool house by the water, and they just sit
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   and write these interesting, cool books with a fan base that likes them.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And that's the main thing you do.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   That's the dream, I think.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   He comes up with so much stuff.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I like that guy.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   I mean, he I was reading the Wikipedia thing on Snow Crash, and he had a code for like
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   two years to like get it all right in his head for me.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   He could write the book.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   That's the man.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   That'd be the dream.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Live somewhere cool.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Stevenson needs a cooler place to live, though.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   He has like a traditional house in like a suburb of Seattle.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   He needs like a compound somewhere.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   But live somewhere cool and think really deeply about one idea, and then compose these books,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   and they come out on your schedule.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   And he's such a curmudgeon.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Like he he he book tours reluctantly, and not that long, and then goes back to write.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I mean, I know he did some stuff with Blue Origin and Magic Leap.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Like he's done some consulting stuff.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   But Sanderson, Martin, all these all these guys, Andy Weir.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It's kind of cool to like reading the fiction, then you're walking around in real life reality,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and you just think certain things because you have this fiction in your mind.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Like the other day when you're like, oh, something bad's going to happen.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I was like, oh, hard rain in the back of my mind.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Jesse's prepping for the hard rain.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I don't know if it's worth prepping for.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   It seems like you didn't have a lot of options there.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Like you could have gone in the space where, spoiler alert, things don't go well.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Or there's the people who buried themselves underground.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   All right.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Well, anyways, those are those are the books.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Those are my books for February and a couple from Jesse as well.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   So keep reading and we'll check in next month with the five books I read in March.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   By the way, I'm about two down right now.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   So I have three books to go in March.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I mean, almost two.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   I'm almost done with the second.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   So we got three books to go.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I'm also reading a really big, long book that I don't know how to count this
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   because I'm not going to finish it in a month.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   It's 800 pages long and hard.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   But what I'm thinking I'm going to do is in addition to the five books I report,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I'm going to start reporting progress on this big book.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   That's a good idea.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Because it's broken up.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Because you've talked about it several times.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And it's broken up into eight smaller books inside of it.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   So I might just I won't count it as one of my books, but I'll say I read, you know,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   books two through three of this big book this month because I have to get going in it.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I just I got to get that momentum going.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   The other thing about books in general that you mentioned to me offline was how one of your editors said that you don't read enough.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   I found that amazing.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   I think your audience might want to hear that story.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Well, enough literature, enough literature.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Now, granted, this is someone with a graduate degree in literature from a very good school.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   He correctly points out I don't let's put it this way.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   I do not think that he has recently read Jesse Itzler's Living with a Seal.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So I think he thinks I need to read more literature.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And he's right.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I need if I'm going to be I'm doing thinking and commentary and cultural discussion to have that common cultural heritage of really smart people in our literary heritage.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I need that to be better.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   So this big, long book I'm reading is a classic.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   I need to read.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I've read a fair amount of the classics, but I want to make that more a part of my regular routines.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   I'll report back on that success, but I want to read more classics.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   So more on that.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   More on that soon.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Nice.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Thanks.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   [Music.]
