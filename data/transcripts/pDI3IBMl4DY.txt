[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:16.160]   somebody on the pod somebody's got coved it it it it's not the me oh you're ruining the game java
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.280]   oh sorry so here's the game person who got coven have they been vaccinated or not okay all four of
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.560]   us have been vaccinated we covered that on our previous pod so everybody's been vaccinated
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.960]   double vaxxed everybody's been double vaxxed did we all get pfizer i was pfizer pfizer pfizer pfizer
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.760]   okay so pfizer across the board we got quads and this is a breakthrough infection has anybody
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.480]   taken a z-pack after a night of partying
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.840]   i have oh my god

[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.640]   this bestie got a breakthrough infection outdoors at a restaurant number one got it outdoors number
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.040]   two got it from somebody who was also vaccinated number three this bestie does not fly commercial
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:20.080]   and he's not a fan of being interrupted and he is not an evangelical david the breakthrough
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.440]   vaccination david sacks
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.080]   i'm glad that we got that
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.680]   i'm glad that uh my getting a breakthrough case of covet is uh is comedy fodder for you somehow
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.360]   let your winners ride
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   rain man david sacks
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.640]   and instead we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy

[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.600]   messages we sent you when we found out this week yes
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.320]   jason what did you say jason you said uh i was just like wow think about who we could recruit
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   for the fourth spot we need keith raboy we get peter teal in here i said that i really really
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.080]   hope you didn't die but if you did i would love to have your plane as a support plane for my plane
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.480]   and i was thinking you know what i might be pro san francisco if you die i could i might want
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.440]   all right well sorry guys i'm gonna live sorry jason i'm gonna live here's basically what happened
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:46.080]   okay is um so tuesday of last week i had dinner with a few friends and then my friend just we're
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.720]   out outdoors in a restaurant yeah i'll tell you exactly where we were at matzahisa in l.a which
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.440]   had the outdoor parking lot yeah yes the outdoor parking lot area which is a covered outdoor area
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.880]   so you know these like covered areas are effectively inside because it traps the air in
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.200]   there but in any event we had dinner there um the next day he woke up with a fever and sore throat
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.160]   he went and got a covet test he tested positive he is also double vaxxed with pfizer okay so and
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.400]   and i reported this to you guys last week on last week's show so i went out right away on wednesday
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.640]   got
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.440]   a covet test was negative i repeated the test on friday was negative and then sunday rolls around
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.880]   and i wake up and i got a fever i don't really have a sore throat but i've got kind of a i'd say
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.200]   an occasional dry cough and i've got and i've got some sinus congestion david mild fever or like like
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:48.240]   99.9 or like 102.1 it topped off at about 99.9 and it's barely a fever yeah yeah a fever barely
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.560]   fever but i mean it was definitely there and i took tyler
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.360]   and all and it brought it down to the low 99s and uh so any event first thing monday morning i went
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.000]   and got the covet test and sure enough i had covet uh they can't confirm that it's delta variant but
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.040]   they think it is because that's what's like exploding in la right now and so yeah i mean look
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.160]   i mean the good news is it's very mild i mean i'm it's now thursday and i feel like i'm like
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.400]   99 recovered i don't have a fever anymore my feet are you 10 days in now this no no no no
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.240]   no no this is the you know i i came down with symptoms on this past sunday and it's now thursday
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.200]   so i am and wendy were you exposed tuesday night so i was exposed yes you're right it's about 10
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.480]   days but you're convinced that was the only way you could have gotten it right yeah because somebody
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.200]   else at the dinner got has symptoms now too ah so it's a super spreader at matsuhisa yeah yeah
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:50.160]   basically but it shows you how virulent this new delta variant is i mean you've got there are
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.960]   four people out that night plus the person who who had it and two out of the four
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.600]   basically got it and we were all vaccinated including the person who had it and of course
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.640]   he didn't know he had it he didn't have any symptoms till the next day so um and you know
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.880]   i got it i got it five days after exposure it's that five days is like clockwork you know did you
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.120]   um did you have like a pulse ox did you measure any of these other things did any stuff change at
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.080]   all yeah
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.360]   yeah i mean i've i've have the pulse ox meter and it's been around 95
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.760]   so it is down yeah you should be like 98 right yeah it is down slightly it is down slightly and
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.000]   if you go to 92 or 93 they say go to the emergency room i think and and did you self-isolate from
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.520]   your family yeah i did but we were lulled a little bit into a place of overconfidence yeah well i
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.800]   remember i got i got coveted tests on wednesday and then friday and they're both negative i
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.720]   thought we were through it so i was at home
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:57.200]   and um and then and then so my 11 year old got it even though i was isolating this thing is i mean
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.040]   this thing is so contagious so you know what i've read is that delta variant is 60 more transmissible
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.840]   than the uk variant which was the alpha variant the alpha variant was 60 more transmissible than
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.240]   original covet so you're looking at a transmissibility you multiply those together of
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.000]   two and a half times the original and the original covet had an r naught of two to three so you
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.520]   multiply two to three by two and a half times and you're looking at five to eight and you know at
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.960]   the explain to the audience what that means in terms of reality it means the r naught is uh how
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.200]   many people does the average infected person transmit before they know they have it and can
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.960]   fully self-isolate and so you're going from the original covet was two to three delta variant
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.400]   might be like eight we're getting up into like smallpox territory with this thing and it's all
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.800]   because vaccinated people can get it. The Israel data that we talked about on the show last week
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:03.720]   was 64% effectiveness. Israel reported that the effectiveness of Pfizer had gone from 95% to 64%
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.140]   in terms of preventing infection. So you have maybe a third of vaccinated people can get it,
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.680]   and then they can spread it without even knowing they have it. So I think we're at the point now
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.360]   where if you're not vaccinated, you're going to get the Delta variant. We're seeing now cases
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:27.760]   explode all over the country. Even in LA County, they've now had a, the five-day average of cases
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:34.000]   has jumped 500% in one month. So pretty much, and Jason, you've tweeted this, if you are not
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.880]   vaccinated, you are choosing to get the Delta variant at this point. I mean, this thing is
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.000]   extremely transmissible. That's what, there was a great tweet by Scott Adams, the guy who,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.320]   the cartoonist who,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.060]   I wouldn't,
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.360]   who listens to the pod, by the way,
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.440]   who does listen to the pod. He had a, he had a really great quote. He's like,
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:08:02.800]   today is either Wednesday for those that are vaccinated or yet another day where the unvaccinated
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.680]   amongst you are likely to get COVID. Something like that, right? Was that the tweet?
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.160]   Yeah, yeah. It was basically today's Wednesday for people who are vaccinated,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.440]   or it is the day you're going to get, you know, the virus.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.880]   Yeah. I'm trying to stop messing around with this thing. Now, here's some good news, actually, is,
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.820]   is so on the Wednesday when we found out that my friend had tested positive, but again,
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.400]   I was still negative. I had no symptoms. I had nothing. I told my wife, she had gotten one shot.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.880]   She hadn't gotten the second shot. And we were on the fence about whether my 13-year-old should
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.840]   get the vaccine. They both raced out that day, got vaccinated. Of course.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.320]   And he did not get the virus. So they had basically, call it three or four days of the vaccine
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.220]   to trigger an immune response in their system and that protected them. They did not get sick.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.960]   And David, did you take anything else like prednisone? You took nothing, no steroid,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.260]   nothing.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.780]   Nothing. The only stuff I, so my friend did take, he did get prescribed prednisone. My doctor thought
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:04.480]   that was unnecessary or a bad idea for me. All I took, okay, was Tylenol to control the fever,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.500]   and I took Flonase to reduce the sinus congestion. Look, I mean,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.200]   I don't want to overstate this. It was a very mild cold for me. And that is why I think
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.620]   everybody should run out and get vaccinated. What did you pair it with? Like a Pappy Van
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.100]   Winkle or did you go with the Screaming Eagle? What did you pair your cup with?
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.320]   Also, the worst part is Matsuhisa has such a shit wine list. You probably drank this
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.140]   like random swill. That's probably why. You were drinking some like
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:34.060]   nigiri sake in all likelihood. Freeburg, last week, I was asking you,
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.140]   or maybe it was two weeks ago, I was considering getting the Moderna because I was like,
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:44.080]   I think getting two of these things will boost you into the high 90s. You said I was crazy. Has
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.700]   your position changed on that? Yes.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.260]   Okay, explain. Because this is the one time I'm ever going to be right about science,
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:57.700]   a week before you. So, I think the data up to that point didn't necessarily kind of validate
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.760]   that additional level of action, but now it does. And I think new data is coming out. So, I saw
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:12.580]   an executive from a pharmaceutical company a few days ago who broke down some statistics that they
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.960]   looked at in Israel. Yeah. And they were like, "Oh, this is a good thing. This is a good thing.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.500]   This is a good thing." And they were like, "Oh, this is a good thing." And they were like, "Oh, this is a good thing."
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:14.800]   And they were like, "Oh, this is a good thing." And they were like, "Oh, this is a good thing."
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.260]   And what they were identifying was that of the newly infected cases in Israel,
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:27.220]   of people that are vaccinated, nearly two-thirds of those people were vaccinated in January.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.340]   About 30% were vaccinated in February and less than 10% were vaccinated in March. And I'm just
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:40.960]   approximating and I'm just kind of transcribing from kind of what I remember him saying. And so,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.840]   he said, "The more recent vaccinations, we're not seeing any of that." And I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to go ahead and do this."
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.860]   "We're not seeing breakthrough cases, breakthrough infections." So, the more recently you're
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:55.180]   vaccinated, the less likely you are to have this. And then I met with a pretty well-known
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:02.500]   virologist a few days ago as well, who highlighted for me that we are seeing antibody titers decline
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.320]   over time in people. But there's other studies that are showing, which means that the antibodies
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.100]   against COVID in your blood after you get the vaccine slowly go down over time. So, we're seeing
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.720]   that. We knew that, right? We knew that.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.180]   We knew that to some extent. But there was another study that showed that memory B cells, B cells are
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.920]   the immune cells that make antibodies, and they remember the antibodies to make. And they were
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.180]   worried, are we losing those B cells in the human body? And another study found, actually, they're
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.180]   in your lymph nodes. So, they went in, they pulled them out, and they identified, "Look,
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:36.340]   these B cells are persistent. We are having a persistent immune memory to COVID when we
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:43.600]   get exposed to the vaccine or the virus." And so, you know, those two data points, both
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.260]   of them kind of said, "I think we're going to need to do a booster very soon for everyone,
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.700]   and we're going to need to get a third shot."
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.300]   The tail, Friedberg, seems like it's like six months.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.440]   Yeah, it sounds like he was saying that you're going to see an efficacy drop to that kind of
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.780]   two-thirds level after about six months of your - after getting your vaccine. And, you know,
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.520]   he said, "Look, this Delta variant is virulent, but, you know, the more pressing kind of point
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:13.480]   isn't that it's this variant that's breaking through. It's that the efficiency of these vaccines, at
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.360]   this point, looks like it's such that we're going to need to do boosters."
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.280]   Now, Pfizer went to the White House this week with some of this data, and they presented it
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.320]   to the White House. And the White House said, "If you guys follow the news, I'm hearing this,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.780]   I'm repeating what I read in news reports at this point." But what they said was,
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:37.900]   you know, "We're not ready to kind of commit to doing booster shots for a couple of reasons. One
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:43.360]   is there are a lot of people out there that haven't had their first shots. And we're seeing
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.060]   the people that are having these breakthrough infections almost universally, not always,
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.860]   but very large majority having very mild symptoms and not getting hospitalized,
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.420]   and the death rate is still very, very low." In other words, the vaccine did its job.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.040]   The vaccine didn't prevent, you know, an infection, meaning that the virus starts
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.960]   replicating in a way that's uncontrolled in your body, but that your immune system had enough of
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:13.240]   a defense to keep it from causing severe disease in your body. 99% of the people going to the hospital
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:20.260]   are unvaccinated, right? Exactly. And so, we're seeing that great success still with the vaccine,
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.940]   but they are seeing and there are now studies that, you know, I think reference to your earlier
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:31.120]   point that, you know, if you put a different RNA strain, RNA sequence into your body, which Moderna
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.260]   and Pfizer have slightly different, you know, sequences, you end up creating different antibodies
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.240]   and having more diversity of antibodies can kind of provide greater immunity.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.120]   So, it's almost certain we're going to get boosters,
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.780]   and that we're going to end up seeing them hit the market next month in September. Yeah.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:52.300]   Is the booster different than the original? So, for example, if I get a Pfizer booster,
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:59.320]   am I only basically getting still an expression of that RNA strand that I'm supposed to basically,
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   like is it the same formulation, the same dosage?
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.620]   So, both of those options are still up in the air. And so, we may still get the same vaccines that we
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.280]   were getting before. You could go get a Moderna shot, you could go get another Pfizer shot of the
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.000]   exact same,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.920]   RNA sequence that you got before, or they may introduce some new ones. And so,
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.260]   all the pharma companies are proposing both approaches, and they're pursuing both paths
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.460]   right now. And we'll see where we end up. And what about swapping between an RNA approach
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.860]   and a traditional vaccine approach? So, getting J&J plus Moderna or Pfizer versus like, there's
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.820]   a lot of AB testing we need to do to figure out what is the most efficacious and useful pathway.
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:42.280]   This is exactly like the, this reminds me exactly of HIV, where it took 10 years for them to figure
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:42.880]   out what cocktail.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:49.660]   And now look, HIV is I mean, it's, it's, it's kind of like nothing, it's really not that not
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.580]   that bad. And the way that we probably for those of us in our 40s have it emblazoned in our mind is
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.040]   how bad it is versus how bad it is. It was a death sentence.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.540]   It seemed like a death sentence. And today, it's kind of more, it's more manageable than frankly,
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.200]   it's a chronic disease now. That's like having diabetes or something.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:12.760]   I have another crazy statement here, which is that if you take the the case fatality rate of COVID,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.760]   and now you think about the fact that there's going to be call it 60% of America that's
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.640]   vaccinated, and then every six months, we'll be getting boosters. And then you have the Petri dish
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.160]   on the other side of the 40%, where you'll just be ripping through variant after variant after
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:36.940]   variant, eventually, it stands to reason that if 40% of Americans remain unvaccinated two or
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:42.640]   three years from now, the odds that there will be a strain, that is the
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.880]   killer strain that does meaningful damage to those people, I think is basically 100%.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.340]   And if you think about a case fatality rate, that's meaningfully high, what you're effectively
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:16:00.100]   going to do is start to call these people from the earth. And that is a crazy idea. But that's
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.040]   what folks who choose to not get vaccinated are setting themselves up for.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.460]   I mean, it's the quintessential, you know, Darwin.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.580]   Is that just not probabilities? Like, am I getting something wrong here? Probabilistically,
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.000]   isn't that?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.520]   That's what I'm concerned about. And it's not just
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.600]   Americans not getting vaccinated. It's the rest of the world. I mean, even if we got to
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.700]   extraordinarily, extraordinarily high vaccination rates in the US, there's gonna be large, you know,
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.720]   numbers of people outside the US who never get vaccinated, who will continue to be a Petri dish.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:32.620]   To give you to, you know, comparison, the common cold has 1800 variants. That's why we can't get
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.060]   vaccinated. So, you know, we're on the Delta variant right now, I think they actually have
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.920]   numbered variants up to lambda, we're going to run out of letters the alphabet really soon. You know,
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.960]   how long will it be until there are these killer variants that act? I mean, look, I mean,
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:55.120]   that can punch through the vaccines. It's pretty scary, actually. And I would say that this is like
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.560]   quite a come down off where we were just two weeks ago, you know, where we thought the Pfizer vaccine
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:06.220]   was still 95% effective. Now it's 64% effective. I mean, look, I do want to like underscore that
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:11.560]   the vaccine worked in the sense that what I got was super mild. I mean, it was really just like getting,
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.360]   like, a cold. I mean, I didn't need to take anything more serious than Tylenol. But,
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:24.100]   but it does show that the virus is mutating really fast. It's highly transmissible. And I'm not sure
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.620]   we're totally done with this thing. You still have it, right?
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.460]   I still have it. Yeah.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.120]   Yeah. So when will you get tested to figure out when you don't have it anymore?
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.280]   I'll probably go in tomorrow. You know, because it feels to me like I'm about 98% better.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.260]   Freebrook, is there any data
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.140]   about the pattern of people?
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.680]   People who are vaccinated getting this thing? Like, is there - remember how like,
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.600]   you know, there was early data that showed, you know, women had a different immune response than
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.400]   men and like people who were, what was it, O positive or, you know, a certain blood type
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.440]   effectively had inborn immunity?
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:02.140]   I haven't heard or read anything like that. And so, this is still an emerging issue, I think,
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.880]   you know, what we're seeing.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.680]   By the way, I was vaccinated a few months ago, guys. Like, I mean, I am like recently vaccinated.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.720]   When was your second shot?
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.840]   Basically, like a few months ago.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.040]   Yeah, it's -
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.600]   Mine was in March. Yeah.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.560]   One thing I think it's worth highlighting just to reinforce the vaccine importance,
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.120]   you know, the virologist, the infectious disease guy I met with was telling me that,
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:31.420]   you know, one way to think about this is the more opportunity the virus has to replicate,
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.760]   the more opportunity it has to evolve.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:40.420]   And so, when you're vaccinated and you have a mild case and your body recovers in a few days,
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.940]   just to give you guys a sense, the difference when someone that's not vaccinated has COVID and
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:50.380]   they've measured the viral load in the nose from day one when they start having their infectious
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:56.080]   kind of presentation to day four, which is when they peak, the viral load is 10 to the eighth
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   higher. Okay, that's like 100 million times higher. And so, that's 100 million times more
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.860]   viruses that are being produced on day four than were being produced on day one when you were
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.860]   already showing symptoms. So, every time a virus is being produced and is replicating within your body, you're going to have a lot of symptoms.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:06.860]   So, every time a virus is being produced and is replicating within your body, you're going to have a lot of symptoms.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:06.860]   So, every time a virus is being produced and is replicating within your body, you're going to have a lot of symptoms.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.380]   So, every time a virus is being produced and is replicating within your body,
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.980]   it's getting a chance to mutate. The important point he emphasized was what matters most is we
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.540]   get the most number of people on planet Earth vaccinated as fast as possible. Because the
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.260]   faster you can get more people vaccinated, the fewer opportunities you give the virus to replicate
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.660]   and find itself a mutational path that can ultimately break through all these vaccines and
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:36.220]   cause real severe loss of life. And so, the presentation that Sachs kind of described
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:41.180]   it is encouraging in the sense that it likely means that the virus did not create that there
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.020]   wasn't that much of a viral load or a huge viral load relative to what there would have been if he
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:51.420]   wasn't vaccinated. And so, even though he did have an infection, you know, the virus didn't get as
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.540]   much of a chance to spread to other people. It didn't get as much of a chance to mutate.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.260]   But it did because my friend who I got it from after one having dinner one night,
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:05.100]   he was double vaxxed with Pfizer. And in my, you know, my 11 year old daughter got it.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:05.580]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.980]   It's for her again, it's just like a cold.
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.740]   But so, this thing is highly transmissible.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.340]   And what is it?
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.180]   It changes the equation, I think, on some policy questions. So,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.540]   Yeah. That's what I was gonna ask you. What does it mean for the fall? What now? What?
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:27.100]   So, two weeks ago, I thought that because I was vaccinated, I didn't need to care
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.980]   whether other people were vaccinated because, you know, up until that point, the data was you were
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.100]   95% plus, you know, effectiveness. So, why care?
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.420]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:42.220]   If other people get vaccinated. Now, we can say for sure that unvaccinated people can,
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.580]   or vaccinated people even can get, other people can get you sick, even if you are vaccinated. So,
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:54.060]   I think it absolutely changes the equation on, so, for example, colleges were requiring students to
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.460]   get vaccinated to return in the fall. Like before, I didn't think that necessarily made a lot of
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.940]   sense because if you wanted to protect yourself, you just get vaccinated. But now, it makes sense,
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.980]   right? Because the college needs to get to the top of the list.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:04.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:04.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:04.860]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:11.340]   herd immunity to protect everybody against you know potentially right delta variant right so
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.460]   i do think it changes the equation quite a bit and i think we need to make a big push here to
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:25.420]   get everyone vaccinated then in fact sacks for uh vax passports which as um you know uh libertarian
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.140]   i think uh is i think part of your political i think everybody on this call has kind of got a
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.740]   little libertarian like you got to make your own choices here but does it change your thinking
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:42.860]   about that i.e employers uh colleges uh city state workers teachers are either get vaxxed or don't
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:48.780]   come back to the office and you're fired well i'll tell you i don't like the idea of government
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:54.300]   having the power to to stick a needle in your arm but i do think that
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.220]   employers workplaces schools i think it's very reasonable
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.380]   for them to say if you want to come back to the workplace you have to get vaccinated
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.180]   because your unvaccinated status creates a risk it creates an externality for everybody
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.860]   should they be able to fire you if you're a teacher should they be able to fire you if you're
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:18.860]   a bus driver if you're a pilot yes okay so here's the craziness this is a a self-inflicted wound we
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:25.820]   are down to only 700 000 vaccines being given a day we peaked we had the ability to do five million
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:31.020]   shots a day at the peak back in april we hit over five million shots in one day in the united states
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.300]   states and that's a country where you know whatever 270 million adults you know were able
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.540]   to get it in other words two percent of the pop adult population in a single day could have gotten
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.780]   it now we're down to 700 we have over a billion vaccines sitting on shelves eighty percent of
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:51.420]   democrats have received one shot compared to 49 of republicans 27 of republicans say
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.980]   that they won't get vaccinated under any circumstances compared to three percent of
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.460]   democrats answering that question the same way and an additional nine percent will only do so if
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.700]   required again three percent of democrats said they would only do so required so that's 36
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:11.100]   are opting out forever i get it but it's because we allowed it to become a position
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.380]   meaning it's not it's not like anybody has a position on breathing breathing is not a political
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.740]   position right it's not like i choose to not breathe or drinking water or trying to you know
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:28.780]   like these like eating three meals a day if you can we have allowed the most basic of issues in
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.900]   this case you know collaboration and the lack of collaboration and the lack of collaboration and
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:34.140]   you know collective public health to be politicized in a way and that is entirely the government's
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:39.340]   fault it's the government's fault and it's the media and the media because the media has
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.620]   exacerbated it so that they can have power people on the conservative side of the spectrum have
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:49.340]   learned to distrust the media and big corporations because and government because they've been lied
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.380]   to so often most recently yeah right most recently with like the lab leak theory
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.620]   and so you know there's this suspicion on the right like what aren't they telling us
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.780]   you know um now look i think we got to get over this i think you know we need to get everyone
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:08.460]   vaccinated for all the reasons that freiburg said or look everyone's going to get delta variant i
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.220]   mean maybe this is a good news is that we can rapidly get to herd immunity by everyone getting
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.820]   delta variant well that's the inevitable outcome for any infectious disease right
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.900]   highly infectious diseases either you can vaccinate or everyone's going to get it
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.820]   uh and it's gonna you know i mean you've got a delta variant maybe then whatever the
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.740]   you know whatever the more dangerous deadly one is yeah let me just highlight what i'm most concerned
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:32.300]   about i i am most concerned about what's what's happening with sax just anecdotally speaking i'm
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.700]   not going to speak to the i'll speak to one statistic but like anecdotally speaking i'm hearing
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.260]   this happening more more frequently i don't know about you guys other friends other people you know
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:47.340]   but a lot of other people i'm hearing about their double backs that are now getting covid so as that
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:53.260]   starts to happen uh the implications for the economy i think are pretty significant um
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:59.580]   because i think people whether there's a policy change or not people are going to get scared again
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:04.380]   and people if we're not kind of enforcing economic lockdown people will go into social lockdown
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.420]   and we're going to revisit uh you know more of the behavior we saw over the past year
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.580]   where people are going to be nervous to travel people are going to be nervous to fly people
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.500]   are going to be nervous to go to restaurants and you know the downstream consequences of
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.700]   everyone kind of locking up again even if the government doesn't enforce lockups uh could be
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.940]   pretty catastrophic are you feeling that way yourself freeburg in other words am i going to
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:32.220]   lock myself up are you going to go to dinner are you going to go to travel to italy or to
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.460]   you know japan or you know would you go to disneyland with your kids how is it affecting
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:42.460]   you your personal behavior being a man of science uh so my personal circumstances are
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.420]   a little different right now uh not not to get into it um uh just with my uh
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:52.140]   you know my wife's pregnant and we're moving houses and so we've got a bunch of reasons why we're not
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:59.580]   traveling and and exposing ourselves unnecessarily right now um but uh i i would say that at this
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.860]   point uh you know if all other things being equal would i go to disneyland with my kids i would
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:11.740]   probably wait right now six to twelve weeks to see what happens here right well i think like if i'm
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.420]   feeling that way now i think a lot of people are going to be feeling that way in in the next four
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.780]   weeks as they hear about more friends getting covid now the good news is the hospital so i am
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:27.100]   in a very very very very delicate economic recovery right now and you know we have put out
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:32.940]   so much money to stimulate this economy everyone is so walking on like the razor's edge to keep
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.020]   things you know growing we were afraid of inflation lumber prices today by the way
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.380]   are lower than they were when this whole kind of inflationary thing started and everyone was
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.860]   freaking out about it so um you know lumber prices are lower than they were at the start of the year
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.500]   which is you know like a lot of this kind of inflation risk has kind
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.020]   of come out of the equation already so the markets have taken that pricing out
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.780]   and now we're going to be in a circumstance where people might cancel their travel people might
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.100]   cancel their their restaurants people might stop going to the office again stop you know getting in
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:05.660]   the car etc etc so i am most concerned about like the psychological effects of of what we're seeing
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:10.460]   with these breakthrough infections the frequency of them now if you look at the israel data so
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:16.860]   israel had zero deaths for two weeks they're now averaging about one death a day um and despite this
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.460]   you know huge increment they're getting about i think 500 breakthrough infections a day right now
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.220]   so that is good statistical news right statistically these breakthrough infections are
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.820]   not fatal they're not causing hospitalizations they're they're you know if you kind of did the
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.820]   math going back a year and said these are the actual statistics of covid people would be like
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.860]   okay no big deal let's move on it's a it's a tough kind of uh virus but because of the
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:44.300]   circumstances where we we are kind of under these these feelings that this is a fatal
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:49.900]   disease and could cause fatalities those statistics don't matter the fear is what matters and people
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.940]   are going to start to behave quite differently i think in the next few weeks i have a slightly
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:58.300]   different point of view here but um i think freeburg you're you're i think you're right in
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:04.300]   some respects um but i don't think it's going to come from people i don't think people uh i think
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.260]   people are exhausted and they want to go back to life as normal yeah and i think this summer
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:15.500]   was a window into some amount of normalcy for a lot of us and i don't think we really do want to
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.340]   go back um and so i think what's what's really going to happen is that we're going to have to
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:25.460]   going to happen is there's going to be essentially some form of class warfare. And instead of rich
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:31.220]   versus poor and left versus right, it's sort of between people who believe in science and then the
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:37.660]   ideologically dogmatic who refuse to get it. And that's going to play itself out economically,
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.000]   I agree with you. There's going to be meaningful forms of economic discrimination against people
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.900]   who are unnecessarily compounding risk for the rest of us, who want to deal with it,
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:54.620]   ideally, touch wood as a common cold, like David said, and move the fuck on. And if we are
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:00.060]   prevented from doing so, because economic policy and healthcare policy has to constantly get
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:05.640]   rerated for a cohort of people who could protect themselves and everybody else but chooses not to,
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:12.020]   there is going to be a real pushback on that. The second thing that I think is going to happen is
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:16.200]   politicians proved that if you give them a window to seize power,
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.780]   they will do it. And I think what's really going to happen in the fall is if there's even a small
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:28.540]   modicum of risk, which there will be as we just talked about, yeah, it exists now. Yeah, I think
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.300]   it's the politicians that are going to want to jump all over this and say, Okay, guys, you know,
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.760]   lockdowns here, you can't do this, you can't do that. Literally, Gavin Newsom just did the big
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.380]   grand reopening California's back, you could see him locking it back up in September.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.220]   Oh, that's the best way to it's the best way to snuff out any chance of the recall going against
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.440]   them is that even if you were angry, you're going to be able to do it. And I think that's going to
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:54.220]   be a massive form of voter suppression. Well, I think that would backfire pretty bad.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.960]   You saw the flip flopping that he already did actually on schools where
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.500]   the government of California basically said, Hey, you know, we're going to mandate a mask policy in
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.060]   the fall. And then Newsom came out because people freaked out and said, actually, no,
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:13.000]   each local municipality can figure it out based on you know, what it what it means for them.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.780]   The point is, guys,
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:21.540]   freebrook is right. These things aren't going away. We have a cohort of people who will continue
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:27.480]   to allow this thing to become worse than it has to be. And I think that there will be economic
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:33.960]   repercussions and discrimination against those people for that. And I think economically, we are
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.520]   going to take a step back because politicians will try to slow the economy down again.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:45.120]   And there is definitely from the right, not to get political here, but they've been pretty silent about
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:50.940]   encouraging people to get vaccinated. And, you know, at CPAC and other places, people were
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:56.580]   cheering the anti vax movement, Mitt Romney came out. We don't control conservative media figures,
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.620]   so far as I know, at least I don't. That being said, I think it's an enormous error for anyone
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:06.260]   to suggest that we shouldn't be taking vaccines. Look, the politics is politicization of vaccination
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.960]   is an outrage and frankly, moronic. Mitch McConnell came out and says a polio victim
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.100]   myself when I was young. I've studied that disease. It took 70 years 70 years to come up with two
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:21.020]   vaccines that finally ended the polio threat. As a result of Operation Warp Speed, we have not one,
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.700]   not two, but three highly effective vaccines. So I'm perplexed by the difficulty we're having
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.220]   finishing the job. This is where you can expect the politically correct companies
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:36.940]   to act first because they're the woke mob will force some action on this issue. Whether you like
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.420]   it or not, but this is this is where the next petition will come from Apple, where the two or
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.080]   3000 employees who are vaccinated, etc, who have people with
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:50.940]   you know, people in their households with with who are immunologically suppressed. And they're
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.500]   going to say, Hey, guys, this is crazy. Well, that that petition might be the first
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.540]   Apple petition that would make sense because those employees are directly impacted by other
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.420]   employees who come to the workplace on vaccinated unlike, you know, the issues around Israel or
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.140]   Antonio's book, whatever that they shouldn't have taken a position on.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.620]   Wait a second, you're saying Antonio's book wouldn't make them feel safe and getting COVID
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:15.060]   would make them unsafe? Yeah, actually, actually, yes. Yes.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:20.160]   COVID COVID is COVID in the workplace is a real safety issue. Not you know, not whether somebody
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:25.200]   wrote a book five years ago. So So I think they do. I think employees do have a right to say to
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.360]   their employers, listen, are we going to be a vaccinated workplace or not? Because it does
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.040]   impact their risk. But But Jason, it's your question about should people change their
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:39.360]   behavior? In light of this news, okay, in light of the fact that we now are learning
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.680]   about some reduced effectiveness of the vaccines. Here's what I would tell people sitting where I am,
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:51.100]   this is not a big deal. I mean, for me, okay, it was not a big deal. It was like a mild cold, I am not
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:56.920]   going to change my I'm going to go back to normal, like my pre COVID behavior. And I would tell you,
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.660]   like, if you're double vax, I don't think you need to be that afraid of this. Because, you know,
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.380]   my doctor said they are seeing a bunch of these breakthrough cases, but they're all very mild. It
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.760]   really is like getting a cold. I'm not changing my behaviors. I made my I made my decision. My risk
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.660]   assessment is if I get it, then I'm doubly protected. And I'm not going to change my behavior.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.720]   I'm not going to wind up in the hospital, I'm going to focus all my energy on riding my bike
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.200]   and taking my kids out and having a good time. I'm not going back in lockdown.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.980]   So I think that's right for you. But But here's where it gets a little bit complicated is my
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:29.300]   parents who are in their 70s. And one of them has an immune condition asked what they should do. And
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.400]   I said, Listen, if I were you guys, I would not be going to public places, I'd be masking up.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.260]   They're asking me if they should go on a trip. And I said, No, I would actually if I were you,
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:44.640]   I would lock down until this blows over because they're at elevated risk. And so yeah, for me,
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.260]   getting COVID was like a mild case, but for them, maybe it could be more serious. So
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:53.340]   all it takes is 10% of the population acting like what you just described,
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.080]   you recommended to your parents sex for there to be economic ripples associated with this,
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:03.120]   this this breakthrough kind of condition for a while. And that's where I have the most concern
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.960]   is again, like, you know, we're kind of you're not concerned about the deaths free bird,
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.460]   you're concerned about the economic impact and the psychological scars that are now in place.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.620]   I will explain I sent you guys a link to the Reuters
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.280]   article where they covered the press conference with the Prime Minister of Israel the other day.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.000]   And basically, they are taking what they're calling a soft suppression strategy,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.600]   where they're encouraging Israelis to learn to live with the virus, involving the fewest
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.680]   possible restrictions and avoiding a fourth national lockdown that could do further harm
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:38.200]   to the economy. And he said implementing the strategy will entail taking certain risks,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:43.960]   but in the overall consideration, including economic factors, this is the necessary balance.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.340]   And so it's a it's a it's a very kind of pointed position that they're coming to,
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.540]   I think the US government, the federal government is going to have to come to the same one. But we
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.840]   have different states and different local governments that are going to act differently.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:02.060]   And because we've you know, we have authority vested in those different jurisdictions,
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:07.280]   you could see different public policy officials take different positions. And what we're talking
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.980]   about, if San Francisco said, restaurants have to go back to 25% capacity, it would decimate these
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.580]   already struggling small businesses. And then they would have to go back to 25% capacity. And then
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.320]   there's no more stimulus dollars available. And so you kind of think about this, or 10% of people
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:25.200]   cancel their vacation plans. What's that going to do to airlines and hotels? So again, my concern is,
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:31.020]   are we about to hit a wave of economic ripples that aren't necessarily tied to what is the right
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.100]   thing to do from a policy perspective, or a science or health perspective, but really,
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:40.140]   the psychological effects of the scared and concerned saying, you know what, there's more
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.560]   money available, like, you know, we got bailed out before we'll get bailed out again, let's implement
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.540]   a shutdown, let's implement a lockdown, let's not go to work and set whatever the decision tree you
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.140]   may have as a business owner or a policymaker. Well, there's an important point here,
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.860]   which is listen, COVID is going to be with us for a long time, we're going to need to make really
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:02.980]   smart cost benefit analysis decisions in how to deal with it. We can't go back to lockdowns,
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.960]   because they didn't work. And they're extremely expensive. We spent $10 trillion battling COVID
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:13.300]   last year, we cannot do that again, we don't have the bullets in our gun to keep firing at this
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.540]   thing like that. We got to start doing it again. And we're going to have to do it again. And we're
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.040]   going to have to do it again. And we're going to have to do it again. And we're going to have to
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.540]   make smart cost benefit decisions. And we're going to have to make smart cost benefit decisions.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:22.480]   Zeroism is not going to work this idea that the premise of zeroism is that we can stamp out every
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:28.720]   last vestige of COVID. But maybe that was even a possibility when vaccines were 99% effective. But
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.200]   now that they're not, there's no chance of stamping out COVID. So we have got to learn,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.520]   we've got to like like the Israel example, we've got to learn to live with this thing, and make
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.520]   smart cost benefit decisions. But I also think, you know, this is kind of a disaster for humanity. We
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:49.520]   now have this new category of illness that's rapidly mutating, we don't know what the end of
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.900]   it's going to be. Like I said, there's 1800 variants of the common cold.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:53.700]   You know what though, David?
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:58.260]   That's causing these symptoms. By the way, has anyone noticed how many different symptoms this
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.800]   virus causes in people? There's over 200 long long COVID symptoms.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.020]   Well, they worked on it for a long time, David, in fairness.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:09.000]   Yes, exactly. Everyone knows it's a lab engineered virus that's now a plague on
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.500]   humanity. This is really a disaster. This is going to, I think, permanently impact human
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.800]   life expectancy. I mean, this is this is a serious problem.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.060]   We could have avoided this entire thing here in the United States, at least.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:30.160]   If people just took the win, how frustrating is this that we would probably have cases down to
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:36.940]   1000 a day, and deaths down to 10 a day, like Israel, if we had just gotten everybody to take
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:44.480]   one of the billions of excess vaccines sitting on shelves and in CVSs and Walgreens across the
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.160]   country? How stupid are we?
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:51.680]   We don't have the collectivism to make those actions. If you think about what's happening in
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.860]   Israel did two different examples in China, collectivism manifests as like basically a top
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:06.620]   down, you know, form of governance, okay? In Israel, collectivism comes from a need for state
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:12.080]   level security, right? I mean, I've traveled to Israel a lot. I've worked there. And it's crazy
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.460]   when you see how people cooperate together.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:21.720]   The minute you hear the missile alarms, right? And so there is a way for people to do cost benefit
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.520]   analyses in Israel, because it's a matter of life or death. And they've been trained to do that. So
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.560]   either it's imposed on you, like in China, or people bottoms up can understand these tradeoffs,
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:37.920]   like in Israel, we're in a very different place, where literally what we have are three things
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:44.440]   that are in conflict with each other, Jason, we have politics and the desire for power,
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:50.740]   we have the deconstruction of power by social media, and then we have the traditional media
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.780]   trying to stay relevant. That's a toxic thing that's spinning around and spinning around and
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:02.140]   spinning around. Trying to allocate this very ephemeral thing called power and influence,
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:07.300]   and we don't know how it works anymore. And so we cannot get our shit together. Half the people care
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.820]   about vegan fucking milk. The other half the people care. I mean, it's it's we are in a alternate
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.420]   universe,
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.420]   as bad as we are.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:20.300]   Europe, and even Japan have done even worse because, I mean, our government was fairly
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.920]   efficient about the distribution of the vaccines. In Europe, they've just completely botched it.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:30.360]   Same thing in Japan. So, we are not the worst on vaccination rates. Yes, it should be better,
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.400]   but this is a global problem.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.080]   Well, we are the worst on capturing the opportunity, David. We have the opportunity
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:36.540]   to have everybody vaccinated.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.860]   No, listen, let's be honest. America is the most exceptional country in the world.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.940]   It has been for hundreds of years. It should be for several hundred more.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:51.340]   There is no excuse for this country to have fucked this up this badly. I've spent enough time,
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:56.940]   as you guys have in Europe and in Japan, it's understandable why those countries are in the
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.580]   positions they're in. It is not understandable why America is in the position.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:06.120]   So dumb. It's like having a 20-point lead with eight minutes to go, and you just screw up,
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.760]   and you lose the game. So stupid. All right, do we want to move on to the
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:10.980]   billion-dollar question?
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.860]   Yeah, I think that's positive news.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:19.240]   This company, what's it called? Virgin Galactic? There's a company called Virgin Galactic,
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:24.100]   and they take people to space. It's $200,000. Stock seems to be doing pretty well.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.660]   Anybody have thoughts on Richard Branson getting to space? I don't know. Let's just
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:34.800]   randomly go to somebody. Chima? No, in all seriousness, congratulations.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.960]   I cried. Nat and I.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.680]   Start the SEC transcript, public statement. Here we go.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.020]   Nat and I watched it together.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.620]   You cried?
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:50.320]   And it was emotional. It's emotional because you know, I mean, being a little bit more on the
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:57.000]   inside, how hard they worked. I mean, we've all been there where we're all toiling in obscurity,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.960]   where there are moments where everybody thinks that what you're doing either is crazy or isn't
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.900]   going to work or is going to fail. And there's a moment where you just have to push through it,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.000]   right? And find people that believe in you.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.960]   I think I came in very late to that, but I had the opportunity to find these incredible people,
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.700]   believe in them, help them, give them capital, which was essentially oxygen, right? That's oxygen
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:27.640]   for a company. And then to see them achieve it, it felt so special to be a part of it. So yeah,
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:33.800]   I mean, I was really emotional. And it was beautiful. So I don't know. I think this is
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   the beginning of the beginning. I tweeted this out. But basically, if you think about, and there's
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:39.960]   other people out there, but I think this is the beginning of the beginning. I tweeted this out.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.360]   I think this is the beginning of the beginning. I tweeted this out. I think there's other stuff that
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.020]   we can't talk about with some other companies that we are all involved in David and I particularly,
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:51.640]   but here's the point, guys, between sending people and making us an interplanetary species,
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:58.560]   by creating pervasive internet access, and by enabling us to safely and reliably transport
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:05.320]   people either point to point sub orbitally, or basically into space. We are completely
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.540]   reimagining how the human race can work. And I think that's incredible.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   And to be a part of that is really special. There was a lot of people who got very negative.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.080]   On Twitter, I noticed there was a lot of people that said, you know, no, like, you know, maybe now
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.940]   we can deal with, I don't know, child hunger, or, you know, hey, why are all these billionaires doing
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:32.840]   this out of the other end? I took a step back and I thought, my gosh, a people are in there's a small
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:39.020]   virulent cohort of people that are incredibly negative. And B doesn't even know what they're
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.880]   talking about. Because, you know, I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing. I think that's
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.000]   the thing. I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing. Because
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.360]   you're talking about issues of state responsibility and confusing it for what private citizens are
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.880]   doing to advance a set of technologies that I think have broad appeal. So, those are my thoughts. I
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.920]   mean, I was I watched every minute of it. And I thought it was incredible.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.400]   Just to add to that. Yeah, I want to I want to take the part that all the naysayers and
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:04.320]   the negativity I mean, Chamath is right. All the very online people immediately came out
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:09.840]   attacking this extraordinary accomplishment and act of bravery by brands
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.600]   and I mean, this is a billionaire, he doesn't need to be risking his life, launching himself
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:19.840]   into space. I mean, this is a courageous act, you know, he's putting his his, his life where his
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:25.340]   mouth is. And you had all these very online people, but you had one CNN commentator basically
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:31.320]   said this was bad for the environment. You had another one saying that calling him a tax cheat.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:37.020]   Then there was another whiner who said, What about all the starving children in the world? I mean,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.540]   it just went on and on like this. And
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:48.320]   Mike Solana had a pretty funny tweet summing up the sort of the left's argument. Thusly said,
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.360]   number one, this is their argument, according to Solana, one money is evil to therefore people
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:58.280]   with money are evil. Three, therefore things people with money care about evil. I mean,
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.120]   that is basically the level of sophistication. Everybody's talking about that's being made.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.000]   It's that's the argument that the left is making.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.960]   Everybody's a bond villain.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.760]   Right. But here's the problem is that first of all, we do get
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:16.120]   tremendous benefits out of these innovators who are pushing the boundaries of science and
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.980]   technology and engineering. You know, Branson actually went on Stephen Colbert show and
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:25.300]   defended he said, he said, Listen, I think they're not fully this is Branson. He said,
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.220]   I think they're not fully educated to what space does for Earth is connecting the billions of
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:34.600]   people who are not connected. Down here, he said every single spaceship that we've sent,
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.680]   putting satellites up there monitoring different things around the world, like the degradation of
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.720]   rainforest, monitoring,
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.980]   food distribution, even monitoring things like climate change. These things are essential for
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:49.320]   us back on Earth. So we need more spaceships going up to space, not less. So, you know,
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:55.140]   they're really just kind of ignorant about the benefits of technology. And what do they want to
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.860]   do with the money anyway? You know, we've got all the Yes, we do have all these problems on Earth.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:04.440]   But so many of our problems are not a problem of underfunding. We have tons of money going to the
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.980]   problem of homelessness in California just keeps getting worse because we have the wrong approach.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.680]   We have very uneducated.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.020]   We have very wrong ideas. We have the wrong organization. We have the wrong execution.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.740]   Fix the operating details. It's not a money issue.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:24.020]   Exactly. Take education in California. We have very high levels of per pupil spending and our
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:28.040]   test scores keep going down. Why? Because we have unions controlling the schools. There's
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.580]   no competition. Don't worry, David, we're getting rid of testing. We've eliminated
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.520]   testing. We solved that problem. We spent more as a percentage of
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:39.640]   GDP on health care than any other Western country in the world. Yet the life expectancy of white men
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:44.740]   which is basically the top of the pyramid of health care is now sub 80 years old. What is going
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:52.120]   on? If all of these negative naysayers could actually just get into the arena and try to do
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:56.680]   something. Right. Instead of whining. Instead of whining. Instead of whining.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.520]   Professional whiner class.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:02.240]   They have no ideas. They have no ideas. They have no solutions. They just have gripes.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.580]   And no ability to execute apparently.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:09.600]   Yeah. Why don't they come up with new programs, actually test new programs at a hyperlocal
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.060]   level to see what works. Okay. Can I tell you why? Can I tell you why?
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:24.240]   These sort of like leftist whiners are not motivated to actually do the hard work. Meaning,
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.300]   even if they have an idea for education, the precondition to working on an education program
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.500]   or a health care program is they may need to spend four or five years in the bowels,
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:39.560]   in obscurity, just learning. Paying their dues. They don't want to do that either because
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:43.740]   they grew up in a culture of kindergarten soccer. Everybody gets the gold star. Everybody
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.760]   gets to touch the ball. Everybody gets to be at the front of the line. And they're not
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:53.060]   willing to put in the work because the minute they realize how much actual work is demanded
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:57.380]   of progress, they run away because they're scared. And the reason they're scared is because
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:03.360]   somewhere along the way, somebody tricked them. That it was not actually about trying.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.940]   It was actually about succeeding.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:09.520]   And that is the biggest failure that we could do to people is all of a sudden tricking them to believe.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.960]   You have to have it work. So they'd rather be hall monitors. They'd rather be critics.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.760]   Yeah, they'd rather be critics than try.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   Failure is just as good because you're one step closer to succeeding. Somewhere along the way,
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.440]   unfortunately, they were not taught that incredible secret hiding in plain sight.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.720]   Friedberg, what do you think of the space race and the hall monitor whiner class?
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.600]   If you guys look, I was going to send these statistics earlier,
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:38.800]   but if you look at the amount of venture capital money that's gone into private space
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:44.040]   companies, space technology companies, I think it was a few hundred million dollars,
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.640]   call it three to $400 million pretty consistently from 2011 through 2014, pretty flat.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:55.160]   And then in 2015, I think this is when SpaceX started to kind of create a lot of momentum
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:00.520]   and hype that private companies can't actually build businesses in kind of call it the space
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.600]   industry. The number jumped to 3 billion a year, and then it was a little over three and a half
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.440]   billion in 16. And then it jumped to almost 5 billion in 17. It was a little bit down in 18.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.600]   2020, it's climbed to almost 10 billion. And in Q1 of this year, I think we're at 2 billion
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.160]   of venture capital money going into private space companies. So there's clearly
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:26.760]   a great deal of momentum in this industry. The question is always what's the market at the end?
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.560]   And so if you break out, how do these companies make money?
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:35.800]   One is to provide services to governments, you know, launch services and taking people to the
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.400]   space station, what have you. And SpaceX has obviously built a tremendous business in that.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:45.520]   There has been obviously a lot of interest in tourism. And I think it's, you know,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.320]   we're seeing this first breakthrough with Virgin Galactic. And we're going to find out over the
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:55.840]   next couple of years, is there a tourism market? Historically, there's been interest in a market for
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:02.480]   visual satellites. But you know, if you look at some of the financials of companies like Planet
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:07.680]   Labs, they did a few acquisitions in space imaging, and the revenue hasn't really taken off
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.360]   there. And then mine is a little bit more expensive. And then, you know, the revenue hasn't
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.720]   really taken off. And mining was always this other question is, can we go out and mine,
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:15.960]   you know, rare minerals from space? And that one is just, you know, if you do the math on it,
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:21.320]   it's so far away, it's impossible to kind of model. So I think over the next... And then finally,
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.840]   it's communications. And communications are cheaper to run on Earth if you're in cities
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.000]   versus, you know, the SpaceX model is to reach rural areas that it's going to be
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:35.240]   more affordable to do this through space. And so, you know, there's obviously a ton of
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.840]   momentum and a ton of interest in private companies getting to space.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.800]   So I think everyone right now, it seems is trying to figure out what's the market, right? What's the...
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.320]   How big is the market? How big is the business? And you know, how quickly can you actually see
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.760]   that capital turn around into real revenue? So, you know, there's this kind of market question
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:50:00.000]   that I think is still outstanding. In terms of, you know, the opportunity, if you go back to like
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:08.560]   the 15th century, I think something like 60% to 70% of ships, maritime travel, you know, got into
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.280]   shipwrecks. And you know, that's where, you know, you go back to the '70s, you know, you're like,
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.600]   you know, the, you know, that's around when, you know, we sailed across the Atlantic or the
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.320]   Spanish sailed across the Atlantic or funded... No, or they disappeared.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.640]   Or they disappeared. I mean, they basically crashed. It didn't work.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.920]   It was a one-way trip, sometimes to the bottom of the ocean.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:29.160]   If you were sitting in Spain in 1450, and someone said, "Hey, these ships,
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.960]   it's going to be a great business. We're going to build lots of ships and we're going to go out.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   Maybe we'll get trade routes going. Maybe we'll discover new land. Maybe we'll make money.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.240]   Maybe we'll take people on trips on these ships." You would be like, "This is
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:44.560]   crazy. Half the people are dying. There's no market on the other side." So, you know,
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.280]   we are in that kind of... And you would have been totally wrong.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.520]   Yeah. And you are in that 15th century moment right now with the space industry.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.600]   Great analogy. Now, would anyone in the space,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.920]   would anyone in the ship business in the 15th century have been able to predict
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:03.520]   Carnival cruise lines or been able to predict evergreen ships taking stuff from China to America
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:09.200]   with these huge shipping crates? Would anyone have been able to predict, you know,
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:14.360]   going down to the bottom of the Atlantic? I mean, like all of the technology and the entire
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:20.120]   industry that kind of came out of that, you know, that set of pioneering activity in the 15th
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:27.000]   century transformed the planet, transformed the economy, transformed humanity. And, you know,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.800]   it's very hard to sit here today and say, "Hey, I know where space is going, where the space
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.640]   industry is going. I know what's going to be possible." But I can tell you that if history
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.160]   is any predictor of the future, you know, this pioneer, this pioneer, this pioneer,
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.620]   hearing work that's going on, which is burning tons of money,
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.540]   and everyone's kind of questioning whether there's
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:47.340]   businesses here, it could transform our species. Once
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.000]   again, so yeah,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.860]   David, your 15th century shipping example is so
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:57.160]   beautiful. three things that came out of that, which I think
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:05.280]   we all value. One insurance, to tort law, and carry. Exactly.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.100]   And three was basically how they did risk management. So
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.100]   that, you know, each ship would take a little piece of
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.780]   everybody else's cargo so that some of the cargo would always
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:17.100]   get to marketplaces emerged Lloyds of London. Yeah, Lloyds
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.660]   of London emerged because of the maritime insurance that was
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:23.200]   required and the and almost all PNC insurance can trace its
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.800]   roots back to maritime insurance during that that era. Well, and
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.000]   so these these ancillary industries that emerged were
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.020]   like surprising, right?
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.720]   It's almost business models emerged because you had to
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.160]   figure out how you do the arbitrage and carry is the
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.720]   perfect example. People don't understand the venture capital
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.960]   carry, we get 20% of the
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.280]   profits was designed so that people with ships, the captain
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.740]   would get to say we get 20% of whatever makes it there. Now
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.980]   you're aligned, whatever makes it there, you get 20% of Okay,
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.280]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna go through that storm, and I'm gonna try to
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.200]   get it there. And we don't there's so many unknowns. But
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.880]   just looking at the one thing, you know, Starlink, I was doing
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.640]   a little research today about internet penetration, we've got,
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.000]   you know, close to 5 billion people on the internet now. But
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.840]   a very small number of them are on broadband, it's like 20%, 30%,
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:08.740]   somewhere in that numbers,
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:12.040]   it's hard to get an exact number there. But if you think about
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.620]   what's going to happen to humanity, we're talking about
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.400]   billions of people who did not have access to broadband. And
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:23.680]   they are going to go from not having, you know, if you think
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.840]   about what we went through in the West, when the internet first
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.060]   came out, and we got our first brown bag connections, you know,
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.160]   to find us like DSL, or whatever. We had libraries, we
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:35.140]   had books, we had colleges, we had stores everywhere, Barnes
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.920]   and Noble. So the internet was unbelievably transformative. But
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.860]   we were in a modern society, now you go to the developing world.
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:45.080]   And they're going to go from, you know, not even having
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.460]   running water, in some cases in their homes or electricity, or,
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.620]   you know, variable to having broadband. And they're gonna
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:56.020]   have access to YouTube circa 2022 2023, they're gonna have
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:01.360]   access to, you know, MIT courseware or brilliant.org. And
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.200]   all of this information and shopping, we're going to take a
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.640]   billion or 2 billion people and give them broadband instantly
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.620]   within a decade.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:13.120]   This is going to change the face of the planet. I think that
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.480]   that's the revolution. And it's not just Starlink doing it.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.460]   There's like three competitors to Starlink. Obviously,
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.840]   Starlink's got the biggest lead.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.200]   Yeah, before SpaceX doing this, and there were others, there was
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.220]   a company called Oh, three B, it was stood for other 3 billion.
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:30.160]   And they had raised a ton of money to do this. I just I, by
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.720]   the way, I just want to speak to like a trend that we've seen.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:37.480]   And and also speak to the quality of Elon's leadership.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.880]   And I think that's a really important thing. And I think it's
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.280]   really important to think about that. And I think that's one of
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.240]   the things that we've been talking about, like, is the the
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.380]   world's largest satellite company, the world's largest
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.660]   satellite company, which is a company called skybox. And we've
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.180]   talked about it in a lot of our conversations, but it's a very,
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:56.080]   very different thing. Because, you know, so many companies have
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.900]   tried this, Google talked about it for years, which is how you
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.140]   can project, well, project loon was a follow on to what we
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:05.320]   talked about early on at Google, which was putting up satellites.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.480]   And there were a bunch of startups that emerged that were
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.920]   all about building small scale satellites that could go up into
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.220]   low Earth orbit, and do things like imaging and communications.
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.460]   And a bunch of these companies were banking on the fact that
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:22.000]   the cost per kilogram to get your payload into space was
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.760]   declining pretty precipitously. So they were like, let's make
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.880]   super cheap commodity, you know, space imaging or space
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.000]   communication boxes, put them in space. And after a couple of
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.220]   years, they'll fall out of orbit and burn up. But it doesn't
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:34.960]   matter if we can get enough use out of them. And they cost so
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.260]   little.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.300]   little to put into space, and they cost a little to make, let's
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.920]   put hundreds of them up. So there's a company called Planet
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.700]   Labs, that that does this, that's, I think, going public via
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.040]   spec. Now that again, they've been challenged with building the
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.800]   business and imaging. But there was a Google bought a company
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.080]   for I think half a billion dollars called skybox trying to
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.960]   do this, which was like imaging slash comms. And they had a
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.420]   bigger refrigerator size box that they were trying to put up.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:59.080]   Ultimately, ultimately, Google, Google spun that out to Planet
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.600]   Labs. And the whole thing kind of, you know, became imaging.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.120]   But I just want to highlight that this has been a big trend
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:04.720]   for a while.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.380]   And it speaks to the quality of Elon, his leadership, because
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:11.440]   the fact that this guy did what 20 other 30 other people have
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.220]   tried companies have tried to do for the past decade or so. And
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.180]   he said, you know what, instead of just providing the the
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.600]   infrastructure to get all these devices into space, we're just
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.540]   going to build the actual devices, get this thing up and
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:26.020]   just go crazy with it and put our capital into it. And it's
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.120]   really impressive to see because it's such a no brainer. And
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.340]   people have been talking about this, this opportunity for over
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.580]   a decade. And these guys just have absolutely rushed the
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:34.120]   field.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.360]   And they could build an incredible business out of this
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:37.960]   you know,
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.360]   the two most important companies in satellite communications are
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.020]   Starlink and swarm. And swarm was a company that I seated and
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.820]   sacks to the Series A and the if you talk to the founders of that
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:52.000]   company, you know, they'll give you this use case in I think it
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.840]   was in 2014. Do you guys remember there was a like a
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.880]   Malaysian Airlines flight that just disappeared? Yeah,
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:02.680]   disappeared. 370. Yeah, Malaysian Airlines flight 370.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.180]   And it was like 230.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:10.000]   And it was like, 240 people that passed away. And the the most,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.440]   you know, indelible question that I remember from this was,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.440]   we, we couldn't track it. And I thought to myself, how is that
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.140]   even possible? How do you how do you lose? How do you lose a
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:23.180]   flight in the middle of the earth? It's not possible. It
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.180]   turns out it is because our internet coverage is so sad,
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:31.520]   that it only covers small areas. And it made obvious that like,
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.820]   you know, we should live in a world where there is a lot of
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.240]   people, there is absolutely pervasive internet access
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:43.240]   everywhere, every single little shred inch of the world should
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.360]   be covered, and saturated, that should never happen. You know,
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.820]   the people should be able to have closure, they should be
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.340]   able to go and get that plane, recover the bodies, give them
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:53.940]   proper funeral. These are simple things, but they're human
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:56.200]   things that we should be doing as human beings, right? And just
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.380]   think about the IoT. Internet access enables us and the idea
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:03.140]   that we can't do that is shocking. And so I agree with
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:03.460]   you.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:06.960]   Elon's incredible. And I think that within the next five years,
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.140]   we'll probably have pervasive internet access everywhere in
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.860]   the earth. And that's, that's transformational. You know, the
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:17.420]   the second most valuable private company in space is also a
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:21.580]   company that, you know, I invested in led the series A
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:25.340]   called relativity space and their idea, which I think will
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:30.160]   help everybody that wants to go to Mars and other places is, why
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.860]   don't we just 3d print the rockets?
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:36.460]   And why don't we 3d print the engines? And why don't we make
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.940]   that functionally useful, because it basically takes the
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:43.840]   cost of a rocket and divides it by 10. And these printers are
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.040]   small enough where you know, you can actually send them to and
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.920]   dismantle them and take them with you to Mars and set them up
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.440]   there. And all of a sudden, you can print the parts that you
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.640]   need to get back to Earth as an example. So I think that
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:01.780]   additive manufacturing has an enormous upside here in space.
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.740]   Um,
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:04.900]   and I think that that's another area that's going to be really,
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:05.380]   really
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.500]   anybody read Andy Weir's Hail Mary yet, the guy who did the
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:12.460]   Martian. He's a science fiction author, it's really great,
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.860]   because you don't actually know what you're gonna find out there.
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.980]   I think that's one of the things that, you know, to to
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.380]   freeberg's point, what do we find out there? What if we find
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:25.360]   a compound out there, that like, plutonium has some attributes
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   that we could leverage in very small amounts to create unlimited
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.900]   energy or unlimited prosperity in some ways there are there are
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:32.380]   there are
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:35.080]   things that can exist that we have not been exposed to. And of
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:38.080]   course, the probability is there are many things that we have yet
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.040]   to be exposed to.
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:39.880]   100%
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:45.820]   Yeah, look, I don't subscribe to to that thesis. I'll tell you.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:49.540]   I'll tell you why. And this maybe also speaks a little bit
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.540]   to some of the counterpoints against the space industry
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:56.020]   getting the attention and resourcing it has relative to
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:58.840]   call it other places to allocate capital and human resourcing.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.020]   And that is like the tool that we use.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.600]   The tools that we have in science and engineering today as
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:10.360]   a species continues to expand at kind of a geometric pace, our
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:16.360]   ability to convert any molecule into any other molecule is
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.080]   basically fulfilled now. It's a function at this point of how
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.680]   much energy and time it takes to do that work. So almost all
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.960]   industry, the function of industry is to convert molecules
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.440]   from one form to another. And we have tools ranging from hardware
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.660]   engineering, mechanical engineering, and more and more
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.600]   recently in the early 20th century, chemical engineering,
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.880]   and in the 21st century, biochemical engineering, those
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:43.120]   tools are allowing us to invent, discover and convert molecules
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:49.280]   and even in some cases, kind of elemental forms that into nearly
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.940]   anything else we want to produce. And the technology is
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.000]   accelerating in such a way the set of technologies compound
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.280]   that if you think about 100 years from now, 200 years from
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.300]   now, 500 years from now, the human species theoretically, for
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.240]   very minimal time and very minimal energy should be able to
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   have something that looks akin today to the Star Trek
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.200]   replicator, you basically type into a device what you'd like to
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.140]   make, and it makes it for you in a few minutes. And you could
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.540]   just like Mr. Fusion and Back to the Future two, you could put
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.560]   any input you want into the thing, you could throw in
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.580]   bananas and cans and whatever, and outcomes this thing you want
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.700]   to make. So as the human species evolved towards that capability,
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.260]   and we don't need to get into the details, that's just like
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:30.940]   the general trendline, it becomes less relevant that we need to go
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:34.300]   get other molecules or go get other things from extra
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.420]   planetary sources. The planet Earth has, you know, the order of
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:42.820]   10 to the 23rd atoms, you know, two thirds of the surface is
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:46.840]   water, there is so much that is like unexplored and untapped
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.720]   from a resource perspective within this this spaceship that
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.740]   we're already on, that the argument would be made that our
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.520]   technology is allowing us to effectively recreate all of our
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.420]   fantastic dreams, right here where we live today. And, you
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.580]   know, first thing we're gonna have to do is
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.460]   fix this planet and fix the ecosystems that are kind of at
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:07.120]   risk. But as we progress, and as these technologies progress, we
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.580]   can do these extraordinary things that we don't necessarily
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.940]   need to rely on extra planetary travel and colonization in order
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:15.460]   to achieve those objectives. So that's, that's, that's, that's
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.380]   the that's the optimistic counter argument.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.140]   Yeah, but we keep finding things like these molecules and
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.580]   Titan's atmosphere, etc, that we can't explain. And we're
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.820]   finding those through telescopes, let alone we get out
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.220]   there. I mean, we might be able to create them. Sure.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.980]   Yeah. But we're going to discover them in other places,
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:36.340]   we they may be beyond our human comprehension that these things
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.360]   could even exist, David,
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.640]   there are interesting things we're seeing there, for sure. And
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.860]   I think, you know, there's a I think I mentioned this book
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.900]   before, it's so esoteric and difficult, but it's called Every
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.380]   Life is on Fire by this guy named Jeremy England. And he
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.600]   highlights how all of evolution is effectively predicted by
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.440]   statistical physics, and the energy bath and the molecules
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.420]   within a system,
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.100]   create a
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:05.140]   structure of molecules that you wouldn't see, except for that
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.380]   condition, meaning that over time, the complexity of that
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:12.700]   system evolves to create an equilibrium with the energy
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:17.020]   that it's that it's covered in. So what we see on planet Earth,
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.480]   he argues is organic molecules in what we call life, which are
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.140]   these molecules that are really good at copying themselves to
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:26.860]   absorb energy and dissipate energy. So the molecules and the
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.980]   energy state of, you know, Titan is different than what we
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:32.100]   see at Earth. So the way the molecules have evolved there are
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.720]   so different than what we've seen on Earth. And you can see
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.080]   these incredible concept of what we we wouldn't call life today,
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.220]   but really could be defined as life there. And so there's
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:44.480]   certainly a lot to learn a lot to explore. It doesn't mean that
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.840]   we're limited in terms of our ability to kind of realize those
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.700]   things here on planet Earth. But you're absolutely right. Like
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.740]   exploration is the core of being a human, right.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.720]   And for people who don't know, Titan is one of the, it's the
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.860]   largest moon of Saturn. And it's got its own really weird
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:04.960]   dense atmosphere that's icy and slushy. And we don't even we
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.580]   can't even comprehend half the stuff going on there yet.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.860]   Would any of you guys take the Richard Branson trip? Would you
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.240]   do the you know, like next week or two years? I guess at what
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.140]   point would you be comfortable taking it? I'm sure you've
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:17.960]   taken your your side.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.540]   I can answer for sacks. The answer is no.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.100]   600 and 600 and something. So
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.840]   how many flights more would you want to see? You would want to
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.440]   do 10 more flights 20 more flights? No, I feel I feel really
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:29.740]   confident.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:32.260]   That we know what we're doing the this flight was so critical
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.140]   because it was about figuring out what it was like to have
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.840]   passengers in the back and how they'd all behave when you had
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.120]   multiple folks. And I think once that readout is done, and
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.400]   Richard apparently took a bunch of notes. So you know, we'll,
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.540]   we'll be starting commercial ops, I think, you know, the
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.800]   next two or three quarters. So Wow. Yeah, when you have
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:59.560]   well, I mean, if I had a $500 million super yacht, like Jeff
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.900]   Bezos, that's where I'd be hanging out. I don't think I'd
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.680]   be blasting. I wouldn't be blasting myself into space. But
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.980]   I mean, look more power to them. I mean, they got, you know, they
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:13.660]   certainly have got guts. Yeah, he's doing both. Yeah. Jake,
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.320]   how would you do it?
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.600]   I you know, I my my theory is with kids, I kind of think
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.540]   differently about it. But if I was over 70, like Branson,
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.440]   certainly I would do it. Yeah, I would have to have that
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.260]   conversation with my spouse and my kids and say, you know, hey,
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:34.000]   this opportunity exists. They've done let's call it 100 flights.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.760]   Somewhere in that neighborhood, I would I think I would feel
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.920]   pretty comfortable doing it. But I would want to check in with
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.340]   my family and kids and see if we were all in sync on taking that
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.520]   lever. I stopped riding motorcycles as an example. I
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.820]   think that flying and space tourism in the next year or two
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:52.100]   will be safer than riding a motorcycle. And then eventually
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.900]   it'll be safer than, you know, driving a car or something. It's
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:59.380]   quite possible. I was I was watching a space show with my
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.320]   daughter. She's three years old on the couch the other day. And
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.700]   then she she was like, Oh, space, it looks so fun. And I'm
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.860]   like, make you I said, Do you want to go to space? And she
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:11.200]   said, she looked back at me and she said, I want to go to space
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.660]   with you. And it made me cry. It was the first time I'd ever
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:16.360]   thought like, man, I first time you'd ever cried for some ever
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:16.720]   crying.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.700]   Back to his firmware. Yeah, crying. I was like, are these
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:25.960]   water particles on my chin? But I had no desire, I would say
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.420]   before she said that to go to space, but it was a
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:35.260]   moment of like, man, this like, moment of like inspiration of
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.480]   like going to space is something that like, I think is going to
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.600]   inspire, you know, a generation and I told my daughter, I said,
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.040]   you know, you are going to go to space. I hope I can be there
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.120]   with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.120]   Can I give you an idea? Two different ideas, but they're
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.840]   roughly related. When each of your kids turn 18. Buy them a
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.280]   ticket to space so that they become an astronaut, which I
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.140]   think is like a beautiful kind of an idea. We're like, you know,
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.720]   what an incredible present to give somebody as they mature into
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.600]   age, you know, if you if you read if you if you basically
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.840]   have heard all these astronauts have said, you know, the the
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.480]   overview effect, like when you're above the earth looking
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.260]   down, it has this completely transformational effect on your
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:18.940]   outlook on life and the planet. And so, you know, to the extent
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.780]   that that's a quantifiable thing to give that to your child seems
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:27.580]   like an enormous gift or, or when everybody's of age or
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.020]   whatever, where all of your kids are
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.560]   of you guys go as a family so that the whole cabin is your
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.360]   family? That would be really cool to either those ideas. I
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.640]   will do one of those two on a second. There were four people
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.940]   Correct in this fight if I remember. This one, there's
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:43.380]   four passengers. Okay, wait a second. There are four besties.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:47.020]   How are you not setting up a flight for the hundredth
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:51.580]   episode of all in to be on Virgin Galactic? Can you imagine
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:55.460]   watching David cry and be so scared? I mean, I can pretty
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:58.800]   much guarantee you, obviously, you guys have to buy tickets,
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.320]   but I can pretty much guarantee you that if the three of you
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.600]   decided to buy tickets, I'm pretty sure I can organize that
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.920]   we all go on the same flight. That would be ratings bonanza.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.640]   That would be bigger than Saxon and Covenants.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.460]   That's all I need is to be entombed with you guys for
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.180]   eternity.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:20.300]   You know you want it. You know you want it.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:24.660]   Hey, Chamath, can you address the von Karman line controversy
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.360]   around you know, what's the right point to be in space?
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.580]   Because it came up a lot this
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.140]   week in the news. I didn't want to kind of
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.060]   came up by one person.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.800]   Well, no, no, there was people talking about on the news and
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.540]   stuff like maybe you can just share for everyone.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.300]   Blue Origin being lame. Honestly, that's so petty by
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:39.800]   Bezos.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.500]   So maybe just share what happened and kind of, you know,
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.120]   the point of view on this. Be awesome.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.320]   But basically, the question is what defines space, right? So if
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:54.540]   you if you just like start from the bottom from ground level,
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.620]   right, you have the trophosphere, right? So you have
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:58.360]   like the first kind of like, you know, like, you know, like, you
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:58.860]   know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like,
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:08:59.360]   you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like,
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:08:59.740]   you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like,
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:03.700]   1020 kilometers or so right, then you have the stratosphere,
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:07.200]   right? That's where like, a lot of like weather balloon activity
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.860]   happens. That's a 50 kilometers, then you have the mesosphere,
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.060]   right? That's where you'll see things like meteors and stuff.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:17.080]   Then you get to basically the Karman line, which is around I
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.740]   don't know, 100 kilometers or so there are a bunch of countries
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:27.800]   that either have no opinion, or point to this kind of group to
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.140]   define what the stratosphere is.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:31.860]   define what the beginning of space is. And they define that
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:38.320]   at about 100 clicks, which is I want to say 62 miles, okay. Then
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:46.560]   there's the United States. And the DoD and NASA, etc. And we
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.380]   define it at a different level 50 odd miles.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:57.920]   And so in the United States, you need to pass the US regulatory
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.380]   standards. So there's a lot of different ways to define the
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.540]   stratosphere. But I think it's important to understand the
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.980]   definition of what the threshold of space is to be considered an
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:11.720]   astronaut. There is other countries that would then point
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.180]   to a different line, the Karman line has the line. I think the
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:19.340]   point is, it's all much ado about nothing, I think, in the
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.460]   end, I think Virgin stated that they went to 52 and a half or 53
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:27.700]   and a half. You know, things are iterative. So over time, you'll
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:31.320]   get to see the planet, you get to feel microgravity. You know,
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.700]   you get the benefit of the overview effect, whether you're
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.220]   at 52 and a half, I'm guessing you'll get the same effect at
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:41.560]   58 or 60 or 61. And then you come back to Earth. So I thought
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.540]   it was kind of a little cheap and unnecessary,
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.180]   because there's not there's, there's nothing experience wise
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:52.180]   that changes, right? I mean, like the understanding. Yeah.
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:57.480]   Blue Origin did a tweet from a friend of mine, he said, I'm
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.880]   from the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Carmen line. So none of our
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.920]   astronauts would have an asterix next to their name. For 96% of the world's population space
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.240]   begins 100 kilometers up the insurance blah, blah, blah. It's just like, why would they do
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:16.680]   that the days before the Richard Branson goes up. It's just totally classless. It shows that Bezos
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:24.600]   has a competitive streak, which is just not graceful, I would say. And I think there's a
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:30.200]   little bit of bitterness there. And then you look at Elon. What did Elon do? He went so classy.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:35.720]   He went so classy. He took a picture with Branson and he went to support him and wrote a
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:40.520]   congratulatory tweet. Elon does not feel he's in competition. But for some reason, Bezos,
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:47.080]   you know, Bezos had to, like draft and approve this specific tweet from Blue Origin. And I just
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.760]   thought it was classless and just stupid. Jeff really made you look so bad. Elon, Elon was so
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.820]   fabulous. I mean, it just shows you like, what's the difference between the two. I mean, it's just
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:53.820]   like, what's the difference between the two. I mean, it's just like, what's the difference between
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:53.820]   the two. I mean, it's just like, what's the difference between the two. I mean, it's just like, what's
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:53.880]   the difference between the two. I mean, it's just like, what's the difference between the two. I mean,
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   it's just like, what's the difference between the two. I mean, it's just like, what's the difference
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   between the two. I mean, it's just like, what's the difference between the two. I mean, it's just
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.640]   shows you like what a class act he is and what he cares about, which is like he cares about
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:07.320]   advancing humans and our ability to do things that are incredible and inspiring. And when other
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:12.040]   people do it, he's not zero sum about it. As you said, Jason, he was there, he was supportive.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:19.200]   It was just lovely to see. I think Bezos is still stung for when Elon said he couldn't get it up.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:23.560]   Meaning he couldn't get his rocket into space. So, I don't know if that was -
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.880]   That was too classy of Elon.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.720]   Well, it was funny. It was funny.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:36.880]   Well, I don't know if you guys have seen Jeff's rocket. Kind of small. His rocket is, I mean,
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.560]   Jason, now you're doing it.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.600]   Kind of tiny rocket. I'm just joking. Just so we put a pin in it, Melvin Capital,
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.720]   the people who went to war with the Reddit traders or vice versa, lost $5 billion.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.300]   Couldn't happen to a nicer group of people.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.300]   I mean,
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:58.640]   they're down 46%, which is just shocking in and of itself in this kind of upmarket.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:07.100]   But then to actually quantify it, they lost $5 billion fighting a bunch of self-proclaimed Rs.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:12.020]   I won't say the word because I don't want to get canceled, but they call themselves Rs on
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.100]   .
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.000]   On Reddit.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:14.720]   On Redditers.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.000]   They cost them $5 billion.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.260]   Jason, you can say it. You're not calling them that. They call themselves that.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.580]   They call themselves that, yes.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.040]   .
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:29.220]   All right. Listen, love you, besties. Sacks, we're glad that you're safe and you're healthy.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.380]   No thanks to you. No thanks to you.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:35.280]   No jokes. I didn't put any jokes in there. I have so many jokes. I'm going to save them.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.000]   I mean, honestly, my thought on your recovery is no comment.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.160]   I'm just jealous you're going to lose another five fricking pounds because of this.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.080]   Oh, yeah. I'm down to 178, by the way.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.700]   Come on. Stop. Are you really?
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.920]   Stop, you manorexic. I can't even break one.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.600]   When are you going to stop?
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.980]   Was there a bet or no?
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:57.180]   No bet. I don't want to lose that bet. That'd be like me playing sacks in chess.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.020]   It's just not going to-
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:00.180]   Jason, what are you tipping the scales at right now?
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.380]   190. One.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:06.660]   190 and you're about to come to Italy and basically you're going to gain 15 pounds for sure.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.220]   No, I'm doing one meal a day.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:08.760]   What? No.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.000]   One meal a day. That's it. One meal a day. That's it.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.180]   I'm eating one meal a day. That's my good thing.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:18.420]   How are you going to turn down the food? But what if you eat for three hours in that one meal?
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:21.340]   I try everything. I'll just try and then I have discipline now.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:23.980]   Just like I stopped using Twitter. I'm stopping Twitter.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:28.420]   Can I tell one funny story about Jcal in Italy? Talking about discipline? Okay. So,
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:31.780]   we were there in Italy. When was this Jcal? A few years ago, whatever?
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.880]   This is a long time ago. Is this when we were in Venice?
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.940]   Yeah. You were with Jade and I was with Jaqueline.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:37.720]   Oh, that's a great story.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:44.080]   And we went to some ice cream place, right? And so, we all had these like ice cream gelato
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:49.060]   with like two scoops or whatever on there. So, Jason finishes his in like five seconds.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.380]   It would just disappear.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:51.080]   .
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:58.880]   And then he walks up to Jaqueline and just goes like that. And in one fell swoop, he ate
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.000]   the gelato off her ice cream cone.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:02.960]   That's not true. That's not true.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.240]   It was like a bulldog. It was like a bulldog just eating your ice cream.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.360]   But how good was that fish that we got? Remember that restaurant I found?
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.260]   Yeah. The Dorade.
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:13.040]   The Dorade.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.200]   The Dorade. I mean, we still talk about that place. That was incredible.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.760]   Yeah. That was like one of the best meals you ever had.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.120]   I've been having a gelato, guys, every day. Every day.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.460]   But they're so small. That's what I love about the Italian.
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:22.940]   They're so small.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.560]   It's a little – it's such a cute little –
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.440]   And it doesn't feel like there's like a lot of preservatives and stuff in there.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.680]   No. It's just like butter and sugar, heavy cream, whatever it is. It's so good.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.920]   It's so good. It's so good.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.960]   How are the tomatoes right now? I can't wait to see some tomatoes.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.220]   Oh, incredible. Incredible. I mean, I eat them, I bathe in them, I rub them on my face.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:45.080]   You rub them all. What about the moots? You got the moots? How's the burrata and the moots? I can't
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:45.320]   wait.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.680]   Oh, he's going to gain 15 pounds.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.160]   100% he's going to break.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:49.920]   Look at him. Look at him.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.360]   100%.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.320]   We should do a weigh-in when we get there and a weigh-in at the end. That would be the bet.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.440]   I don't know how you're going to turn down this food. I don't know how you're going to say no to
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.040]   the pasta. You'll have pasta at lunch, pasta at dinner. You're just going to go crazy.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:08.100]   I'm going to just have two bites of everything. Two bites of six different pastas, and I'll be fine.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:18.360]   By the way, by the way, the best kept secret is the quality of Italian white wine is outrageous.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:18.840]   Really?
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.720]   Really.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.800]   It is outrageous.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.840]   We should play some cards and drink some wine.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.880]   I think we're going to play. No?
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.000]   How many calories are in the white wine, Chamath?
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.580]   Calories? I don't know. I mean, I have no idea. But look, the thing in the summertime here is you
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:38.560]   end up walking. So I end up walking a lot or bicycling a little bit, blah, blah, blah. At the
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.540]   end of the day, you're burning through everything.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.420]   I got to say, this e-bike I got, I got a rad power bike.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:47.560]   No, no, no. The whole point is to not have a motor that powers it, you fucking lazy bastard.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.000]   No, no, no. What you don't understand is,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.140]   because you have the motor in it, Chamath, you ride your bike normal. But then like,
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.260]   let's say you do have dinner or something like that, or you want to go to dinner 10 miles away
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:00.820]   or 15 miles away, you might not take your bike. It's too long of a ride. With these electric bikes,
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:05.260]   instead of going 10 miles on the way there, it takes your 10 mile ride and just puts you at 25,
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.380]   but you're still burning the same number of calories. It's like augmenting.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:13.660]   I really think that electric bikes are going to change cities like in a major way. They're already
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:18.100]   starting to in Europe and in China. But all right, everybody, we'll see you next time on the All In
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.560]   the Podcast. Love you, Sax. Back at you.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.780]   Sax, I hope you get better.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:23.800]   Feel better.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.060]   Thank you. Thanks, guys. I'm better. I'm already better. Don't worry about it.
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.220]   And wait, Freeburg, you have nothing to say. Computer.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.500]   It does not compute.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.460]   It is nice to see the three of you.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:38.200]   It was nice to check off the box for my social interactions for the week.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.400]   I will now go back.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:45.040]   I have now done 75 minutes of social interaction, powering down in three, two, one.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.480]   Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.920]   See you next time. Bye-bye.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.020]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.860]   Rain Man, David Sack.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:18:00.760]   And it said, we open source it to the fans, and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.520]   I love you, West Navy.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.140]   I'm the queen of quinoa.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:04.680]   I'm going all in.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.300]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:10.940]   Besties are gone.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.440]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.200]   Oh, man.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:23.840]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy, because they're all just useless.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.020]   It's like this sexual tension, but they just need to release it somehow.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.520]   Wet your feet.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.740]   Wet your feet.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.820]   We need to get merchies.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.780]   I'm going all in.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:44.740]   I'm going all in.
