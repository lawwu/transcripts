[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - Lately on the podcast, we've covered a lot of ground
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.040]   on work-related questions,
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.320]   advice for Christians who work Sunday mornings,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.180]   how to avoid idolizing a career, things like that.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.520]   Today's question is about workplace competence.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.340]   If I consistently fail at work,
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.240]   is God calling me to quit?
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.220]   It's a good, honest question from a young woman
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.900]   stuck inside a vocational dilemma.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.720]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.840]   I'm simply not good at my job.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.080]   That's the truth of it.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.940]   I've met with my bosses to figure out what to improve.
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.560]   I've implemented those things.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.200]   Nothing seems to work.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.320]   I'm a teacher and my students' academic success
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.700]   is being affected.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.640]   I'm tempted to resign for their sake.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.600]   However, I did feel like the Lord called me here.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.120]   Now I wonder if I heard wrong.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.160]   Can you give me advice?
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.600]   What role does success play
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.560]   in discerning my vocational calling?
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.700]   Let's begin with two biblical guidelines
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.640]   about our sense of calling in life.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.600]   And then a couple of illustrations from my own life
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   and maybe even my wife, Noel, that might be helpful.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600]   First guideline, the subjective sense of our calling
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.600]   should be confirmed by our objective fitness
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.960]   for the calling.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.840]   That's the guideline.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560]   Or here's another way to put it, perhaps.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.560]   Our personal sense of calling should be informed
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160]   by objective criteria that might include biblical truth
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.360]   or might include personal competencies or both.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.560]   We see the guidelines when we turn to the New Testament
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.320]   and consider the calling, for example,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.960]   to eldership or pastoring in the church.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.240]   I think it's gonna apply in general.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.880]   And so I'm drawing out a guideline
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.560]   from what the New Testament says,
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.800]   what Paul says about the qualification
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.160]   or the calling of an elder in 1 Timothy 3.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.400]   He says this, "If anyone aspires,"
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.360]   now there's a subjective experience that a man is having.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.360]   "If anyone aspires to the office of overseer
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.520]   or elder or pastor, he desires,"
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.040]   and there's another subjective expression,
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.560]   "He desires a noble task."
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.400]   So there's this aspiration, there's this desire.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.920]   He senses that this would be a gratifying,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.160]   fruitful way to spend my life.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.160]   And then Paul adds this, "Therefore, an overseer must be,"
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.280]   and then he gives 15 measurable qualifications.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.840]   And you kind of say, "Whoa, I thought his desire
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.560]   and his aspiration is the key thing."
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.920]   And of course, it is key.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.240]   Nobody's gonna be an elder
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.320]   if he doesn't have the God-given passion for it.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.200]   And one of those 15 qualifications is able to teach.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.160]   So I think this would mean that if time and experience
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160]   prove that a man's teaching ministry is unhelpful
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.400]   or even harmful, and I don't mean to communicate
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.440]   that you need to be a great teacher to be a good pastor,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.520]   just competent, just competent, helpful.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.080]   People get help when you open the Bible.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.160]   It would probably mean,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.240]   like if he proved to be unhelpful or harmful,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.800]   it would probably mean that either a mistake was made
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.040]   in discerning his calling
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.920]   and he should seek another kind of ministry,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   or maybe he just lost his ability.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.760]   That does happen.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   A man can lose capacities that he had 50 years ago.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.640]   And he might no longer be apt to teach
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.560]   and therefore no longer qualified to be an elder.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.160]   So the first guideline is this.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.160]   In general, the subjective sense of our calling from God
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.840]   should be informed, confirmed
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.520]   by the objective fitness for the calling.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.600]   Here's the second guideline for our sense of calling.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.760]   God intends each of his children,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.320]   and I would say each of his creatures, even unbelievers,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   in general to be good at some things
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.480]   and not good at other things.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.520]   He intends every human being to be good at some things
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.280]   and not good at other things so that they fit together.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.760]   Now I'm thinking about the Christians now.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   They fit together like a diverse body, body parts,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.120]   not like links in a chain.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.320]   Links in a chain are all the same,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.720]   and the chain works precisely
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.520]   because each link does the same thing.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.760]   It holds.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.800]   A link doesn't hold like all the other links are holding.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.680]   The whole chain doesn't work.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.880]   Paul's picture of the church,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.520]   and I think it's a good guideline for life in general,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.680]   is this.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.200]   The body does not consist of one member but of many.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.680]   If the whole body were an eye,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.360]   where would be the sense of hearing?
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.280]   If the whole body were an ear,
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.240]   where would be the sense of smell?
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.320]   But as it is, God arranged the members of the body,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.240]   each one of them, as he chose.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.320]   As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   So an ear is not good at being an eye.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.920]   An eye is not good at being an ear.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   So to be not good at something is not a condemnation.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.760]   Goodness gracious, how many things I'm not good at.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.120]   I would just die if I had to feel bad about all those.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.880]   It's not even a loss, Paul says.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.840]   If you find what you are made for
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.480]   and you know how you fit in the world,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.240]   this is just a glorious plus,
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.840]   even if you can't do many other things.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.080]   It does require some humility
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.840]   because you can ruin your life
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.680]   with envy of others' competencies.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.360]   A finger can make his life totally miserable
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.520]   by wishing every day he were an elbow.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.440]   And I've had to work hard
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.200]   because there are certain things that as a scholar,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.280]   I'm supposed to be better at, supposedly,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.040]   and I've just had to preach to myself over the years,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.040]   "Piper, you're never gonna be like this, so get over it.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.080]   You have to just do what you can do
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.240]   and stop trying to be an elbow."
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.480]   So I would say these two guidelines suggest
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   that if we find ourselves in a position
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.120]   that does not fit with our competencies
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.480]   and it becomes evident to others
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.400]   that our efforts are not effective
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.240]   in accomplishing the goals of the position,
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.040]   then God is probably leading us to another kind of work.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.600]   So let me give two illustrations
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.480]   from my life and Noel's life together
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.880]   that might be encouraging.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.080]   I hope they are.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.720]   I hope that it won't be too disconcerting
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.040]   that a job change might be fitting.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.360]   In the spring of 1966,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.640]   finishing my sophomore year in college,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.120]   I was overwhelmed with a sweet confidence
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.640]   that finally God had made it plain
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.040]   that I should pursue a pre-med course
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.760]   and aim at the vocation of medical doctor.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.680]   Oh, what a relief it was to finally know
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.520]   after two years in college of just being a lit major
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.640]   and not knowing what I was gonna do.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.080]   So much so that I changed my summer plans,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.560]   took chemistry to catch up with the pre-med sequence,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.480]   but as you know, things did not go the way I planned.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.080]   I did not like chemistry and that is an understatement.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.840]   And at the end of that summer,
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.640]   I got mononucleosis, spent three weeks in the health center.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.560]   And during that time,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.080]   I heard a kind of preaching on the radio
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.720]   that lit a fire in me for biblical studies
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.360]   and teaching and preaching and writing
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.800]   that to this day, 53 years later, has never died.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.640]   I'm as thrilled about being a Bible guy today
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.400]   as I was when I was 20 years old in that health center
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.720]   and so excited.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   So I would say I misread God's calling in the spring of '66.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:42.960]   I heard truly God's call in the fall of '66
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.000]   because experience has validated
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.120]   that sense of hearing and call.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.400]   And if you were to ask me,
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.640]   so here's a little lesson in providence.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.920]   If you were to ask me today
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.640]   why God would permit such a detour,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   such a misreading of His will for my life,
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.080]   my answer would probably be
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.800]   so that I would meet Noelle Henry
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.880]   in the summer of 1966 while taking chemistry
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.400]   and marry the woman who was the perfect fit
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.560]   for my calling as a Bible guy all these years.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.160]   I met her on my detour.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160]   I would not have met Noelle
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.480]   had I gone straight to the ministry in May of '66
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.160]   instead of September of '66.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   I love the providence of God.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.760]   So one more story that this may be very, very helpful to,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.920]   the one who wrote in.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.440]   A few months into our marriage in 1968
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.680]   in Pasadena, California,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.880]   Noelle had taken a job at Caltech,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.200]   big high-powered educational institution,
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.880]   where the expectations had not been made clear to her or me.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.960]   She was drowning in duties
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.560]   for which she had not been prepared.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.480]   So I came home one afternoon
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.480]   and found her sitting on the side of the bed crying,
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.920]   and I was shocked and scared,
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.320]   and I said, "What happened?"
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.880]   And through her tears, she said, "I've been fired."
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.680]   That was a really low point
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.480]   in our little brand-new, what, two-month-old marriage.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.960]   Within a month, she had found a new job,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   and three years later,
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.320]   when we were leaving Pasadena for grad school,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.200]   she was so loved, so needed, so admired in that job
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.920]   that they didn't want to let us go.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.520]   So all of that to say,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.280]   we can seriously misread our sense of calling,
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.640]   and we can find ourselves in jobs
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.680]   for which we are not suited.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.640]   And to adjust our sense of calling
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   and to find a new job is nothing to be ashamed of
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.000]   if we are humble enough to admit that we're fallible
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.960]   and that we're not omnicompetent.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.200]   - Yeah, amen, and God has a plan for us,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.640]   even inside the detours.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.120]   - Amen, yes, exactly.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.960]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.040]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that counsel
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.520]   and for those personal stories as well.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.320]   And wherever you're listening in the midst of your day,

[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.320]   Well, what is the deepest longing of the human heart?
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.320]   What's your deepest longing?
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.840]   What's the thing you want most?
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.480]   What craving is behind all the other desires
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.720]   that you have in your life?
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.320]   There's an answer to that question,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.720]   and Pastor John has it from scripture for us next time.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.840]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.200]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
