[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.660]   money and travel. If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins. And one of the
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280]   things I love optimizing the most is credit card points and miles. So today I wanted to
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.760]   invite my good friend and absolute credit card expert Sebastian Fung, better known on
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.820]   YouTube by his handle AskSevi, to talk about the current state of credit cards, predictions
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.100]   for next year, some of the recent changes we've been seeing, I'm looking at you Delta,
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.040]   how to think about signup bonuses versus spending multipliers, how frequently you can open up
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.120]   cards and a lot more. So let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.640]   Sebastian, thank you for being here in person. Thank you for having me.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.880]   For people who don't know you, I gave a little bit of an intro, but tell me about how you
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.880]   got into this game.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.240]   I kind of started my career in finance, moved into tech, did a bunch of startup stuff, and
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.640]   then got very obsessed of points, mostly because my player two, Mandy, wanted to travel a ton.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.820]   And I was like, how do I do all this stuff without paying an arm and a leg? I think one
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.860]   big trip that really pushed it was a last minute Japan trip. And we paid something like
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.660]   12 or $1,300 for economy. And I'm like, wait, why am I paying so much money for economy?
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.940]   And then I fell into this whole points rabbit hole. I knew about credit cards before, but
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.580]   I was always on team cashback back in the day where I was like, oh, just optimize your
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.980]   categories and that makes the most sense. But then I realized you can get so much more
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.980]   value from points.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.140]   And that actually moves the needle the most compared to cashback. I like cashback. I think
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.620]   a lot of people can benefit from it, especially if you have a family and you're not traveling
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.180]   as much or you just don't care about that. But I think especially when you're young,
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.140]   points drive so much value and just open so many doors.
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.820]   Is there a type of travel you think is necessary for points to be worth it?
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.540]   I think it does lean more towards aspirational business and first class type of trips or
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.560]   more expensive trips. For economy stuff, I still pay out of pocket generally because
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.860]   the value is not there, or I get okay value like maybe 1.5 to 2 cents per point, but it's
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.980]   not the astronomical 10 cents per point. So for me, a lot of it is how do I as a P get
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.780]   the VIP experience and unlock this whole thing that I didn't think I could do.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.140]   Growing up pretty lower middle class, I never thought I'd be able to fly business, let alone
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.460]   first. So the fact that even if it's just for a few hours, see what it's like to be
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.740]   on the other side and experience that and see these other people who are dropping 20K
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.380]   on these flights, that's nice.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.980]   It feels really good to sit next to someone and be like, how much did you pay? I haven't
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.340]   actually asked. I don't know if you ever asked, but I've always wanted to ask. How much did
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.340]   you pay for that?
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.740]   I've done that in Bora where we were just hanging out and talking to other people. And
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.020]   then some people were like, oh, I pay 30. And then someone else was like, oh, you guys
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.340]   are losers. We did it through Costco and we paid 25,000. And I was like, oh, I didn't
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.540]   pay that much money at all. But it went first or bubble.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.420]   I know, but you kind of did just to open them. But next time, here's the tricks.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.640]   A lot of people like the idea of points, but it's one of those things that you keep in
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.180]   mind, but you never really act on it. A lot of people will be like, oh, we can get a lot
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.060]   of value. That's nice, whatever. So it is tough to make that switch. And like that first
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.560]   step is always harder.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.340]   So I want to come back to these aspirational trips at the end. But first, I feel like there
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.340]   are very few people that are as in tune with everything that's going on with the points,
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.980]   miles, status world. I wanted to just bring up the topic of where we're at right now.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.540]   We're recording this in September 2023. Delta has just told everyone that loves flying Delta
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.060]   that it's going to be a lot harder to get status unless you spend a ridiculous amount
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.460]   of money. By this point, we probably already will have covered the major news there. But
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.820]   at the high level, status is changing and it has on other airlines over the past few
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.820]   years.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.420]   Where do you feel like things are in the world of points and miles? What's happening now?
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.620]   So I feel like most of the airlines have told people either intentionally or unintentionally
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.540]   that they actually don't care if you fly them a lot. They care more so how much money you
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.360]   spend with them. So even if you look at your net, it's changed from the old system to the
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.140]   current one. It's very much contingent on you spending either a crap ton of money on
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.060]   your credit cards or flying a lot of them.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.340]   It's not even economy flying. They do want premium last minute business class type flying
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.460]   where you might be going to the airport and paying $1,000 for like SFO to LAX. So Delta
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.000]   is kind of in that same realm. They have simplified the whole process a lot more, but it's still
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.460]   very much targeted towards businesses. Even back in the day, you could get two Delta Reserve
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.300]   cards. Spending your way there was about $240K, but it was complicated. You were learning
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.140]   about MQT waivers, MQM boosts and stuff like that. And now it's like just spend $400K and
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.500]   you get status or $350K. A lot of money for most businesses.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.100]   Do you care about status? At least let's start with airlines. Is that something you're even
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.380]   trying to get anymore?
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.580]   So I think a lot of people rightfully don't like status for a lot of good reasons because
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.060]   they don't get upgrades. So back in the day, we were chasing United status. And then I
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.060]   think the most we ever got up to was Platinum. And then we realized that out of SFO because
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.160]   43 or 50% of people flying through SFO are United. So you're never going to get upgraded
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.500]   because there's too many people that have 1K and global services that you can chase
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.820]   it, but it's not going to help you as much as you think it is. So you pretty much want
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.020]   to get status with the second or third busiest airline from that airport. And for us, SFO,
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.620]   it was Delta. And then if you're in Atlanta, obviously, you wouldn't want Delta because
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.740]   there's too many Delta elite members and people who like just have unlimited corporate account
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.740]   money.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.120]   So for us, we got Delta status. We liked it a lot because we were getting upgraded for
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.180]   our cross-country flights. We also fly during weird times. So that kind of helps. But being
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.500]   able to get a decent business class seat for five or six hours is nice.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.740]   With the new change, I think we're kind of on the fence about how to play it. So next
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.820]   year, we're still going to be Delta Diamond. The year after that, I think unless we have
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.700]   some weird astronomical business spend, it just doesn't make sense. And then even then
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.700]   it's like, well, there's an opportunity cost of should I spend all this money on this card
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.820]   when I can just use a Citi Double Cash or a lot of other cards where you get more value,
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.660]   right? We might chase American status mostly because the spend amount seems pretty reasonable
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.900]   for the level that we want.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.580]   And then for that level, pretty much the one below eXp, so I think it's Platinum Pro, that
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.180]   one gets you One World Emerald status, which gets you into first class lounges when you're
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.460]   flying abroad. So we go to Hong Kong like three to four times a year. And if I can scroll
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.900]   up into the Cafe Pacific first class lounge while flying Economy or Premium Economy, that's
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.900]   not bad at all.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.260]   No, it's funny. My adventures with status started with let's try to chase the highest
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.060]   status on United because we lived in San Francisco. And then it was, well, we're really only taking
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.940]   short haul trips where I just don't care, or really long haul trips where we're using
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.900]   our points. Forget it, no status. So for the last four or five years, no status.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.140]   And the one place where it started to bite us back was now we have two kids and we have
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.260]   an au pair. And sometimes we're traveling with five people, four seats. And the reality,
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.940]   we just did a trip with no check bags. But the reality is when you're traveling with
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.780]   four or five people with a bunch of kids, you got to check bags. And it was just an
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.500]   added fee. So it was like, do I want to get a credit card to cover the cost? Or there
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.060]   was a challenge for United, which was just in reach. It was spend $1,200 in three or
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.500]   four months on United. And we had a couple trips planned. So I went for it.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.540]   And now I'm worried that I'm kind of getting caught up in this. For anyone listening who
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.860]   knows United status, silver basically is free check bags. Economy plus it check in if it
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.100]   happens to be available. So it's not special, but I'm finally back on that train. And now
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.380]   I find myself doing what I wanted to not do, which was I just want to take the easiest,
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.380]   most convenient flight.
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.060]   Now I find myself like, "Ooh, can I take the United flight? Because I'm going to get free
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.060]   check bags."
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.980]   I'll just get a credit card then. I feel like that makes so much more sense. You get all
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.420]   the perks of silver or even gold status.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.740]   I think it's because I had a United card for so long. And then I just forgot to put a transaction
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.140]   on it and they closed it. And I was like, "Ugh, do I have to really go back and get
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.700]   another new United card?"
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.160]   It's another intro bonus.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.060]   So we'll come to that. But it seemed like it fit in. So I did it. We're going to get
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.420]   some free checked bags out of it. But at the end of the day, the credit card can give you
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.540]   the low tier of status, which is like check bags. You're probably not going to get preferred
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.860]   seats with any cards.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.140]   But with the United cards, Delta does get you upgrades, even if you don't have status,
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.500]   but you're not going to get business or first. And even first is domestic first, which isn't
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.600]   that exciting, but you'll probably get a premium comfort plus equivalent.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.020]   So I'll probably play the cards through that. What about hotels? We don't talk a lot about
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.740]   hotel status. It feels like in the points and miles world, it's Hyatt, Globalist, or
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.740]   forget it.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.380]   I think a big part of it too is because airline status is so hard to get with credit cards
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.820]   while a hotel status is given out willy nilly. So you have all these cards that give you
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.660]   either mid level or even higher level status. Hilton Diamond being one of the prime examples,
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.300]   right? You're getting a top level status by getting a credit card that runs you 450. And
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.000]   then I would argue that the card actually is a net positive because of all the credits
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.220]   and the free night. So you have all these people that have status because the math makes
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.400]   sense and people that watch YouTube are like, Oh, yeah, if you run the numbers, it's logical.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.920]   So I think the reason people like Hyatt is because that's the one you actually had to
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.780]   chase and had to do, meaning that there's less people that have it, meaning that it's
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.340]   more beneficial because upgrades actually come to you if you have like 10,000 people
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.680]   that have status compared to 1000 that's up, especially in the US. Internationally, though,
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.540]   it doesn't really matter because everyone else doesn't have status. So we'll go to Southeast
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.060]   Asia like Da Nang or something. And they'll be like, Oh, thank you for being diamond and
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.520]   for your two stays this year. And I was like, Yeah, thank you for having me because they
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.820]   don't see that many business travelers and their credit cards don't come with status
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.820]   like ours do.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.620]   We've had that experience in Southeast Asia also with Marriott or the former Starwood.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.300]   Any status was great. And I think Marriott, you can also get platinum with one card.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.820]   Marriott, you can get it with the Bonvoy Brilliant now before you had to spend 75k to get it.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.020]   And yeah, now you get it, which I think is good because a lot of hotels can be free breakfast
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.700]   as well and then upgrades up to like standard suites.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.020]   Is there a hotel chain that if you were building loyalty, is it Hyatt? I found recently on
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.920]   Hilton when I dug into the terms, even if there's a nice room, they don't have to give
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   it to you.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.260]   I think a lot of Hilton's are annoying in that way because they'll lean into the terms
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.940]   and then it depends on who owns the hotel and their upgrade policies, but they lean
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.740]   very literally on the can give you an upgrade versus a will give you an upgrade.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.420]   But theoretically, it just depends on the person.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.380]   And then sometimes if you're nicer to them, I find that they are more likely to give you
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.380]   upgrades.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.540]   In the US, they just don't.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.500]   Sometimes I'll open up the app and be like, Hey, there is a junior suite available.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.980]   There's three of them tonight.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.980]   Can I get upgraded to this?
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.780]   It's like, Oh, it's not available in my system.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.060]   I get that they maybe have sales quotas, but still, it's annoying on that end.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.020]   Are there any chains where you feel like you haven't had that problem?
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.940]   Because I imagine you probably have hotel status on all of the chains.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.660]   I feel like Hyatt is one of the best ones for that.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.980]   That's why I like Hyatt, but their footprint so much smaller.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.540]   IHG is probably the worst with it, where even if you have like ambassador or like the top
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.440]   level status, they'll try to upsell you.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.620]   We stayed at an intercontinental and it was empty.
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.620]   It was during Christmas in Houston, and they were just trying to upsell us rooms.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.900]   We're like, Oh, can we get a tour of it?
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.900]   And I was filming the room.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.100]   So I'm like, still got a free review of the room out of it.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.940]   But then it's like, yeah, that'll be an extra 200.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.940]   Isn't this nice?
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.100]   I'm like, I think our hotel is not that busy.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   It's Christmas Eve.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.900]   Why are you trying to upsell me?
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.140]   And so if we look ahead, because I feel like you have a pretty good sense of this, we'll
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.180]   start with status and then we'll move into credit cards.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.180]   But where do you think 2024?
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.180]   What are we going to see?
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.340]   Are we going to see lots of big changes to programs?
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.900]   Do you think they've all made their changes recently, focusing airlines on spend and hotels,
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.660]   I guess, haven't really made too many changes?
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.180]   Is anything changing?
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.300]   American can be really smart here.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.660]   And they could actually even do campaigns where they bring TELTA people over and convert
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.700]   them really well.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.020]   So I think they should do that, but they're not doing it.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.700]   United's in a good spot where they're like, we don't really care.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.980]   I wonder if Delta will backstep the decision, but I feel like they won't.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.080]   So some people pointed to the fact that like they did make some changes because people
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.780]   complain and petitioned and that it took two years or something.
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.480]   But I'm like, is it really worth your effort doing it?
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   Number one.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.180]   And number two, even if they do make a change, it's probably still going to be like a mid
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.040]   step where it's just not going to be good for you anyways.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.600]   So I think there are a lot of people pushing for change and telling people to call the
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.700]   board of directors.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.260]   But it feels like a fiduciary move.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.060]   They made a decision that makes sense for the company.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.520]   I've heard the argument that Delta has the best product, like the best hard product on
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.240]   the plane, seats, service, amenities, everything.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.340]   And so they can kind of afford to do this, because if you live in Atlanta, are you really
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.800]   going to change what you do?
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.180]   And then American doesn't have the best product.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.540]   And so they're like, we're going to make our program work for anyone.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.440]   And Delta is kind of like, look, we're really good.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.300]   We don't need as easy of a program and it might work.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.140]   And I think it will actually attract the people they want, because even if in the diamond
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.500]   rings, there are a lot of people that have status.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.260]   So by moving the bar higher up, that means there's less diamonds, but probably more people
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.220]   that are higher off with businesses that spend more money that want to buy these tickets
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.620]   who spend a lot on their credit cards.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.380]   So it kind of just works out for them where they have a better experience within the diamond
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.380]   ring.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.020]   So not everyone here is focused on status on hotels or airlines, but I think a lot of
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.700]   people here are focused on credit cards.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.940]   What do you think is changing?
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.500]   The only big changes recently, and I say big, like if I look back over 2023, I don't feel
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.040]   like there was a lot that changed in the credit card game.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   But what do you think?
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.660]   I think it's mostly the Venture X coming into the ecosystem and then disrupting everything.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.540]   And now the Venture X business kind of disrupting on the business side.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.220]   I would argue that even that card is actually the best business card out there.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.300]   If you can use the credits and points and stuff, I think we probably at some point we'll
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.940]   see a bit more devaluation over there because it's kind of the Chase Sapphire Reserve strategy
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.340]   where you come in, break down doors, but then you have to take a few steps back afterwards
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.980]   and either increase the annual fee or decrease in benefits after you get the market share.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.820]   I think Citi is the big question mark that a lot of people have because they got rid
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.520]   of the prestige card and they haven't really been in this travel ecosystem.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.480]   For a long time, they were actually in first place and the Platinum pushed past it.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.060]   I think back in like 2017, all the consultants had the Citi prestige because it was like
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.560]   an amazing card where they had this fourth night free perk.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.480]   And if you were traveling for four nights every week, you would actually just get a
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.660]   ton of statement credits and kind of free money through your credit card.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.100]   So the question is whether they're going to try to come back into the top three or whether
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.740]   they'll try to go for the top again and how they play that.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.900]   It seems like Citi has, there's rumors that a new card is coming.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.900]   The Strata Elite and Strata.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.900]   But we don't know what it is.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.020]   We have no clue what it looks like or what it's going to do or whether it's going to
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.020]   be competitive.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.280]   For all we know, they could come into the ecosystem and then if it's just like the luxury
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.940]   black card that is expensive but isn't good, then it's going to lose.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.820]   I've heard someone make very, very edge cases for Citi points, but if you already have some
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.860]   Amex points or Chase and Capital One, adding Citi doesn't get you many new options other
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.100]   than I think Eva Air.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.460]   And then Eva Air is not even that good of an option.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.460]   No.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.320]   In that case, go get a Citi card so you get some points.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.780]   I just think that was the only one that stood out as the unique option.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.780]   I'm at Flowny Bear.
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.020]   Business class on Eva is great.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.020]   Even economy is great.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.020]   They're just very friendly.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.340]   And I think they make some of their space available just to their program.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.580]   So maybe that's a Citi point benefit.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.980]   I think for most people, the reason they go for Citi is because you've depleted all your
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.340]   Chase options and then Amex is once in a lifetime and then it's easy to deplete those options
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.100]   as well because there's only so many MR earning cards and then you do Capital One generally
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.100]   early on.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.460]   So I think Citi is that next logical step and the fact that they do have some pretty
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:15.420]   good cards of catch all options as multipliers, double cash being the good 2x equivalent.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.860]   And then the Citi Premier is also surprisingly good as a workhorse because it earns 3x on
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.860]   so many categories.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.420]   Gas is a big one that a lot of other banks just don't focus on or they know that it's
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.620]   going to be a money loser, so they just don't really focus on it at all.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.340]   And the fact that Citi Premier earns a 3x on it and it's uncapped is pretty good.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.740]   For any cards we talk about, if you go to all the hacks.com/cards, you can find the
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.140]   links for all the cards we're talking about except Citi.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.820]   We don't have any partners there, but you do.
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.740]   So if anyone here wants to get any of the cards that we're talking about, obviously
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.940]   support me, but also if it's a Citi card, I'll send them your way.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.940]   Askseby.com.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.940]   Again, Askseby.com.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.940]   A-S-K-S-E-B-Y.com.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.620]   We'll put the link to that in the show notes.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.100]   I wish I could say I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the reality is that I'm
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.100]   not.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.960]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why I always
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.300]   kickstart my day with AG1 and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:13.020]   AG1 has been in my routine for over a year because just one daily serving gives me the
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:18.380]   comprehensive foundational nutrition I need and supports energy, focus, strength and clarity
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:23.240]   with 75 high quality vitamins, probiotics and whole food sourced ingredients.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.020]   So it can completely replace your multivitamin, probiotics and more.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:31.180]   Every morning I mix it up with some water, add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.140]   and I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day, which is a feeling
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.820]   I absolutely love.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.420]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard for quality in the supplement category with
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.900]   less than one gram of sugar, no GMOs, no nasty chemicals or artificial anything.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.420]   So if you're looking for a simpler, effective investment in your health, try AG1 and get
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:57.780]   five free AG1 travel packs and a free one year supply of vitamin D with your first purchase.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.460]   Go to allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:08.580]   That's allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.500]   Even if you're responsible with money and always spend less than you make, having a
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.900]   grasp of your cashflow has so many benefits.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.860]   From spotting expenses that you definitely need to cut, to being able to better forecast
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.060]   your net worth, or even just being able to ask yourself whether you're really aligning
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.140]   the way you spend your money with your own priorities.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.620]   This has always been so hard for me until I started using Copilot, which is one of my
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.100]   all time favorite apps and I am so excited to finally be partnering with them after being
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.620]   such a huge fan.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.500]   Copilot makes it seamless and easy to track your spending and ultimately boost your savings.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.980]   I've tried dozens of apps that do this and Copilot is the only one I've kept using.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.780]   You can link accounts at over 10,000 institutions and their automatic expense categorization
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:57.180]   is the best I've used with custom Amazon and Venmo integrations to make it even better.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.380]   You can completely design your spending categories and easily set up rules to auto-assign transactions
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.620]   to them in the future.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.100]   Thanks to Copilot, I've never had a better grasp on my spending and cashflow, which by
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.740]   the way also means I can leave less money in our checking account and more somewhere
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.220]   else where it earns a lot more interest.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:20.740]   So for the best app to track your spending, subscription, and investments, go to allthehacks.com/copilot
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:26.500]   to download Copilot and use code HACKS2 during onboarding for a two-month free trial.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.500]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/copilot and the code HACKS2 for a free two-month trial
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.580]   of my favorite personal finance app.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.580]   And what do you think is coming?
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.580]   Venturex was a big thing.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.500]   I think we have two of them in our house.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.900]   Venturex business, I'm torn on.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.820]   It's a massive signup bonus, I think it's 150,000, but you have to spend 30 grand in
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.820]   three months.
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.380]   But I already have the Spark Cash Plus.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.740]   Pretty much equivalent, but I would argue that the annual fee there is a bit higher
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.220]   because you don't have that many credits offsetting it.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.740]   There's one, if you spend 100k or 150k, you get 100 back or something, or 150 back.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.180]   I don't know if I put that much on it.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.580]   But basically there's nothing to help you offset it while the Venturex business has
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.740]   the same $300 and 10,000 points.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.260]   So for me, that's already like, okay, that covers annual fee more or less, or you get
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   $5 in value.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.580]   So that's cheaper on a net basis.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.020]   And then you also have a priority pass card that works for restaurants.
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:20.060]   So if you don't want to run Chase Sapphire Preserve or JP Morgan Reserve, then that's
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.060]   an option.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.660]   And does the Venturex not?
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.940]   The Venturex one works for only lounges.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.940]   But the business is restaurants?
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.700]   The business as a filming works for restaurants as well.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.700]   Oh, interesting.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700]   I didn't know that.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.940]   And then I think one of the other big changes was Amex pulling back on Delta lounges.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.460]   And was it this year where they also cut back on guest policies?
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460]   Yes.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.700]   I think that would be another big change.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.060]   So I think for them, they're just trying to figure out how to make the lounge experience
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.820]   better because if you have to wait 30 minutes to one hour to go into the lounge, then it's
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.380]   a lose-lose for them because people start canceling cards, people post on social media
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.620]   that the line sucks and that this is terrible.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.860]   So how do you make it accessible to people, but also make it a good experience?
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.860]   They've toyed around with increasing the annual fee.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.940]   And I think that is something that we're probably bound to see in 2025.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.380]   But then the platinum has done so well in the last two years because people have started
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.660]   doing the math and realized that it makes sense.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.940]   The platinum numbers have doubled in the last four or five years, which is a lot of people.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.060]   And then the lounges have not kept up to that.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.820]   And then also a lot more people are traveling now.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.100]   There's also younger people who might be getting it because of the perks or the flex on people
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.100]   and stuff.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.960]   So it's just a lot of people have the cards and the lounge side has not kept up.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.900]   So aside from lounge changes, what do you think happens with cards next year, any year
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.220]   from now when we're catching up?
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.420]   What is going to be the Venture X thing we talked about?
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:40.180]   I think a lot of people don't like high annual fees for exchange of credits, but I think
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.180]   that's the most logical move for issuers and everyone.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.220]   It feels like the most win.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.540]   What I mean by that is, let's say you have a card that has an 850 annual fee, but you
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.220]   have like 1200 in credits.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.660]   So some people hate that because they're like, well, I can't use all these credits because
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.100]   we're conditioned to want to maximize everything.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.780]   But the goal is necessarily to use every single credit to get enough value that you maybe
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.100]   break even for the credit card.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.540]   So all the other perks and the multipliers of the card end up just being value on top
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.100]   positive expected value from it.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.880]   So I think we're going to see more of that.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.380]   Probably Citi's going to push that, but I think that's the most logical move because
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.580]   issuers make money, they probably have a bit more room to give you better multipliers too.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.380]   And then for the people that would benefit from those credits, it's also a win because
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.180]   you might come out ahead for the platinum card.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.820]   If you live in certain cities, if you don't use certain products, you might actually be
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.140]   losing money or you might be paying that two or three hundred dollars in order to get the
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.020]   card for lounge access and other perks.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.540]   But there are people that live in New York and the Bay Area who already pay for Equinox
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.540]   where they come out ahead.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.620]   They're like, wait, I use all of these services.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.620]   I use Uber.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.620]   I use Equinox.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.820]   I swap at Saks enough that I can use the credit.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.540]   I think we're going to see more of that, which might end up pissing some people off, but
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.940]   it's probably a net positive move.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.060]   I wish I used Equinox so that I could get the value.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.340]   I'm pretty confident that just starting to use Equinox is going to not be a net savings.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.100]   So one tactic you can actually do is if you have a friend that uses Equinox, you could
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.220]   just let them swap your card in for a month and they'll use up the credit and then they
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.660]   can just treat you to dinner or something.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.020]   That's what kind of I'm doing right now.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.360]   I have a lot of platinum cards and then I'm just like, hey, I'm free.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.520]   You pay for Equinox already anyways.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.340]   I have these eight platinum cards.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.220]   You want to swap them in every single month, they use up the credit and then you can pay
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.220]   for sushi.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.980]   I'm just going to stand outside of the Equinox in the Bay Area.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.980]   So it's a portal every month.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.980]   So it's easier.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.820]   And I feel like there's bound to be a lot of tech people, you know, that have it, but
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.380]   it's just a weird conversation.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.780]   Probably not worth the brain cells if I only have one.
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.740]   So if I had eight, maybe it would be worth finding that person.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.020]   What do you think happens on the earning side?
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.220]   I know there was a big scare, I guess, when we thought this legislation was going to pass
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.220]   and cause all these challenges.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.400]   It looks like it's not.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.100]   Do you think credit card companies in the next year, do you think that comes back?
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.300]   Do you think we'd see legislation to try to limit the interchange that card companies
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.300]   can make?
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.220]   I think people are still going to try to push for it, whether it goes through or not.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.220]   It's the big question.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   If it does go through, I think it actually kind of destroys their credit card space in
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.220]   a lot of ways.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.940]   I think in the short term, we will see issuers just keep doing the same thing and maybe increasing
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.940]   the multipliers.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.260]   It's really hard to do the opposite.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.780]   If someone told you we're going from 4X to 3X, that's going to piss off so many people
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.760]   and get so much churn from it that you're probably better off keeping the numbers and
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.660]   then trying to make money back somewhere else, whether that's decreasing perks or increasing
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.660]   annual fees.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.020]   Because I think people are used to that cycle of upgrades.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.140]   And then you can always argue inflation like, "Hey, technically 250 two years ago is now
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.500]   like 350 or 300."
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.700]   I think one of the hardest parts for cards is all the transfer ratios for the most part
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.700]   are all one-to-one and seem so simple to keep it one-to-one that they can't really pull
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.700]   that lever easily.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.700]   So they can pull perks.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.540]   Do you think we'll ever see cards where it's like here are four perks, you get to pick
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.540]   two of them?
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.780]   I kind of wish Citi would do that or any other issuer.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.140]   I think that's an interesting play and gamifies it a lot more.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:44.140]   But I'm not sure if the normal card user that's not a super user would like that because it
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.140]   might sound too confusing.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.140]   But I think it's cool.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.060]   I think right now you probably have at least eight priority pass memberships and you don't
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.060]   need them.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.060]   No, not at all.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.300]   I could use even a $50 credit or something per year.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.300]   That would be nice.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.620]   Or maybe a $50 credit for something else, Barry's Bootcamp or something.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.980]   So I think that would be cool.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.460]   It just brings up a different conversation now.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:07.100]   Because for the Platinum, the whole draw is that, "Oh, I can get $1,400 in value.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.780]   I might not, but I can."
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.980]   So there's that potential of getting outsized value.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.220]   And they love to market that.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.220]   Yes.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.540]   Even for my calculations and stuff, I'm like, "You need to knock it down for your own case."
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.660]   We have calculators on AskSebi.com for this.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.340]   I think the moment you're like, "Okay, cool.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.140]   That's a 900 annual fee, but you have 800 credits, but you have to pick the ones."
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.180]   It ends up not being the best for the company or for people that are signing up.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.180]   It's only good for us.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.140]   And I'm pretty sure they're not optimizing for us.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.140]   Yes.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.780]   So do credit card companies like power users because they tell their friends and their
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.780]   friends aren't?
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.100]   Or do they secretly wish that they could put a red flag on all of our accounts and close
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   us all down?
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.220]   I think we represent such a small number that they probably don't care.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.420]   I think it's reminiscent of the casinos where there's people that count cards, right?
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.940]   You actually want people to think that they can go in and count cards and movies like
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:53.940]   that to propagate.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.660]   The average person, even if they mentally can do it, they're not going to spend the
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.780]   time to learn how to do it or they'll think about how to do the process.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.060]   So by having this whole thing like, "Oh, you can get money, but maybe they don't do enough
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.860]   research," then they end up losing.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.500]   But the people that watch videos and read blogs are probably already a lot ahead of
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   everyone else.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.740]   We talked about how you have eight platinum cards, which is a little crazy.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.820]   And I think one of the things that people often miss about the game is we get so caught
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.860]   up in, "Well, which card is going to give me the most number of points for how I spend
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.860]   my money?"
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.300]   And don't get me wrong, I've created a tool where people can actually go in and put their
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.540]   spend in and figure out the right optimal use of cards because at the end of the day,
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.060]   no one wants to leave points on the table.
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.900]   However, when I think about it and I just start doing the math, even with the best card,
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.220]   if you could have a 5X points on everything card and your return was 5X, welcome bonuses
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.700]   seem to be better than that almost always.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.620]   Is there an argument that all you should be ever chasing is welcome bonuses and you should
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.580]   not be focused on any multipliers and bonuses?
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.460]   So I think it's interesting where a lot of people who spend less money focus more on
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.660]   multipliers when they should be focusing on intro bonuses because that drives more money.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.860]   If you're spending only $500 a month, getting $200 back for that $500 just makes a lot more
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.060]   sense and you can actually repeat that so many times because there's so many cards.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.740]   5% on $500 is not material at all.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.180]   So ironically, the people that should be focused on multipliers are the high spenders, the
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.140]   ones that are spending $5,000 or $10,000 a month eating out.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.100]   I think some people look at that and be like, "That's absurd.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.100]   Who does that?"
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.340]   But there are people that spend a ton of money.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.300]   For those people, the multipliers start to matter a lot more because that's already 25,000
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.420]   points in one month, potentially, depending on the card.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.180]   So for most people, especially when you're starting out, focus on intro bonuses.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.180]   That drives the needle.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.420]   That's like 20% return on spend to 40% depending on the card.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.700]   But I think once you ramp up, once you have a business, at some point, just run out of
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.700]   bonuses.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.580]   If you have a business that runs a lot of Facebook ads and you're spending $200K a month,
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.600]   there's not enough intro bonuses for you to go for.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.640]   So you do start to focus on multipliers or maybe getting hotel status or airline status
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.820]   with that spend.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.740]   But if you're someone who has dabbled, you've opened two or three cards, and maybe you're
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.300]   spending, I don't know, five, seven grand a month.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.420]   So you're kind of on that high end, but you haven't opened up a ton of cards.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.260]   Even if you're a high spender, if you've only opened up a few cards in your time, it probably
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.540]   makes sense to focus on intro bonuses.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.540]   I think so.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.880]   I think you can argue that one a lot more because you're in that weird mid spot.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.340]   But for me, intro bonuses, especially travel ones, just drive so much value.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.540]   Would you rather spend maybe three or four months of spending to get the same bonus or
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.540]   maybe one month?
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.960]   And especially if you are trying to time towards a honeymoon or any other big endeavor where
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.020]   you need a lot of points, it just makes more sense.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:26.440]   So to me, I think intro bonuses are the focus, especially when you're young and you have
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.660]   time to manage stuff anyways.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.860]   If you have kids, then obviously maybe that's not worth your time.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.000]   I would push back and say, if you're going to spend the time to figure out what card
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.420]   earns the most points, you'd probably be better off just getting another card unless you've
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.700]   played the game so heavily that you're out of cards, which you probably are.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.620]   So my view is you should probably work your way to like 10, 20, or like 50 cards.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.400]   But obviously, that's not everyone and I want to be cognizant that like some people do have
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   like lives.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.920]   I like researching stuff.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.760]   On a Friday night, I think we'll watch Netflix, hang out, have dinner.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.840]   But then at night, I'm randomly researching stuff and going down rabbit holes.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.120]   Sometimes it's not credit card related.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   Sometimes it's like travel.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.240]   Sometimes it's something completely different, like mechanical keyboards.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.640]   I like researching stuff.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.640]   I enjoy learning.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.360]   But I know some people who are like, "No, I'd rather be spending more time with my kids
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.360]   or partying or clubbing or whatever else."
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.920]   So I think it just depends on you.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.560]   So you just said potentially 50.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.700]   Let's pretend someone listening is like, "Whoa, I was doing this game wrong."
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.940]   So one, I've noticed from people that have published, "Here's me opening up a high velocity
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.620]   of cards over a short period of time."
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.700]   The impact on your credit is surprisingly positive.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.060]   So I think that was a misconception a lot of people have is, "Oh, if I opened up five,
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.940]   six, seven, eight cards in a year, it would destroy my credit."
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.060]   I'm pretty sure my experience from people that have reported it and from the few times
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.660]   where I did that is that the exact opposite is true.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.660]   Is that what you've seen?
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.660]   For the most part, yes.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.420]   I think short term, you might see a dip.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.660]   And then especially if you're a student, you'll see a bigger dip, and I think that's when
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.660]   they get spooked by it.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.420]   But I think especially if you're in the 25 to 30, and especially later on range, where
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.280]   you already have these older cards anyways to be your anchor and your foundation, the
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   impact is so minimal.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.380]   And unless you're shopping for a mortgage or something like that, it doesn't really
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.380]   matter.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.460]   "Oh no, my credit score dropped from 800 to 750."
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.140]   And a 50 point drop like that would not be one card.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.700]   That would be over a series?
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.300]   That'd probably be over a series unless you had a very thin file, like if you only had
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.060]   like one card, and then this is your second card, then yeah, you might see a 50 point
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.060]   drop.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.140]   And so how would you think about that sequence?
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.260]   If you were someone that's like, "Okay, let's get a card a quarter this year."
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.220]   I think earlier you referenced Capital One might be early.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.580]   Is there a high level version of how you would think about where to start?
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.500]   I generally think of it as stages.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:32.940]   So Chase being the first off set of stuff because of Chase 524 and how they limit cards.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.220]   And then also their business cards are pretty lucrative and you can get a lot of them while
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.600]   you're under 524.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.180]   And we've talked about this at length just for anyone who's new to 524.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.360]   When Chase looks to approve you for a card, and it's not a published rule, but everyone
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.420]   has seen it work.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.140]   If you open more than five cards in the last 24 months across all issuers on your personal
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.620]   report, they're going to stop you.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.020]   So if you've opened five and you try to open a business card, they're going to say no.
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.740]   But if you open a business card, it doesn't show up on your personal report on Chase.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.980]   And so you could open up five business cards and then open up a personal card and be okay
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.980]   because the business card is not going to show up from Chase.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.340]   It will from Capital One.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.340]   Yes.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.460]   And some other issuers, but most issuers don't.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.460]   And then once you're at 424, you go down the ink list, especially if you have an EIN and
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.060]   different options there.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.700]   You can technically get a lot of ink bonuses from each of your businesses.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.980]   You have a whole business channel on YouTube that I bet people can go deep down a rabbit
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.980]   hole.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.980]   Ask Subby Business.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.940]   And so I think a lot of people would be surprised that they probably do something in their life
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.700]   that would qualify them for a business card, even if they're not running a business with
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.700]   employees.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.980]   So that's definitely something to look at.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.240]   So Chase is kind of where you start because of their kind of application rules.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.460]   So application rules and also number of intro bonuses and then the value of intro bonuses.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.980]   And then the fact that a lot of their cards have downgrade paths and a no annual fee options.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.340]   And also a lot of the ones that don't are just keeper cards.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.700]   So ones where you get value every year by keeping it hotel cards being one of the best
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.840]   examples of this.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.440]   After that, I would do Capital One mostly because they can be pretty hard to get approved
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.260]   for if you have very high velocity and you have a lot of cards.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.380]   So there are people out there who have an 800 credit score who make two 300 K, but who
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.580]   will not get approved for the Venture X because Capital One knows that you're not profitable.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.420]   So you generally want to get your foot in that door early on.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.620]   Saver One, Venture X are all pretty good cards for that.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.620]   They also just make sense.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.140]   They're good cards by themselves.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.580]   If you hadn't opened a lot of Chase cards and you're sitting at 024 or 124, would you
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.020]   make a case to maybe start with a big bonus on a Venture X upfront?
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:31.080]   That's one of the few issuers I would consider burning a 524 slot for, but I'd probably still
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.740]   go through Chase personally, but depends on you.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.100]   And is it as simple as Chase 524?
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.860]   If I'm at 124, can I just go open up four cards in the next 90 days?
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.020]   You generally want to get a new card, I would say every one to three months and then for
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.620]   business cards every two to three months.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.380]   So you kind of want to have it out based off what you're trying to do.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.260]   IXG Premier, World of Hyatt are all pretty good cards.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.300]   Boundless is interesting, especially if you want to in the future upgrade to the Ritz
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.420]   card, which is another rabbit hole.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.700]   United cards are good for the bonuses and downgrade paths and perks if you want free
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   check to bags.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.100]   Aeroplanes just a really good bonus, but doesn't have a downgrade path.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.220]   But yeah, there's like a lot of cards you can get that just provide a lot of value.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.980]   I think Chase is probably the issuer with the most six figure bonuses.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:10.980]   It's always Chase.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.660]   And then if you look at bonuses across the board, who really has a lot of bonuses, it's
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.520]   American Express and Chase.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.380]   That's why you want to focus on Chase early on because you want to get those bonuses.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.820]   And then a lot of the bonuses are also on a 24 month clock, where if you don't currently
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.940]   have the card and you haven't got the bonus in 24 months, you would actually be eligible
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.940]   for that bonus again.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.720]   So a lot of people start off Chase, go through everything else, and then you can circle back
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.720]   to Chase.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.460]   One thing that I think you'll find if you get to your fourth or fifth Chase card is
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.420]   you might get denied right away.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.060]   And you can often, at least in my experience, call up and the denial isn't that they don't
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.060]   want to give you the card.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.580]   It's they just don't want to give you any more credit.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.780]   And you could say, "Oh, well, can you move some credit over from this other card I have
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.820]   that has a $25,000 limit?"
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.580]   You just put 10 there and bring 15 over.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.220]   So Chase generally wants to give you about 50% of your income as your total credit limit
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.220]   for them.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.220]   That's what they're willing to risk.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.420]   So if you make 100, then among all your Chase cards, total limit should be around 50K.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.400]   So you can also carve room, which is what I call it, where you intentionally decrease
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.740]   credit limits to just make it easier to get approved.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.720]   So like, let's say if you have a 200K salary, you know that your cap is 100K.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.380]   If you already have 100K and you're not using all your credit limit anyways, why not just
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.740]   decrease one of these cards by 5K?
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.740]   Can you do that?
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.180]   Can you just ask them for a credit decrease?
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.180]   Yes, you can.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.700]   And then that makes it easier to get approved.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.540]   Obviously, some people will be like, "I'd rather call in.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.700]   I don't owe getting credit limit decreases are dumb.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.700]   Why would anyone do that?"
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.540]   As someone who doesn't like calling in and waiting on the phone and stuff, I'd rather
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.500]   just send a message saying, "Decrease my credit limit by 5K."
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.660]   That's immaterial to me.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.900]   And if it makes the approval process easier, then that's a win.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.820]   Do you think there's an argument of that actually working more often?
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.060]   My rationale is that it's lower risk.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.580]   Because I think anytime you have more eyes on your account, it's a negative thing.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.540]   So I don't want to have to call in and then ask them to move limits around and then have
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.300]   someone be like, "Why does this guy have 12 Chase cards?"
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.600]   Maybe that's another risk flag.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.620]   By me decreasing the limit, then it's the algorithm approving me.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.140]   And to me, that's just lower risk.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.060]   So you go Chase to Amex, I'm guessing?
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.060]   No.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.060]   So you do Chase to Capital One.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.060]   Capital One.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.460]   And then I would say Citi, Bank of America, Barclays are all kind of in the same zone.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.180]   After Capital One, you can make the argument for U.S. Bank.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.540]   And there's not that many cards unless you're in cashback, basically.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.180]   And all the ones you mentioned, Bank of America, Barclays, U.S. Bank, are they all cashback?
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:25.060]   Bank of America would be for Alaska points because that is super valuable and they have
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.780]   a lot of first business class options with their partners.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.460]   We flew Alaska a lot for a few years.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.980]   We had some status and I collected all these Alaska points and I never want to spend them
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.300]   because I feel like they're the one currency.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.960]   There's just no way to get more Alaska points that I know of.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.420]   Maybe Bonvoy transfer.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.900]   It's not really a good transfer though, right?
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.520]   It's pretty bad value to transfer.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.180]   There is a case for Bank of America if you're on Team Cashback, if you want to have 100K
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.340]   with their brokerage, with Merrill or something.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.660]   Let's come back to cashback.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.100]   And any nuance with Amex?
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:56.380]   You generally want to start with the platinum card to like how they use the platinum offers
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.620]   to entice people to come in.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.880]   So generally speaking, if you're not a customer of them, you can get the most value generally
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.420]   like 125, the 150K as an intro bonus.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.680]   And like they dangle that carrot because when you're not a customer, they want to bring
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   you in.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.260]   But then the moment you become a customer, it becomes a lot harder to get that offer.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.820]   You can still pull it up by using something like CardMatch.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.140]   We have a whole blog post on assets that I'll be walking through CardMatch.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.660]   But I think a lot of people just don't realize they see the gold card and they're like that
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.980]   card makes a lot of sense for me.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:27.180]   And then you get that card and then you potentially lose out on 75K to like 25K in MRF Platinum
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.420]   bonus from the platinum that you otherwise could have gotten.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.900]   I just got an email today that 150K on platinum through CardMatch is a very open option.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.700]   Like sometimes it's you're lucky if you get it.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.260]   Right now, it seems pretty pervasive for new customers.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:43.060]   So I'll find a link to CardMatch for the 150K and I'll put in the show notes.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.660]   If you're not a customer with them, that's generally the easiest way to get the 150K.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.100]   If you are a customer, you still can get the 150K, but it's just a lot less common.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.380]   And sometimes you have to literally wait for the flyers to come in the mail, like physical
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.380]   paper.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.940]   And after, how do you think about the strategy of going through Amex membership rewards cards
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.480]   or MR as you've been saying, or all their airline hotel cards?
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.260]   I would do the other cards first just because they have so many other rules around it.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.100]   So there's something called the 456 rule.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.020]   So for their credit cards, you can only have four or five or six of them.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:18.340]   Their MR cards don't have that rule, so you can actually get as many of them as you want
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   at any time.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.260]   So you generally want to start with the credit cards first, because that just makes more
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.780]   sense to start those clocks, because that's going to be your bottleneck.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:30.380]   And that's all the Marriott, Hilton, and I mean, there's other cards, there's like a
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.380]   Lowe's card.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.460]   I haven't gotten that one because that doesn't matter to me.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.180]   Would it be there on your quest to 50?
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.300]   Is there an intro bonus?
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.100]   There is an intro bonus, but I don't think it matters for me because I don't shop there.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.100]   What's after that?
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.100]   That's it, right?
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.700]   You either get a lease or you get into the business game, but I feel like that's it.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.860]   As a parent, you've had to learn so many new skills to provide for your family, how to
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:56.740]   do copious amounts of laundry, meal plan for even the pickiest eater, and now how to protect
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.420]   your family's financial future.

[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   the best?
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.480]   Like when I wanted to level up my barbecue game?
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.960]   Well, for that, I took Aaron Franklin's Texas-style barbecue class on Masterclass,
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   which was amazing.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.640]   I've learned so much from the classes I've taken on Masterclass, and I'm excited to
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.600]   partner with them for this episode.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.480]   With Masterclass, you can learn from the world's best minds, anytime, anywhere, and at your

[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.600]   And with every class I've taken, I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge the instructors
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.040]   have and the quality of the experience.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.160]   I highly recommend you check it out.

[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.440]   We didn't talk about built at all because as great as I think built points are, there's
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.520]   no welcome bonus.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.720]   There's a secret welcome bonus that exists, technically, if you sign up.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.680]   And then oftentimes, in the first five days, they'll let you earn up to 50k points.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.360]   You get 5x points.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.440]   And first they announce that it's official, and then they announce that it's random and
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.440]   it's not official.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.440]   So I don't want to promise it.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.980]   But if you want a card to earn 3x points on dining, great.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.400]   But if you pay rent, it makes sense.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.880]   I would still put it on the back burner after American Express, though, or maybe at the
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.680]   same time as American Express.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.640]   The rationale being that the multiplier sounds nice on the surface, but if you're someone
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.440]   that's a low spender, you're better off using that rent to help hit intro bonuses.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.780]   If you're someone who doesn't spend that much on everything else, but you're paying New
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:16.400]   York or Bay Area or anywhere rent, that 500 or 1,000 or 2,000 in spend, you can earn 1x.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.320]   That sounds great, but you're better off just literally hitting a full on intro bonus and
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.400]   paying like maybe 2% fees, if that makes sense.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.880]   So you're arguing that because the intro bonus is so big, let's use a practical example.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.120]   Let's say you live in New York, your rent is 4k.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.520]   You could easily use that 4k to hit the CSP intro bonus of 60k points.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.920]   If you put it on the bills, you're getting 4,000 points.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.600]   So you're looking at 60,000 points versus 4,000 points.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.000]   And the fact that most intro bonuses are repeatable, you're going down the intro bonus list.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.640]   And going for an intro bonus each month, even if you have to pay $80 in fees, on one card,
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.760]   you're paying 4,000, you're getting a 60,000 point bonus and spending $80 in fees.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.340]   And on the other, you're spending 4,000, you're getting 4,000 points, but no fees.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.960]   Because the net amount is positive.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.360]   Even if you use enough credits to offset the fees you're paying, it just makes financial
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.360]   sense.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   The math works out.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.360]   Have you done the math?
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.000]   What is an average percent back in points for intro bonuses?
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.280]   I'd say for cashback equivalent, probably about 20% to 30%.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.480]   For travel stuff, 30% to 80%.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.200]   Southwest ones, we've seen some pretty crazy offers there because they also have just lower
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.960]   minimum spends oftentimes.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.320]   Business tends to be about 11.1%, give or take.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.580]   So when you say 2025, you mean it's kind of like if your Amex gold card earns four points
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.720]   per dollar on groceries, for the amount of money you spend on the intro bonus, you're
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.260]   earning effectively 25 points per dollar?
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.260]   You could say that.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.260]   I mean, it's different per card.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.880]   And if you spend money past the intro bonus, it's not the same.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.680]   The argument, so for dining, it still makes sense that intro bonuses are better, but that's
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   still 4x.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.840]   With built, you're only looking at 1x.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.040]   That is a pretty big difference to me.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   I think that makes sense.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.040]   That was a lot.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.240]   I think people have probably been convinced at least to look into the intro bonus game
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.000]   a little bit more if they haven't.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   What's the cap?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   How many cards are you at?
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   North of 50.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   No problems.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.560]   When you were in that home stretch doing the last 40 to 50, you were still getting approvals.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.360]   That's why American Express was towards Dan.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.960]   I think if you actually map out things properly, you can easily do that.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.480]   It's not a problem in terms of managing.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.360]   I think some people will be like, oh, that's a lot of work.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.840]   You can automate a lot of it using either code or just building your own stuff.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.520]   Or even if you want to keep it very manual, you can set a lot of the dates around the
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   same time.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.880]   So for example, all my chase cards close on the first of each month or as close as I could
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.480]   make it to the end of the month because everything just closes there.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.680]   And then all my Amex cards close mid month.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   And why does that matter?
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.880]   Mostly just to make your life simpler.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.040]   If someone's like 50 cards, how do I deal with paying these off?
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.120]   But you're not using all 50 regularly.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   I'm not using all 50.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.520]   But I'm saying just mentally, if it's weird for you to be like, I don't want to look at
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.780]   my cards every single day of a month, potentially for some weird fraud charge or something.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.160]   It's just easier to maybe set like one or two dates in a month as dates that you even
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.160]   look at stuff.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   But you don't need to use most of the cards.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.680]   I just link all my cards.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.860]   I use Copilot, but you can use any other tool, link all your cards, you'll see all the transactions
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.860]   come up.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.640]   I don't think I've reviewed my transactions on the card issuer sites for a while.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.360]   So I think that also works if you have an aggregator.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.640]   But yeah, for the most part, I think it's a lot less stressful than you think it is.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   I think if you're coming from zero cards or like three cards to 50, that sounds very intense.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.440]   But if you're someone who's already at 8 to 10, you're used to it at this point.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.440]   It's like going to the gym.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.960]   And so 50 cards, that's easily, I've got to assume at least 75,000 points per bonus.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.320]   Overtake Yeah, to be fair, a lot of the bonuses were easier to get back in the day as well.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.360]   Bank of America was substantially more lax with their intro bonuses and like how many
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.600]   cards you could get any other things to keep in mind, especially on Amex when it comes
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.680]   to how many times you can get a bonus.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.280]   So it's technically once in a lifetime, I think there are some form inkling saying that
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.560]   maybe it's once every 10 years, but I just don't want to rely on an exception.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:45.280]   For most people, I would lean towards American Express towards the end, unless you know that
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.520]   you don't want to get that many cards because not everyone does, or you're just a very high
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.520]   spender.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.560]   Like if you're a food reviewer in New York and you spend 10k a month, then yeah, the
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.400]   gold card probably works out for you.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.240]   And so we said we would talk about cashback briefly.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.200]   If someone's thinking, this is great, I want to earn a lot of value, I want to open cards.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.360]   But when it comes to using my points, I just find that I don't get the value I want.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.800]   And if you're ending up using your points to just book in the travel portal on Amex
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:15.320]   or Citi, is it even worth playing the points game or is it worth considering cashback cards?
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.560]   You still can go for intro bonuses, because it's the same math that drives the needle
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   the most.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.660]   Setup wise, you might be looking at different cards.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.160]   So I think Chase still kind of works pretty well for cashback.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.760]   Bank of America is another consideration now because they have like these really good cards
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.720]   that you like earn up to 5.25% on a lot of transactions and 2.26, I think.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   2.625.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.080]   Yeah, 2.625 on everything else.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.520]   So there's always a play for that, especially if you just want something super simple.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.120]   Amex, I think a lot of people get pissed off because they're like, wait, I only get 0.6
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.160]   cents in value for my points.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   And that's not very good.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.520]   You can get the Schwab card in order to get like 1.1 cents.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.520]   So that's a bit better.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.520]   And that's the Schwab Platinum.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.520]   The Schwab Platinum.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.360]   But then at the same time, you're like, well, if you're someone that's focused on cashback,
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.760]   you tend not to travel, in which case the Platinum card becomes a lot harder to recommend
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   and use.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.840]   So that's a bigger dilemma where you're like, technically, a Platinum card might make financial
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.760]   sense because I spend so much and that increases my earn rate, but I don't travel.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.960]   So this card is not useful other than for that earn rate bonus.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.480]   If you want to earn points and you want to use them without having to go to the hassle
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.880]   of transferring, Chase is probably going to be best.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.880]   Cap One, Citi, and then Amex.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.000]   I think it's really tough because you only get 0.5 cents per point unless you use like
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   the saver.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.160]   But the Venture X kind of becomes like out of the equation.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.160]   Even if you're booking in their portal?
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   If you're doing some form of travel, then yeah, so you have 1 cent, sorry.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.640]   But if you're like purely cashback, then I would say Capital One other than the saver
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.560]   or saver one would not be on my list.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.840]   Citi's also not bad.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.360]   Portal's still only 1 cent, but you could also cash out at 1 cent per point, which is
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.360]   pretty nice.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   Okay.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   So Citi's pretty good if you want credits out.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   And then we talked about rent, right?
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.920]   One way that you could hit these intro bonuses, because some of them spend a few thousand
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   dollars.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.600]   If you don't have that spend, do a lot of them, even run some in tandem.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.760]   You could just pay fees.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:02.600]   Are there other good ways to increase your spend to hit these bonuses without necessarily
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   adding to your expenses for the year?
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.480]   I think you can speak to this pretty well.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.520]   If you're the group trip planner, that works out very well, especially if you have more
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.720]   wealthy friends for a bachelor party or something.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.680]   If everyone's paying you a ton of money, and then you're booking all the hotels, meals
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   are obviously another one.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:21.240]   I think a lot of people also end up starting businesses as a means of earning more points.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.960]   And then eventually, ironically, that ends up becoming like a profit center and say,
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.200]   oh, I can make a lot of money here.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.240]   So I've seen people flip things or drop shipping style stuff where you can get a lot of points
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.240]   and also get money.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.040]   So I've run into people who are like, yeah, I run 100K in ads, make a crap ton of money.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.840]   But I started this because I was trying to figure out how to get more points.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:43.020]   I met someone recently who I think he said spends $4 million a month for his business
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.040]   on I can't remember which Amex it was.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.160]   I would be so sad if it was like a platinum card because he could just be earning twice
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.160]   as much.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.320]   But at that point, I'm like, if you're earning $4 million, I was going to guess the business
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.960]   goal for ads, but then I was like, oh, $4 million is a lot.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960]   That's a lot.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.200]   I guess Amex might be the only card that would give you a limit to do that.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.960]   Number one, VentureX business is also like a charge card where it's uncapped and 2x back
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.960]   on everything.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   That's what this person should have.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.960]   That's why I think it's like the best new card right now or like the best business card
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   arguably.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   Same with the Spark Cash Plus.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.160]   Spark Cash Plus had the best intro bonus when I got it.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.720]   It was $250,000.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.440]   It's just the fact that it's uncapped because Amex, unless you're doing like 5K plus purchases,
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.000]   then you get 1.5x on the platinum business.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   But everything else is capped off, like the blue business plus, that's only 50K.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.240]   You're going to burn through that.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.720]   If you're a high spender, Amex doesn't have a great everything card.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.720]   Surprisingly.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.720]   So we talked a lot about earning points.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.120]   We talked a lot about what's coming.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.480]   Let's talk a little bit about how we use them.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:36.240]   I think the two of us have gotten a chance to do a lot of exciting international, maybe
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.560]   some domestic aspirational trips.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.560]   If people are sitting on points and thinking, what are some amazing ways to use them?
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.560]   What are some of your favorites and your highlights?
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.200]   Whether it's airline cabins, destinations, or specific properties.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.440]   If you have a player two, you should probably ask them where they want to go.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.960]   That's a good starting point because for a lot of people, that's how they actually convert
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.080]   their partner to get into credit cards because they're like, why are you focused on these
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   points?
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080]   This sounds dumb.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.360]   But when you take them to the place they want to go, they're like, oh, this is really nice.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.360]   Wow.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.600]   Why were we flying economy before when we can fly business?
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.200]   I lean more towards hotel still in terms of value, because I think you get so much more
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.200]   time there.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.880]   And also you can have two people.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.160]   Flights are fun, but they feel so much more finite.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.040]   I think Bora Bora Maldives are obviously the go to ones.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.960]   And I think some people argue it's a bit overrated as someone that likes to snorkel and enjoy
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   the water.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   I really like it.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.680]   And I think the fact that I can check it off the bucket list is fun as well.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.800]   No Seychelles yet.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.620]   That's on the list for twenty twenty four.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.620]   The new Waldorf.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.240]   Oh, we did two Hilton's there.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.600]   I don't know if they're both still there.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.160]   I think we were looking to that initially.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.920]   And then when we heard that the water was opening in twenty twenty four, I was like,
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.420]   oh, OK, let's just do that instead.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.200]   Some of those aspirational stays have been great.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.540]   But even domestically, I feel like you've been done Ventana, which is one of the best
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:48.120]   values of high points out there, despite being a lot of hype.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.800]   I think that one's an interesting one.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   It's not for everyone.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.760]   Like I've heard you either love it or you hate it.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.080]   So I like it because it's a means for me to reconnect with environment and get away from
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.500]   everything as someone who's like constantly connected to technology.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.680]   I grew up camping and doing a lot of that stuff.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.600]   So it was the closest I could get to that while still keeping Mandy happy, because Mandy
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.100]   just does not like outdoors stuff for whatever reason.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.160]   She's also sitting there right now.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:14.960]   I think that was the closest she got to glamping, which is kind of funny and also sad.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.100]   I've been there for a wedding and we were too cheap to book a room at the wedding rate
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.440]   and there was nothing with points.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.920]   So we booked over like a room at a hotel down the street, and I have not been back yet.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.720]   It's probably worth at least like one weekend.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.680]   It's just a nice little escape that's nearby.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.240]   So we hit the most obvious spots.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.840]   Are there a few properties that aren't quite as wild as these honeymoon destinations that
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.760]   you think are interesting spots to check out around the world or even domestically?
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.320]   Not really a points one, but you can use points to get there booking through portals.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.280]   Faroe Islands is still our favorite vacation that like we pretty much paid out of pocket
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.280]   for.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.080]   It's one of the islands that is owned by Denmark, I believe.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.640]   That's between London, Iceland, and basically up there, it's like a tiny islands.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.800]   They have these puffins there.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.400]   Kind of what you imagine Iceland to be, but even nicer in a lot of ways.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.400]   Just super picturesque.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.800]   And last, what have been your top airline cabin experiences?
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.940]   If someone's like, I'm saving some points up and I just want to have a wild experience
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.200]   in the sky, where do you think your points can take you right now?
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.960]   Because I know getting Emirates first used to be a little bit more accessible, fees can
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:16.960]   get pretty high.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.400]   What do you think is the best bang?
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.240]   Best bang for buck would probably be ANA given just the ways you can book it and like the
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.880]   value of the cabin and also the fact that it's like one of the best first and also business
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   class.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.080]   If anything, it's the best business class cabin right now.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.560]   So I think that's where the value is.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:35.560]   I think in terms of crazy experience, I mean Etihad first, apartments are still nice.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.880]   I don't like their soft product, they were kind of mean, but it's fine.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.880]   But the hard product is nice.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   It's like very big.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.560]   And where can you get Etihad?
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   Americans probably the best way.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.280]   Or you can book through, I think their points, but it might not be that advantageous.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:51.360]   They used to have more routes, but then since the shutdowns and stuff, the routes only recently
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.360]   opened back up.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:57.000]   So I think London to Abu Dhabi or is it France to Abu Dhabi is the main one right now that
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   has the new cabin.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.320]   And second point is pretty hard to get.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.280]   Is your stash of American points just American cards?
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.440]   Or how did you build up an American balance enough to do that?
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.760]   It's mostly American cards and we don't have that many anymore.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.680]   So sometimes we actually even buy it if the math makes sense.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:14.400]   So they'll have promotions where they'll be like, we'll give you an extra 40% points.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.680]   So for us, I'm like, all right, cool.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.360]   So that means I can book first class for about $2,200.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.800]   I'm like, that still makes sense.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.000]   There is a stage where if you're comfortable, especially if you're reviewing stuff, there
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.960]   is a case of buying points because at a certain point you do run out of points.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.640]   I watched someone do the math on Wyndham points, Wyndham points using the book of Akasa.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.120]   You can get some good deals, but at times, and I think recently there was one of those
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.960]   times where you could book Wyndham points for less than a penny a point.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.040]   And so to transfer your points to Wyndham was actually a worse deal than to redeem them
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.920]   for statement credits and just buy the Wyndham points.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.280]   Same thing with IHG where like their points are terrible value-wise and like there's almost
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.200]   no use case where you're getting at least one cent per point.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.280]   So you're better off either just booking through the portal or just like cashing it out.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.720]   But that's also why I'm wanting to switch from Delta because I have a lot of business
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.200]   spend anyways, and I'm going towards status.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.720]   For my end result, do I want to have, let's say 200,000 Delta miles or do I want 200,000
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   American?
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.600]   An American has so much more value while I'm sitting on an astronomical amount of Delta
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.320]   miles because I haven't had a good use case.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.120]   I've been waiting for Delta flash sales to come back and they just did.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.160]   But other than that, I don't want to spend 400K for business class one-way flight.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.600]   So if someone's listening and they have half a million Delta points, how do you use Delta
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.080]   points to get good value?
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.480]   It's either Delta flash sales are kind of treating them like cash and like Southwest
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.400]   miles where you get fixed value.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.320]   And if you're fine, if that's great, like if you're cash back focused or like economy
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.000]   travel, it's not bad, but like if you're looking for outsized value, it's tough.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.680]   I remember we took our honeymoon to the Seychelles and it was 120,000 Delta points on Air France.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.080]   Partner awards on Delta.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.840]   Are there deals ever to be had?
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:47.040]   So there used to be a lot more and it was a lot easier back in the day of partner awards.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.720]   And it's not really the case anymore.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.480]   Delta flash sales is like the main thing that they discontinued for like three years during
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.880]   the shutdowns and it just brought back in August.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.220]   That's generally when they have either Delta or partner flights that just have a lot of
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.540]   availability that like people aren't flying.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.300]   So they end up having a sale for it and better value.
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:08.140]   I've been getting a lot of value from Delta points on just short domestic flights.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.140]   It's like fixed value.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.900]   But for that, you're getting like 1.3 to 1.5 like you're not getting crazy value.
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:19.740]   I found a few close to two cent values on Delta to Mexico booking on Delta through Aeromexico.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:24.180]   And it was actually like a two, two and a half cent value, even in business.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.740]   There is also another trick that I think I haven't talked a lot about because I wasn't
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.820]   sure if it was a good idea.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:33.020]   But if you actually don't fly from the US, if you leave from Mexico, you can still get
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.660]   good value from business class.
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.660]   On Delta.
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.660]   On Delta.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.660]   Booking Delta.
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:38.660]   Through partners.
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.980]   But if you flew to like Mexico City to fly some other airline to like Korea or something,
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.780]   then it's not going to cost you 400,000 points.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.260]   It might only cost you like 100,000 points.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.620]   So if you live in Texas, it might be a good deal.
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.980]   Get to Mexico City and go.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:54.300]   If you live on the West Coast and have kids, it might sound like a nightmare.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.220]   I don't think I would do that if you had kids.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.220]   It's not on the table.
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.780]   Any other cool deals, hacks like that, you know, in the miles world that you want to
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.500]   share before we take off?
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.580]   Nothing I can think of too much right now.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:05.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.580]   I think for the most part, that's it.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.580]   This is so awesome.
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:11.300]   If you want any links to any of the cards we talked about, you can go to all thehacks.com/cards
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.300]   except a few.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.740]   Sebastian, let people know where to find those and everything else you're working on.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.620]   For city cards or for other cards where you want to run the numbers and like play off
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.180]   the calculator, we have that on AskSebi.com.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.180]   You can find me on YouTube at AskSebi and then AskSebiBusiness.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.980]   We'll link to everything in the show notes.
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:28.420]   Sebastian, thank you so much for being here.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.020]   Thank you for having me.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.660]   Thank you so much for joining today.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:37.260]   I feel like I know a lot about cards, but I still picked up a bunch of new things.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:41.700]   And I really hope it's going to help you earn a ton more points this year and next.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.400]   Quick word of caution, I went to apply for the VentureX business after my conversation
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.900]   with Sebastian, but didn't realize that you're not eligible for the card or the bonus if
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:53.500]   you already have the Spark Cash Plus, which I do.
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:54.500]   So I got denied.
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:59.060]   I guess I'm going to have to cancel my Spark Cash Plus before trying again, hopefully before
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:03.300]   that bonus comes down, which right now is 150,000 points.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.700]   But you do need to spend $30,000 in the first three months.
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.820]   Anyways, that's all for this week.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:13.020]   If you're going after any of these cards or bonuses, you can find links to every card
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.420]   at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.180]   And assuming the offers are competitive, I'd really appreciate you using those links and
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:20.700]   supporting the show.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.700]   Thanks in advance.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:27.500]   See you next week.
