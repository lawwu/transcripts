[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.480]   Let the earth rejoice. Let the many coastlands be glad. Clouds and thick darkness are all
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.360]   around him. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. Fire goes before
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.560]   him and burns up his adversaries all around. His lightnings light up the world. The earth
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.640]   sees and trembles. The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, at the presence
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.720]   of the Lord of the whole earth. The heavens declare his righteousness and all the peoples
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.920]   see his glory. Let all those be ashamed who serve graven images, who boast of idols. Worship
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.060]   him, all you gods. Zion heard this and was glad, and the daughters of Judah have rejoiced
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:09.200]   because of your judgments, O Yahweh. For you are Yahweh most high over all the earth. You
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.720]   are exalted far above all gods. Hate evil, you who love Yahweh, who keeps the souls of
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.400]   his holy ones. He delivers them from the hand of the wicked. Light is sown for the righteous
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.760]   and gladness for the upright in heart. Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous ones, and give
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.560]   thanks for the remembrance of his holy name.
