[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100]   It really depends on the downstream task
[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.200]   and also the constraints of their use case.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.580]   Like I believe in a future with a proliferation
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.100]   of different models that are all good
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.580]   at sort of different things.
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.640]   And it's gonna be very individualized,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.540]   almost case by case, what model someone wants to use.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.780]   I think nowadays we're in this interesting micro environment
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.520]   where everyone is just experimenting.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.780]   And so they don't know quite what the use case is.
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.780]   And so maybe the easiest thing is a massive model
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.720]   that can do everything.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.520]   But as the roles that these models play
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.760]   become increasingly clear in these organizations,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.600]   I think there's gonna be a move towards
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.700]   using more domain specific models.
