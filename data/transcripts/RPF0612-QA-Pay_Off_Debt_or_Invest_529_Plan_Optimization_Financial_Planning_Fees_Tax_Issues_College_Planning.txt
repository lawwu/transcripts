[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:36.260]   in worldview that will come through. And there are many organizations that have tried to reflect that. And usually a Christian who is trying to plan their finances will have a different method of analysis than somebody who is not a Christian. Not in everything, but in many things. And this, and that does need to come through. There are organizations that, that have done a good job. I think probably the most prominent one would be Ron
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:36.260]   Blue's organization.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:45:06.200]  , Ron Blue took over for Larry Burkett in Crown Financial Ministries. And he came from an accounting background. They developed a financial advice firm. And I think they've done that. They've done a lot of that in that world. That's probably the biggest one that I'm aware of. Paladin certainly has no affiliation with anything Christian. And again, that's not necessarily a problem. What I would be looking for is I would be looking for somebody who is clearly a Christian.

[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:29.500]   that would be my recommendation. That was great. Both supported my beliefs about Christian marketing and gave some ideas. In case you didn't hear it, you want to set Joshua off. Just label your business Christian. It really bothers me very, very much because it's a scandal and it's a shame to Christians anywhere that that stuff is being said.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.360]   Unfortunately, what has happened is the idea of Christianity has become this basic concept that if you just say you're Christian, everything's great instead of actually demonstrating things in a real way. And the same thing applies in business. It's very, very shameful. Another caller from Florida, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?

[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:19.840]   Yes, I want to stay out of jail. At the same time, I want to go ahead and I'm leaving a lot of money because my dad's second house, which is under my dad's name and me as being a co-signer, he put that house in homestead exemption. So, the house that my mom and my dad left me, which I haven't done any kind of paperwork on it, is not homestead exemption, so I'm paying a lot of taxes as you speak like that.
