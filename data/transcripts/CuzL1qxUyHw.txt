[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   You have all these voices that are telling you you're fucked up and this is going to be hard.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.720]   But for some reason, you put so much practice into you that you can ignore every one of them
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.160]   that are telling you you're not going to fucking make it and still be able to fucking make it.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.120]   Because you have put the practice in that you know this is the process.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.640]   It's such a daunting task that all the voices are saying no.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.480]   But you still had the conviction that I know I can do this.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.040]   And that's what it took for me to get here.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.960]   When you put that practice in every day, you lace them up. And I don't mean run.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.880]   It's just a metaphor for life.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.680]   When you lace them motherfuckers up every day, pretty soon you win.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.320]   You have the courage and the heart and the dedication and the mindset
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.080]   of everybody can go fuck themselves.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.040]   I know what I know.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.000]   I've listened to myself enough to know I know what I know.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.360]   None of you can hear what I'm hearing.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.720]   And that's what people don't do enough of.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.640]   They don't listen to their journey.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.480]   They listen to everybody else's shit.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.640]   You're not looking at the truth in front of you.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   The truth in front of you is it sucks.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.680]   This is what it takes.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.620]   It's creating another voice and sometimes going at it alone.
