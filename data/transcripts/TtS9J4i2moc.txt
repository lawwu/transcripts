[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.060]   - Job hunting, you know, organization,
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.320]   best way to practice answers, things like that,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.040]   you know, in interviews.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.380]   So I'm kind of doing both at the same time.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.400]   Thank you so much.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.240]   Okay, bye.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.760]   - All right, well, first of all,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.680]   tangentially, Jesse, was that the first call we've had
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.160]   where someone seems to actually be walking?
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.280]   - There seemed to be a lot of talk in the background.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.920]   - I heard footsteps.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.600]   Yeah, so I don't, can, the technology we use
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.560]   for people to call in, I guess that must work
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.120]   on your phone, right?
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.040]   - I think so.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.520]   - Okay, so now we know.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.600]   Now we know, we've never heard someone actually walking.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.560]   I think it'd be funny if the reality was,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.040]   Lindsey had a really large media cart,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.720]   and like on the media cart, she had a desktop computer
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.340]   with a monitor and like a keyboard,
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.360]   and then there was another wagon that had a generator in it,
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.400]   and there was like someone pulling the cart
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.880]   and someone pushing the generator,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.360]   and she had like a headset on connected to the computer
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.640]   as she walked, trying to answer the question.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.520]   It's either that or SpeakPipe works on your phone.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.680]   We'll see, but anyways, that's cool.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.640]   So all right, everyone, now we know,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.320]   you can answer these questions from the phone.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.580]   And if you wanna know how to do this, by the way,
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.920]   calnewport.com/podcast, there's a link,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.040]   but it's just a service called SpeakPipe,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.960]   and you like record right from your web browser.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.320]   Okay, so for job interviews,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.300]   so for corporate job interviews,
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.920]   if you're gonna be doing corporate recruiting in particular,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.400]   you gotta practice that too.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.200]   And the way you practice that is it has to be practice
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.060]   specific to those types of interviews.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.040]   Just to give you a little insider look,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.000]   if you're at an elite college, for example,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.180]   and watching people interviewing for banking jobs
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.060]   or consulting jobs, there's practice sessions
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.660]   that they do again and again
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.220]   with sample types of questions.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.780]   How do you answer case questions?
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.020]   How do you answer brainstorming questions?
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.220]   Coders, so let's say you're trying to get a job
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.180]   as a computer programmer at Google,
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.740]   tell you just based on our grad students here at Georgetown,
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.180]   they practice a lot.
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.100]   And there's various tools like LeetCode,
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.060]   I think it's called, where you can practice
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.440]   the types of coding puzzles that they will give you
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.720]   to do on the whiteboards, but it's a very specific skill.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.460]   You have to think about corporate recruiting
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.380]   like you're gonna juggle.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.820]   I gotta practice how to do this.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.660]   Quick personal story, when I was at Dartmouth,
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.240]   I signed up for one of these interviews
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.060]   for a consulting firm.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.060]   And they were doing the first pass on campus.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.280]   And I was like, I don't need to practice.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.020]   I'm a smart guy, I have four Os.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.660]   And just got destroyed because it was so specific.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.820]   I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.860]   Because I did not practice.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.740]   They're like, all right, well, I forgot the question was.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.260]   It was something like, help us walk you through
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.300]   how you think through this question.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.460]   Like how many windows, I think the question was like,
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.140]   how many windows are there in Manhattan?
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.860]   Now to me, I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.700]   I don't know.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.540]   But it turns out, oh, that's a very specific type
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.500]   of question that corporate recruiters ask.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.260]   And there's a method for how you practice it.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260]   And I hadn't practiced it, right?
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.380]   And so that interview went disastrously.
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.540]   So that's all I wanna say is that these type of jobs,
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.540]   especially for elite companies, people practice a lot,
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.500]   specifically a type of interview questions they're gonna do.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.900]   So that is worth finding a course for.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.260]   There's online training tools
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.620]   for different types of interviews.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.900]   There's online courses
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.340]   for doing different types of interviews.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.100]   It is highly specific, so you do wanna practice that.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.340]   So get that practice in.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.180]   And it's just like with the GMAT.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.860]   Once you know, I've done 100 of these type of questions.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.060]   I know how to do these questions.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.460]   I know how to figure out the number of windows in Manhattan.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.540]   I know how to come up with a binary search algorithm
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.980]   on the whiteboard that uses a single array pointer,
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.620]   whatever the challenge is.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.300]   Like I've done it 100 times.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.940]   Then you'll be confident for the interview.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.740]   All right, Jesse, I think we made it.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.700]   I think we made it through a whole episode live
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.700]   of questions and the text seems to be holding up.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.420]   So I mean, I think the only thing we're missing now
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.340]   is we have to figure out,
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.300]   do you think actual live calls might be possible one day?
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.020]   - If people have generators and wheelbarrows
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.860]   that they can take a look.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.540]   - They can move their cars, yeah.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.780]   We will demand that.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.140]   We will demand that you are in the wilderness
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.100]   on a generator with a media cart.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.140]   That's the only thing that stands in our way.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.180]   Actually, I see why not.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.340]   I mean, they could zoom into your computer
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.220]   or something like that.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.660]   And because your computer's hooked up
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.620]   to our mixing board now.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.900]   So, all right, stay tuned everyone.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.300]   But the technology is advancing.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.700]   This was a big step.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.940]   We'll put the full video of this online
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.140]   as soon as that YouTube stuff gets rolling.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.460]   So you can actually see a full episode video
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.780]   if you're curious what it looks like in here.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.420]   But until then, I believe that's a full episode, Jesse.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.660]   So let's call this a wrap.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.260]   (upbeat music)
