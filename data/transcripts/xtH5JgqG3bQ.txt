[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780]   Welcome back and thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John with longtime pastor and author
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.880]   John Piper. I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.520]   Tokophobia is the fear of childbirth. It's the fear of the pain of childbirth, the fear
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020]   of injury during childbirth, both for baby and for mom. And it's a fairly common fear
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.580]   that we hear about in the inbox. The prospect of parenthood can be, of course, alluring,
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.820]   but the pain and the dangers of childbirth are realities to be considered as well. Here
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.260]   specifically is the question I'm talking about. Dear Pastor John, my girlfriend and I have
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.140]   recently started having conversations about our future. She's a God-fearing servant who
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.580]   I can see myself marrying. I also believe she would be a great mother. However, she
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.980]   told me that while she wants to be a mother, she is very fearful of pregnancy and childbirth
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.260]   and said she may only want to adopt. I am fearful that I would harbor some level of
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.380]   bitterness in my heart towards her if we chose to not have biological children of our own.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.100]   Should this be a marriage deal-breaker for us?
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.020]   I think there are three things that I'd like to say in this kind of situation. One is a
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.700]   word of empathy and understanding about the fear of childbirth. Even though I'm not a
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:30.540]   woman, I've got a wife and I've got a Bible. Second is a word about what God has done to
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.820]   address this fear in His Word. And third, what are the implications for your particular
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.260]   relationship and your girlfriend? First, both Scripture and history and all of our experience,
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:56.180]   I think, are sufficient to give a woman pause about bearing children because historically,
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.140]   childbirth has been dangerous. And thousands, dare we say hundreds of thousands, of women
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:13.820]   have died in childbirth or been so injured by the way babies are born that the rest of
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:23.420]   their life was made difficult. And biblically, this pain in childbirth is explicitly rooted
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.340]   in God's response to the disobedience of Adam and Eve in Genesis 3.16, where it says, "To
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.900]   the woman," God said, "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing." In pain, you shall
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.260]   bring forth children. Your desire shall be toward your husband or contrary to your husband,
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.540]   depending on the translation, and he shall rule over you. Now, those are pretty bleak
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.740]   words for a woman. Good grief. It's going to be painful and dangerous to bear children,
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.460]   and you and your husband are going to be in perpetual conflict. In other words, the fall
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.940]   of man and woman into sin brought pain and risk into the act of childbirth and brought
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.300]   pain and relational misery into marriage relationships itself. That's what sin did. That's what
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.740]   the fall did. Selfish desires flowing from the woman and selfish domination flowing from
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:32.420]   the man. So it is understandable that a woman would look with some circumspect seriousness
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.180]   and hesitation about whether to marry at all and whether to risk the pain of childbirth
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.820]   in marriage. I get it, at least from my little bit of experience, makes sense to me. But
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.380]   in the face of all this bad news that comes with the sinfulness of our human hearts, God
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:03.900]   has broken into history in Jesus Christ and is turning things around. Indeed, he was turning
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.140]   them around already before Jesus came, but not decisively like he did when Christ came
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.700]   and the Holy Spirit was poured out and people were grafted into the risen Christ. He's turning
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:24.900]   them around by overcoming the curse of sin in various ways and in stages. Now, Ephesians
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:36.460]   5.25 describes the dramatic reversal of the way husbands treat wives in Christ, no longer
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:46.100]   with arrogant, selfish domination described in Genesis 3.16, but now with humble, gracious
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.280]   leadership described on the analogy of how Christ leads and cares for and provides for
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:02.020]   and protects the church. And I think it is a huge mistake, by the way, to say the husband's
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:10.180]   headship or leadership are obliterated in Christ when in fact they are redeemed and
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:19.540]   transformed, which is quite evident as you read verses 25 to 33 of Ephesians 5. And with
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.380]   regard to the curse on childbearing, let me give you my understanding of a very perplexing
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:35.860]   verse, 1 Timothy 2.15. It says, "Yet she," woman, "yet woman, will be saved through
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.700]   childbearing if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control." Here's
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.940]   what I think that means. And by the way, I did a whole article with all the details at
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.420]   Desiring God called "How Are Women Saved Through Childbearing?" So if you want all
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.540]   the detailed argument behind what I'm gonna sum up now, go to Desiring God and just click
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.060]   on the search button and type in "How Are Women Saved Through Childbearing?" So here's
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:10.020]   my understanding, my paraphrase of that verse. Even though a woman may need to pass through
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:18.460]   the painful remnants of the curse that came on childbearing in Genesis 3, nevertheless
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.660]   she should not see this pain as God's curse in Christ, but rather press on by faith with
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.740]   love and holiness and self-control and thus experience God's complete salvation. That's
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:41.540]   my paraphrase. In other words, 1 Timothy 2.15 is intended to address a woman's fear that,
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.660]   I suppose, yes, legitimately arises from the curse of Genesis 3.16, address that fear,
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:55.460]   and the encouragement is this. "While childbearing is still hard, nevertheless you will come
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.780]   through it. In Christ the deepest dangers of the curse have been removed. The pain of
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:09.320]   childbearing will not be an obstacle to your full and complete enjoyment of salvation in
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.380]   Christ." And I think the words of Jesus in John 16.21 point in the same direction when
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:21.660]   he says, "When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come." In
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.980]   other words, it's gonna hurt. "But when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:35.140]   the anguish for joy that a human being has been born into the world." In other words,
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:42.740]   the pain of childbirth is not an end in itself, and by God's grace in Christ leads to great
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:49.140]   joy, just like resurrection brings joy after the sufferings of Jesus, which leads finally
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:55.420]   to the question now of your relationship. God's transformation of arrogant, selfish,
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:02.780]   male domination in marriage into a humble, gracious leadership in marriage is closely
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:11.940]   tied to God's transformation of childbirth as a curse into childbirth as a painful path
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:20.220]   to extraordinary joy. I think the question every man has to ask at the front end of marriage—indeed,
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:28.140]   every woman has to ask—is whether, by faith in God's wisdom and grace and power, you
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:37.140]   are willing to enter into a relationship where there will be gracious, humble involvement
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:46.780]   of the wife in plotting out the paths of this life together, together with faithful, confident,
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:53.620]   Godward submission of the wife to the husband's leadership. That combination. Are you both
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:00.520]   willing to step into that? Both husband and wife have to look that dynamic square in the
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:10.820]   face and decide whether they believe this is God's revealed, wise, loving pattern for
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:17.660]   marriage, and therefore whether he will provide every need that you have to live joyfully
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.780]   in it, which in this case, the one we're talking about right here, in this case, I
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:33.380]   think means for you as the man, do you discern in this woman such a deep trust in God and
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:45.420]   such a discerning confidence in your leadership that should you want biological children as
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:53.300]   God leads you, she would be willing to trust God for that. She needs to know you will not
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:10:02.300]   ride roughshod over her fears, and you need to know she will gladly trust God with your
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   leadership.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:09.340]   Amen. That's a very wise pastoral word here, Pastor John. Thank you. And thank you for
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.460]   listening to search or browse our entire episode archive, or to send us a new question of your
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:21.500]   own, go to our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn. Well, by God's grace, this is a podcast that's
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.900]   heard around the world by a lot of different people, and that means when we dive into the
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:31.660]   most sensitive questions and fears that people face, like today, or into the deepest pain
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:37.740]   of people's lives, which is what we'll do next time, we do so at a principled level.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.380]   We try to offer pointers to scripture. We're never trying to replace the necessary pastors
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.060]   and the counselors and even the Christian friends that God has put into our lives for
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.500]   face-to-face care. That's irreplaceable. And with that said, next time we field a really
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:59.340]   painful email from a man in England who is struggling with unforgiveness as he reflects
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.260]   back on years of childhood abuses inflicted on him by his parents. It's a heavy question,
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.820]   and it is up next time. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.820]   [END]
