[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   [Music]
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:12.880]   [Farsi]
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.640]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.560]   That's what you just heard in Farsi from our friend Mo.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.680]   Mo is bringing Desiring God resources to Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.440]   Incredible work.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.080]   You will want to hear the story in just a minute, but first we get to today's question here on this Wednesday.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.520]   What is a good musical worship experience?
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.800]   That's today's question from a listener to the podcast by the name of Jeff.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.240]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.080]   I know many Christians speak of a good worship experience as one associated with an emotional response,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.640]   and I have several relatives that will say a good worship experience is tied to the quality of the music,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.160]   how well the musicians sing and performed on stage,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.680]   and they will defend popular Christian worship bands who hold to a theology that's a little bit weak,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.600]   but defend the songs because of the personal emotional high that they cause.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.360]   As a result, my relatives will say things like the worship experience was "very powerful."
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.000]   We even know of a local church that doesn't allow children in the singing portion
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.840]   because it distracts from the worship experience.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   So my question for you, Pastor John, is this.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.640]   What makes for a good musical worship experience?
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000]   I put that question to Pastor John in Nashville.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.680]   Here he is.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.120]   Well, not taking the kids out,
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.440]   Noel and I wrote an article in our first year or two at Bethlehem
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.680]   making the case that we will not have a children's church,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.000]   but the children will be in worship services after age, I don't know what we chose, three, something like that.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:09.440]   And my argument was where else will a three, four, five, six, seven year old boy, say boy,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:19.440]   learn what the heart of a mature man toward God is if he doesn't see his dad sing,
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.720]   if he doesn't see his dad pray, if he doesn't see his dad bow down in holy reverence.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.600]   And so there's so much more going on in a good experience of worship.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:42.800]   So the other thing that came to my mind when I heard that question was that the word experience is viewed negatively
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.520]   because it's got connotations of empty emotionalism.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.040]   And all that was just an experience.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.400]   But the word experience in English is necessary.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.560]   I mean, it's a good word.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.800]   Worship is an experience.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.360]   It is.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.840]   And it needs to be fleshed out as what kind of experience it is.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:14.160]   And what makes it good is that there is truth and there is response to that truth in understanding.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760]   And there is worth and beauty and greatness.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.520]   And there is response to that in affections.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.920]   Now, that little summary there came from a sentence from Jonathan Edwards.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.880]   So Jonathan Edwards says, God glorifies himself in the world in two ways.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:43.680]   He glorifies himself by his glory being seen, meaning known, understood.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.960]   And his glory being delighted in.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:55.600]   He who sees God's glory does not glorify him so much as he who also delights in that glory.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.200]   Now, when I read that sentence, I thought, "He's so absolutely right."
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.920]   And you heard me say yesterday, God will not be half glorified,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.000]   meaning he doesn't want a doctrinally straight church with zero experience of affections.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And he doesn't want a church with all over the top emotions and affections
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.080]   and almost no rich understanding of the nature of God and what he's done in the world.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.320]   And so what I'm looking for in a good experience of worship is,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.560]   is there richness of truth here, truth in the welcome, truth in the prayers,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.280]   truth in the preaching, truth in the singing and the lyrics of the song.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.040]   He's just permeated with the Bible truth that is loved in this church.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.640]   And do these people give some evidence it makes a difference?
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.160]   Like it touches anybody.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.400]   Does anybody feel anything here?
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   Because if this church is totally blank, I mean, it is emotionless.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.200]   I'm thinking God is not prized here.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.560]   God is not valued here.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.000]   God is not cherished here.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.680]   God is not enjoyed here.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.800]   That's just not worship.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.880]   I don't care how true the doctrine is or how straight the preaching is.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.160]   So those are just massively crucial things, I think, for worship to be a good experience.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.080]   Now, all of that, I think, presumes, or maybe I shouldn't presume it,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.720]   that the chief actors in worship are the congregation.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.040]   This conference is all about how you lead in order to make that happen,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:50.240]   but it's the congregation singing or praying or confessing or reciting.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:59.200]   The congregation is the worshiping body with the help of people who are musicians or leaders
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.320]   from the front, which implies, now, what would that be?
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.440]   What would the good leadership be to make that happen so that the people are singing,
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.240]   the people are praying, the people are reciting,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.440]   the people are confessing authentically from the heart?
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.040]   And I wrote down the leader will notâ€¦
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.920]   I used the term "undistracting excellence" is needed from the leaders.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.440]   Undistracting, you don't get in the way.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.920]   So not shoddy, because that's going to distract.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.040]   You make mistakes, people are going to be jarred and won't be able to keep focusing.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.480]   Not ostentatious.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.760]   That means you're too good and you're showing off on the piano
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.400]   or whatever instrument you're playing.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.560]   Not entertaining, not calling attention to themselves.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.560]   I mean, the tension in this conference is significant, isn't it?
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.280]   This is a largely performance-oriented conference.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.280]   Even though you're singing a lot, these are remarkable things going on up here,
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.920]   and they could easily intimidate a lot of pastors that they can't do anything like that.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   And I know Keith and Kristen don't want that to happen to any pastor in the room.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.520]   They want a 30-person church with lay leadership and no education in music
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.760]   to be powerful in connecting with God on Sunday morning, which is very possible.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.240]   So not calling attention to themselves.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.760]   And then maybe lastly, I wrote a list of things that I think,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.040]   in a good experience, you'd look for in the music.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.800]   One, it's singable.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.040]   It's singable by men.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   Men, M-E-N.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.560]   Men.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.320]   Because I was just talking with another remarkable music theoretician back there over lunch,
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.880]   and he was talking about the changes of the last 30 years.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.080]   And one of the changes, he said, is that the register has gone up.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:59.920]   So then I would say, in our service at home, too often, I have to say,
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.560]   I think I look at people, "The men just dropped out.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.160]   Did you know, did anybody notice no men are singing right now?
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.760]   Or they shift to a lower octave, and that sounds weird."
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.480]   I was like, "They were doing just great right here, then..."
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.560]   [imitates low octave singing]
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.360]   "What just happened?"
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.120]   So the scope of singability, and I actually think it's crucial that the men sing.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.480]   It's almost a given that women sing.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.720]   Women seem to have an easier ability to get all over the range on these things.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.800]   Men, we're not so good at that.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.280]   We need a lot of help to sing.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.680]   And when the men are singing, oh my goodness,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.560]   that really helps the women, helps the children, helps everybody view this God better, I think.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.320]   Emotionally suitable, truth-carried lyrics, lyrics that are seriously joyful,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.960]   lyrics that are God-centered, Christ-exalting, Bible-saturated, gospel-rich.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.560]   And then I have to say one more thing, Tony, because this is what I write about,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.000]   this is what I did for 33 years.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.120]   Don't ever talk about, "We worship for 30 minutes and then we preach."
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.560]   I'll get my back up if you say that.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.960]   I'm a preacher and I worship.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.200]   Preaching is worship.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:23.040]   It ought to be, I call it, expository exaltation.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.840]   Because it's not just music that should have truth components and affectional components.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.960]   Preaching should have truth components and affectional components.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.960]   So expository, I really am explaining the Bible,
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.360]   drawing meaning out of the Bible that's really there.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.080]   And I'm really thrilled about it.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.120]   Can anybody tell?
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.800]   That's what I want.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.200]   I want, that's what preaching is.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:53.760]   It helps people see the truth and then be caught up with the preacher
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.920]   in his love affair with that God and that salvation.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:05.280]   So I think a good experience, a good worship experience will have at least all of that.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.000]   [Conan] That's good.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   [Applause]
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.000]   [John] Wow, such a great time.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.960]   Thanks to all of you who showed up to the live recording in Nashville.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.160]   It was loud and engaged, as you can hear from this audio,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.480]   and it was great to meet many of you after the recording.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.720]   Well, I mentioned at the start of this episode that a team of friends are working to bring
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.080]   Desiring God resources to non-English speaking countries,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.560]   and that includes a friend of ours named Mo.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.640]   You heard his voice earlier, and we asked him for an update on his work.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.160]   Here's what he said.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.480]   My name is Mohammad Sanavi.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.960]   I was born in Iran.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.680]   I'm a founder and director of the ministry called Bible Training Center for Persians.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.560]   My ministry is among Farsi speakers.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.440]   There are three countries people speak Farsi.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.000]   Iran, Afghanistan, and part of Tajikistan.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.920]   So, whatever we do is to reach those three countries.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:08.960]   The material that we have translated into Farsi from the Desiring God are solid joys,
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:16.720]   the good news of the great joy, and many of the pastors' John's sermons.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:28.960]   In the last year, I noticed every few days on my social media, I have a deleted contact.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.120]   They're all my Afghani friends.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.280]   They're the pastors, they're the teachers who are working in Afghanistan.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.720]   And then, boom, we saw it on TV what happened.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.640]   The Afghanistan fell in the hand of Taliban.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.600]   I said, "No wonder these people are deleting themselves from us,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.360]   because it could be a very dangerous situation for them."
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.840]   Months passed, and all of a sudden, I got a phone call.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.840]   It's unknown.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.360]   I don't know who that person is.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.120]   I answered the person, and it was one of my Afghani's friends.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.840]   He was a very devoted, he's a very devoted Christian.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.800]   Very devoted minister.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:25.200]   In the back of my mind, I'm thinking, probably he wants me to help him to get out of Afghanistan.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.880]   And finally, I said, "Brother, what can I do for you?"
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.960]   The answer I heard from him embarrassed me.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.400]   He said, "Just pray for us.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.320]   I call you to let you know we need to have a stronger faith to stay here.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.560]   Just pray for us and do one thing.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.480]   Can you send me audio sermons every few weeks?
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.600]   Just one thing to encourage us to stay in our country."
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:58.160]   I said, "What about if I give you the full Advent devotion?"
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.680]   He loved it.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.840]   And I said, "And after that, I'm going to give you daily devotion,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.360]   three to five minutes devotion, every day for the rest of the year."
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.880]   He was so excited.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.840]   He said, "Do you have it?"
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:16.240]   I said, "Yes, we have already worked on the good news of the great joy.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.360]   We already worked on the solid joys, and they are ready.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.160]   I will make sure that you receive it.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.680]   Send me a contact information.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.280]   I will send it to you."
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:36.560]   He received it, and then later he told me, "I listened to every devotion over and over
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.160]   every day, and it burned my heart.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.760]   It made me fall in love with Jesus more and more."
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.680]   Thank you so much, brother.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:53.360]   Who knew that in God knowing the future, we are working on this for the Iranian,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.880]   but in fact, it was for the Afghanis because they needed that.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.840]   Whatever I do, I want people to fall in love with Jesus,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.560]   make their relationship deeper with Jesus,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.600]   to come to the point that they are ready to die for Jesus.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.280]   That's what I love about this Iranian God.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.880]   God is using every penny that people are giving to this organization
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.200]   to bring more and more people to the cross.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.400]   So, keep doing what you are doing.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:35.760]   We don't know how many people converted because of the $5, the $10, $100 that you gave.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.320]   When we go to heaven, God is going to say, "Well done, my children.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.720]   See who are the people here because of your commitment."
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.420]   Thank you.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.280]   Amazing testimony.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.320]   So brilliant to hear this.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.640]   Thank you, Mo, for your faithful labors in these hard places.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.800]   If you're listening right now and you gave to Desiring God's Work in 2022,
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.120]   you made Mo's work possible, and I bet you didn't even know it.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.720]   So, thank you for your partnership.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.120]   If you're not yet a partner and you want to join in what's happening through Desiring God's
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.800]   resources in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, join us today.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   Become a monthly ministry partner.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.120]   Much of our financial support comes from friends of ours who give, on average,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.440]   $30 a month to support the work.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.760]   To set up monthly giving, go to give.desiringgod.org.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   That's give.desiringgod.org.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.800]   Hugely appreciated.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.000]   We are going to be back on Friday.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.800]   We'll see you then.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:41.840]   you
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:42.640]   you
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.140]   you
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.100]   you
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.600]   you
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:45.640]   you
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.440]   you
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
