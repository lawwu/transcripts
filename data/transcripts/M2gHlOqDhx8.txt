[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   And this will be our, our look at the issue of life after
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.760]   school to give to all of our recent graduates or graduates
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.160]   to be who are out there in the audience.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.520]   I'm Kyle Newport, and this is Deep Questions.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.880]   The show about living and working deeply in a distracted world.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.600]   Here in my Deep Work HQ, joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.080]   Jesse, hear me stumble a little bit on the line because I was getting in my
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.800]   head about getting rid of in an increasingly distracted world, and I
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.640]   was getting ahead of that.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.480]   Don't forget to do that.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.160]   I stumbled over the earlier words.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.080]   I noticed.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.160]   It's kind of a sectarian battle right now amidst our listeners about the pro
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.240]   in increasing people and the anti in increasing people, the audience is about
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.760]   split. I listen to a lot of talk radio, so I'm always listening to the way
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.920]   they enunciate and stuff.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.440]   Well, that was not a masterclass.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.960]   The way I just pronounced that, that subhead, but I'll tell you what, you
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.840]   know what, I just picked up, speaking of unrelated topics, I just picked up my
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.080]   faculty academic regalia.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.280]   Is that a robe?
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.920]   It's the robe and the weird puffy hat, the medieval dress of the faculty
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.880]   member with a doctorate in the.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.360]   So for graduation?
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.000]   For graduation.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.200]   Cause you have to go to every graduation.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.000]   I actually have never been to graduations.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.080]   I don't, I don't normally go to graduations, but I have a doctoral student.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.720]   Oh, he's got a doctoral student's graduate, just got his PhD or he got it
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.200]   earlier in the year, but this is the commencement and there's a, there's a
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.960]   tradition when you get your PhD or your advisor is called hooding and your, your
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.720]   advisor, it's like, it's passing on the mantle and everyone dresses up in these,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.880]   these fancy regalia.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.000]   My last student didn't go to that.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.680]   Cause of COVID?
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.160]   No, that was before.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.680]   Um, for whatever reason, I guess he had already, he had, you know, I think often
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.320]   what happens is you, you graduate when you're done, but the ceremonies
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.560]   happen during graduation week.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.040]   So a lot of times the students are, he had already moved on and got a job
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   and, uh, he moved back to China.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.600]   Um, but this, my current student graduated closer to this.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.200]   He lives nearby.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.560]   So, so we're going to do it.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.320]   So I have regalia.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   It was, I bring it up because it has always been a tradition in my writing.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.760]   And I guess now in my podcasting that when we get to graduation season, I want
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.800]   to give some sort of commencement address type advice to the new graduates and a
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.880]   particular advice about entering the job force and thinking about your career.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   It was actually, and this is a little insider Cal Newport detail.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.320]   It was attending a graduation, one of my sister's graduations, where I wrote a
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.560]   blog post, it's a long time ago.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.760]   And that's where I first introduced the idea of Lifestyle-Centered Career Planning.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.320]   That's what first got me thinking about careers and led to my first general
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.520]   audience book in 2012, which was So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.320]   And so it's been this tradition that when graduation season comes, I like to give
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.560]   advice about what, how to think about work, how to think about life outside of school.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.640]   And I'll say, Jesse, sometimes I forget that not everyone has spent their entire
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.640]   adult life on a college campus like I have.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.280]   So to me, these seasons, like a course is graduation season.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.880]   It's all that's happening, but for most people, it's not, it's just May or whatever.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.280]   So I have to remember that, okay, not everyone has lived their entire
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.720]   adult life on a college campus, but for us, it's, it's, it's in our bones.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.920]   So here's what I was going to do today.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.800]   Coincidentally, fortunately, and coincidentally, an author I know, a fellow
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.920]   author at the same imprint that I published my books at at Penguin, Simone
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.560]   Stolzoff has a book that just came out.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.800]   It came out, I believe it comes out the day this podcast airs or day before the
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.720]   day after, but right around you're hearing this podcast, this new book is coming out.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.800]   The book is called The Good Enough Job Reclaiming Life From Work, which I think
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.840]   is, is provocative and interesting.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.560]   And I read it and I blurbed it and I liked it.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   And I said, you know what, Simone, why don't you come on the show?
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.000]   We'll do our deep dive together.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.200]   I can talk to you about your book and your ideas, and this will be our, our look
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.960]   at the issue of life after school to give to all of our recent graduates or graduates
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.360]   to be who are out there in the audience.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.960]   So I asked him, if he'd come on the show, if he would call in and he said he would.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   So I'm looking forward to talking with Simone Stolzoff, author of The Good Enough Job.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.400]   All right.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.280]   So Jesse, let's see if we can get Simone on the line.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.000]   Sounds good.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.560]   All right.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.360]   Simone, thank you for calling into the show to talk about your new book.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.240]   I have to say, when I heard from your editor about this book and, Hey, do
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   you want to see an early copy?
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.280]   This is one of those ones where the title is all I needed to say a hundred percent.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.680]   Yes.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.720]   The Good Enough Job.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.960]   I was on board at that point already.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.040]   I said, of course, I know, I know we're speaking the same language here.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.840]   I'm going to like it.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.920]   And I wasn't disappointed.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.680]   But thanks for coming on.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.960]   You are going to help us help mold young minds.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.560]   This is our commencement era, the commencement period episode where we dive
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.520]   into the element of how does work fit into a fulfilling life?
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.360]   And I think your book's got a lot of great ideas.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.960]   So I wanted to start before we got into the ideas of the book is just briefly your
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.600]   story.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.680]   I'm going to give you the rough bullet points I know.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.400]   And then you tell me the reality or you fill in the gaps there, because I think
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.080]   there's probably a lot captured here.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.040]   So from what I understand, you were a design lead at IDEO, the sort of fantastic
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.000]   design shop.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.880]   Then you moved on, I guess, on your own.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.240]   So doing design and business consulting and then decided to write this book.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.120]   Those are the big level bullet points.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.360]   What are the interesting details I'm missing here?
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.040]   I mean, thankfully for maybe some of our listeners, I graduated college a little
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.400]   bit more recently than you did.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.960]   But I spent my 20s really playing Goldilocks with careers.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.560]   So I graduated.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.760]   I was studying poetry and economics.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.240]   So you could already see this sort of tension between art and commerce in my
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.160]   life and moved back to my hometown of San Francisco.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.520]   And I worked in advertising for a few years and then I worked in tech for a few
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.160]   years.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.400]   And then I started working in journalism.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.560]   And really the impetus for the book was this moment where I was reached out to by
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.760]   a recruiter at this design consultancy called IDEO.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.960]   And it really sent me for an existential loop.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.440]   It felt like I was choosing not just between two jobs, but between two versions
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.800]   of me.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.960]   You know, one path being the journalist and the other path being the designer.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.360]   And maybe for some of our recent grads that are listening to this episode, they've
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.480]   been at a similar kind of career crossroads.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.640]   And so I couldn't make up my mind for the life of me.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.200]   On one hand, it's like, oh, the agony of deciding between two attractive job paths.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.440]   But on the other hand, you know, how we spend those hours matters as a polymath
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.960]   like you very much knows.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.000]   And so the question of the book was sort of how did work become so central to our
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.680]   identities, to our sense of self-worth and what to make of it?
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.960]   And that's what I'm excited to chat with you about today.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.760]   Right. So even the fact that that was a fraught crossroads is itself telling, you're
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.160]   saying. The fact that it felt so important in the moment as if you were making
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.520]   decision about the definition of yourself as a person or the core of your lifestyle
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.360]   was about to be determined by do you follow more of the journalistic path or go to
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.480]   go to IDEO. So then how did you end up freeing from that mindset or getting that
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.600]   distance to say, wait a second, I think there's something that's malformed in the way
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.960]   our culture deals with this?
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think it was out of necessity.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.280]   You know, I was I was suffering, thinking that I had made the wrong choice.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.720]   And, you know, short story is that I ended up leaving journalism and the trendy magazine
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.560]   that I was writing for to join IDEO.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.800]   And it felt like I had turned off part of who I was and I had made this
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.920]   irreconcilable mistake and that the journalism industry would never have me back.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.600]   And, you know, spoiler alert, leaving the newsroom was actually the best thing that
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.840]   happened to my writing career.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.440]   But obviously I couldn't have foreseen that.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.520]   But I think, you know, what ultimately helped was just having a healthy level of
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.640]   detachment, a level of of distance from rising and falling with my professional
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.200]   accomplishments. And I think it's particularly true here in the U.S.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.160]   where what you do is often the first question we ask each other when we meet, where
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.720]   our productivity and our self-worth are so tightly bound.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.320]   I think what I was missing was perspective to understand that work is part of who I
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.040]   am. That's one source of meaning in my life, but it is not the entirety of who I was.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.400]   And that realization was ultimately what helped me develop a healthier relationship to
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.160]   work moving forward.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   Now, that happened after you left IDEO or at some point while you were there.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.240]   When did that come?
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.680]   I think while I was there, you know, in the first few months I was insufferable.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.760]   You know, I was thinking, oh, I've made this awful mistake.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.680]   Is the journalism industry ever going to let me back in?
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.320]   Will all of my former colleagues think I sold out?
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.560]   You know, and I think one insight from a career's perspective is that the decisions we
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.720]   make in our careers are much more reversible than we might think.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.000]   You know, you think you go on one path and there's never going to be an opportunity for
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.600]   you to do what you once did again.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.960]   And that's simply not true.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.720]   You know, some of the most interesting people and professionals that I know have had
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.640]   more of meandering paths, you know, look at you like you have always maintained a few
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.200]   different professional identities.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.520]   And for me, I've learned that switching between these different modes of working has
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.240]   actually helped me, you know, scratch all these different itches of my interests and also
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.080]   conceive of a job as what it is, you know, a job and not the entirety of who I am.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.040]   Right. This is an interesting opportunity right now.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.440]   Here is why X, Y and Z.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.240]   Let's do this for a while.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.400]   Like this will fit in well with this other image of the city it's in.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.360]   I want to live there. There's some interesting people.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.600]   The income maybe is going to open up some other options.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.440]   And and then a few years from now, if you need to reconsider that, you can reconsider
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.800]   it. I mean, yeah, I would say it sounds like a European perspective, which I mean,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.840]   mainly as a diss against America, because we have we do have I have very international,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.960]   a very international audience and it is very regional specific how people think about
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.280]   how people think about careers.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.760]   I joke the German version of my career book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.320]   I love the German version because it's it's a newspaper with a fake headline and it's the
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.000]   the dream job lie.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.040]   But in like really stark German, it's great.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.880]   It's all one word.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.680]   Yeah, it's all one word. They have a word.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.040]   Funnily enough, yeah, it's a job for how I am.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.400]   That definitely has played a part.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.600]   You know, I am multicultural.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.640]   My mom's side of the family is Italian.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.360]   You know, my name is Simone Luca.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.560]   And I think there's just a different conception of workplace in our life.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.680]   I've loved one thing that you've talked about in the past, which is the difference between
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.760]   treating work as sort of the central axis around which the rest of your life orbits and
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.960]   starting with your vision of a life well lived and thinking about how your work or your
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.440]   career can support that vision.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.280]   You know, I think in the United States we often miss the forest for the trees.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.040]   We often think that, you know, what you do for work is the most consequential decision
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.680]   you make. And then the rule is that you have to shove your life into the margins.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.440]   But I think, you know, in the town that my mom grew up in, for example, in Puglia in
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.440]   southern Italy, you know, it's a very different conception.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.680]   All my cousins, you know, they don't leave town for college.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.160]   They tend to work in the industry that their parents worked in.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.240]   And work is more of a means to an end than an end in and of itself.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.880]   And not to say that any particular path is better or worse than the other.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.280]   But I do think that Americans could learn a thing or two about less work centric
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.720]   cultures. Right.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.320]   And that's why you're in a good position to think about that, not just your personal
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.240]   experience, but you have your family experience.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.360]   So in pulling out this thread a little bit more about what led to the book.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.800]   So what was the I guess you went back and started writing more.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.960]   Do I have this right? So you returned to journalism to some degree, writing for a lot of
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.720]   interesting, a lot of interesting pieces for a lot of top publications.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.320]   Talk about that transition back towards introducing more writing and then how that
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.520]   eventually led to the idea maybe I should actually write a book.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.880]   Yeah. So it started as a desire to keep my writing muscles from atrophying.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.240]   You know, maybe this is relatable in periods of your life when you're doing more
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.920]   research or more teaching.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.520]   You know, writing is a skill and you need to practice it in order to keep it up.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.040]   And so I was working this design job and was looking for a way to have some
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.720]   commitment to continue to have to write.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.960]   And so I was a freelancer for places like the Atlantic and Wired.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.640]   And I was really writing about work culture from a broad sense.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.800]   And a colleague of mine, Derek Thompson, coined this term "workism," which I loved so
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.080]   much. It's the idea that a lot of Americans and particularly college educated
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.680]   Americans are treating work akin to a religious identity.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.520]   So instead of looking to work just for a paycheck, they're also looking to work for
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.600]   community and purpose and transcendence.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.640]   And, you know, Derek argues that this is a burden that our jobs are just not designed
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.480]   to bear. And that resonated with me so deeply from both the personal standpoint, but
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.800]   also from what I was observing in the labor market.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.120]   You know, in our country, we treat CEOs like celebrities and we plaster "always do
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.200]   what you love" on the walls of our co-working spaces.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.800]   And, you know, I think there's a few risks to this.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.960]   For one, as many people have found out in the past few years, your job might not
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.800]   always be there. You know, if your job is your identity and you lose your job, what's
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:28.000]   left? And then the second is, you know, just the expectations that places on our job.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.600]   I like thinking about happiness as sort of the difference between our expectations and
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.280]   our reality. And if we have these sky high expectations of what a job can deliver, it
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.600]   just leaves a lot of room for disappointment.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.560]   And the third is, you know, what I get into towards the end of the book is that by
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.360]   centering work, we can neglect other aspects of who we are.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.120]   You know, we are not just workers.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.360]   Our purpose on this planet is not just to produce economic returns for corporations.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.040]   We are also neighbors and parents and siblings and friends and citizens.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:09.400]   And on the other side of sort of prioritizing work is the ability to prioritize other
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.880]   aspects of life, other aspects of who we are, other things that can bring meaning to our
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.280]   lives.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.560]   Yeah. Well, where do you think and when thinking about it, we can use the workism term
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.600]   when you're thinking about that pervasive influence.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.840]   There's no doubt that it is beneficial to employers.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.160]   So if your employees really subscribe to work as their sense of transcendent meaning,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.480]   then, well, I mean, of course I'm going to stay late because this is what my life is
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.520]   about. But what's your thought?
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.600]   What's your take on where this originates from?
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.320]   Because it often seems to me that it's advantageous to employers, but there's a more
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.560]   complicated cultural story here, maybe even a more haphazard cultural story than there
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.680]   was, you know, a conference room where a bunch of mustache twirlers got together and
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.840]   said, let us invent this culture and then we'll get longer hours.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.520]   It seems there's probably it's a complicated story.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.600]   So what you did all this deep reporting.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.400]   We're going to get more into the guts of the book here in a second, but I just want to
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.120]   preview that it really goes its deep profile style.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.720]   So it actually spends time with different characters and their interactions with their
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.040]   job and their disappointments.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.520]   And so you've really been been sort of deep into the cultural matrix here.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.040]   So what's your what's your take when you're trying to detangle where American workism
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.960]   what its actual roots are?
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.840]   What are the different forces that contribute to it?
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.640]   Yeah, I mean, there's a few ways in, you know, there are historical factors, cultural,
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.280]   economic, political. You know, one is just the foundation of our country.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:46.160]   If you think back to the early days, the Protestant work ethic and capitalism were really
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.960]   the two strands that entwined to form our country's DNA.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.800]   But, you know, this trend of workism and or you might want to call it the culture of
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:03.000]   overwork in America is really pronounced in the past 40 or 50 years.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.040]   So that begs the question, you know, what happened?
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.000]   What has changed in the past 40 or 50 years?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.400]   In the 1970s, the average American and the average German worked almost the exact same
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.680]   number of hours each year.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.040]   And now the average American works about 30 percent more.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.680]   So how do we get here?
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:24.520]   You know, I think the argument that I focus on in the book is the sort of subjective value
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.400]   that Americans give to work.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.880]   So with the decline of other sources of meaning and community, like organized religion,
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:39.920]   like different sorts of neighborhood groups, the desire for purpose and belonging and
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.160]   meaning remains.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.560]   And many Americans have just transposed that to the workplace where they spend the
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.840]   majority of our time.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.480]   I mean, you can look at other factors like the fact that we tie health care to employment
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.360]   in this country. You know, like one of the reasons why our relationship to work is so
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.520]   fraught here is because the consequences of losing work are so dire.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.200]   You know, I'm thinking about, you know, former colleagues of mine who were on visas
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.920]   where their ability to even live in this country was contingent on them maintaining a
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.200]   W-2 job.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.720]   But, you know, there's lots of different factors that play into it.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:24.280]   And I think as you've so eloquently documented in the past, we're sort of seeing the
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:30.800]   pushback to the work centricity movement of the early aughts and, you know, girl bossing
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.880]   and hustle culture.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:37.280]   And now everyone, for better or for worse, is renegotiating their relationship to work
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.080]   coming out of the pandemic, which is why I'm so excited to be chatting with you, who has
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.040]   also thought so deeply about these things.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.800]   Do you think the pandemic, as part of what's going on here, is that remote work done from
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:56.880]   your apartment, for example, transforms the activity into an abstraction and almost
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.640]   something like an absurdity?
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.240]   Like, once it's actually reduced, you're sitting at home and maybe like your partner's
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.320]   there and you can hear what they're doing and it's just on email.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:11.000]   And it's something about removing yourself from the physical location of work, emphasize
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.320]   the sort of absurdist or somewhat abstract nature of a lot of white collar work in
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.920]   particular, and that there's some sort of then theological, like a crisis of faith of
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.520]   wait a second.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.840]   This is what I'm pinning my self-worth on.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.200]   I mean, I know the pandemic was an accelerant.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.600]   This is where we got the great resignation.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.480]   I think Derek has written well about really trying to pick apart what's really happening
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.280]   there. But there's trends in there that are useful.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.960]   Quiet quitting then came along.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.280]   All this is pandemic induced cultural change.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.680]   So we know the pandemic had an issue.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:48.240]   I'm interested in that idea that the inherent absurdities of digital knowledge work became
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.360]   hard to miss. And that was, you know, that was the Wizard of Oz curtain got separated a
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.280]   little bit. Wait a second.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.520]   It's the mayor moving, moving, you know, whatever.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.320]   Like there was a bit of a broken, the illusion was broken.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.440]   I don't know. What do you think about the pandemic?
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.760]   What about the pandemic helped magnify this long festering, sort of 20 year long festering
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.680]   unease that was growing?
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.960]   Yeah, I think, you know, what you just said reminds me of Marx and sort of the alienation
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.320]   or the atomization of work, you know, back when work moved from a craft based economy
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.440]   where people were either farming or making things with their hands into an industrial
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.360]   economy where people were making things in factories.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:33.920]   One of Marx's biggest fears was that we would become divorced from what we're actually
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:39.120]   creating. You know, if you're just on an assembly line, adding one part to a widget, it's
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.160]   very different from, you know, getting in touch with the natural ebb and flow of the
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.280]   seasons and making something for someone who you know will be using it.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.760]   I think that's to a certain extent what's happened in the pandemic, too.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:58.280]   It's revealed some of the, you know, quote unquote bullshit jobs that a lot of us do.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.160]   You know, I'm reminded of this one woman, Aubrey, who I talked to in the middle of the
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.640]   pandemic, who had just quit her job.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.480]   And she said, you know, the pandemic for me was an existential slap in the face.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:15.960]   It made me question, you know, is my worth in this world really my ability to, you know,
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.360]   contribute to my sales goal number for some tech company that I don't care about?
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:25.280]   And so I think that's one side of it is just the kind of the absurdity that a lot of
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:31.800]   people felt when you remove all the other elements of work, like the social side of it
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.520]   or the ability to interact with people on a day to day basis.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.520]   A lot of people found themselves for better, for worse, pushing numbers around
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.400]   spreadsheets. I think the second is just the ability to face our own mortality.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:52.240]   And, you know, people were looking in the news and death was all around us and people
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.000]   were questioning, wow, is this is this how I'm going to spend my time?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.240]   And the third is people were able to see a different way.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.280]   You know, people who hadn't been able to spend quality time with their children during
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.840]   the middle of the day were able to see what a more sort of balanced life between work
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.480]   and home is that to the extent that, you know, commuting two hours each day bordered on
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.640]   the absurd. And now we're, you know, we're picking up the pieces and people are trying
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.680]   to make sense of where we are now with, you know, remote work or hybrid work.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.120]   I think the one thing that we can say is true across the board is everyone's work
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.400]   changed a certain degree.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.680]   You know, at the extremes, people were laid off or furloughed and forced to figure out
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.640]   who they were without their job.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.160]   But even people who are able to maintain their work, I'm sure lots of the listeners to
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:48.400]   your podcast and sort of these knowledge economy jobs, work isn't the same today as it
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.480]   was in twenty nineteen.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.840]   And people are rightfully so questioning what role they want work to have in their lives
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.000]   moving forward. You know, one of the things I like you did with your book, because it
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   gets a nice complimentary point to what we just discussed.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.200]   So right now we're talking about how the pandemic, among other things, maybe point out
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.280]   some of the absurdities of some of these spreadsheet and email jobs.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:15.600]   I like how in your book you also talked and spent time with people who represented the,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.840]   I guess, traditional response to that, which is what I need is if the if the content of
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.480]   my work is radically different or engaging enough, then the work can be meaning.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.760]   I'm thinking in particular about the chef you spent time with because that's that's the
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.000]   classic counterpoint.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.600]   OK, yes, I'm on email that you write.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.840]   This job is terrible.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.440]   I'm going to throw away my tie and become a chef or, you know, whatever the the visions
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.200]   or professional full time novelist or something like this.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.520]   And that's often a storyline.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:47.720]   So if we radically change our work, it will radically change these issues.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.800]   We have these holes we have in our life.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:54.960]   And this is what I think was I enjoyed about you cataloging the again, the existential
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.720]   issues with a quote unquote dream style job.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.600]   A Michelin starred chef is like it's also a it's a hard job and has and you end up with
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.440]   the same sort of questions and its content of your work cannot save you from trying to
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.400]   figure out a full life that includes work and is not dominated by it.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.120]   Yeah. You know, wherever you go, there you are.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.560]   And I think that's particularly true in the work world.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:25.160]   And and I think some of these jobs that are, quote unquote, greater or dream jobs have
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:30.840]   some of the greatest problems in them because there is this sort of perceived halo effect
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:37.720]   of the privilege of being able to do the work itself that keeps people from advocating for
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.640]   what they need or or knowing their own worth.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.000]   There's this concept in the book that I talk about called vocational awe, and it was
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.160]   coined by this librarian.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.960]   But I think it's very applicable to teachers and health care workers and people in the
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   nonprofit sector, anyone whose job has a sort of social mission.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.240]   And this woman, Fobazi Itar, coined it.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.120]   She was a school librarian.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.520]   And basically the term refers to the perceived righteousness that some of these different
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.600]   fields have, you know, even fields like ours, like being able to write or being in
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:17.400]   academia. There's this sort of idea that, OK, these these fields are doing God's work
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.440]   and therefore they are beyond critique.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.640]   But, you know, as a colleague of ours and Helen Peterson says, often all that passion
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.680]   for your work will get you is the ability to get paid very little.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:35.200]   You know, people can use the sort of good brand of some of these jobs to obscure a lot
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.240]   of the exploitation and malpractice that exists within these factories.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:45.000]   You know, we saw in the education world in the same breath, people were told you're
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.120]   doing God's work and make do with what you have.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.840]   You know, there's sort of like speaking out of two sides of our mouth when we talk
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.240]   specifically about dream jobs or jobs that others might seem might think are cool or
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.640]   might think are prestigious.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.760]   They can they cannot always be as shiny as their veneer.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.800]   Yeah, I love that term, by the way.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.080]   Vocational awe, because I think you're right, especially among highly educated
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.680]   knowledge workers. That is a that's a common trap.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.480]   And then you have the flip side, which is, for example, you know, Mike Mike Rose, semi
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.000]   famous Ted talk about he's pushing back against the notion of passion and vocational
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.400]   awe. And he's talking about his time on the Discovery Discovery Channel that did the
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.240]   show Dirty Jobs that was called.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.760]   And he went on and talked about a lot of people in these maybe it was a septic tank
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.920]   cleaner, for example.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.000]   And you would say, well, the content of that job is, you know, well, in this case,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.920]   literally crap. Right.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.720]   So you're like, how could that possibly be a job that you're going to be happy in?
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.640]   And but he would say, but this person was way happier than someone that maybe had a
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.000]   job that had traditional awe, but they had well, it was well paid.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.760]   But also it was there was autonomy.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.800]   It was their own business.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.160]   They you know, they they could grow it as they wanted.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.680]   They could control their own hours.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.840]   They had a nice house at the lake because it's you know, it's actually highly skilled
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.480]   work and and in demand.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.960]   And and because there is no there's no vocational awe in septic tank cleaning.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.320]   So it's like completely expected.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.120]   Right. You say, I'm going to sort of craft how I want this business to run.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.400]   And no, I'm not going to do things on Sundays and whatever.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.720]   So I think it's a cool I think it's a good way of getting at a trap that certainly
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.680]   professors have this.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.280]   So, yeah, totally.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.480]   I mean, there's a study there's a study that I write about in the book that is pretty
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.280]   famous. And it's about this idea of job crafting.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.200]   And, you know, these two researchers study how people make meaning in different lines
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.960]   of work. And so they went to a place that you wouldn't think of as particularly
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.400]   meaningful. They were interviewing custodial workers at a hospital.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.360]   And what they found is that among these workers, people who had the exact same job
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.480]   description and daily duties, there was a huge variation in how meaningful or
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.440]   fulfilled people felt from their jobs.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.720]   And what they found was, you know, the workers roughly broke into two groups.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.400]   There was the first group who did not feel like their job was particularly high
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.920]   skill. They sort of went through the motions, didn't really interact with many
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.840]   people that they worked with, and ultimately didn't really like their jobs very
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.680]   much. And then there's a second group who, you know, thought their job was pretty
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.080]   high skill. They interacted with the patients and their colleagues.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.920]   But the most important part was workers in the second group attached their job to a
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.560]   greater mission.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.520]   They saw themselves as part of this system, that job was to heal the sick.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.960]   And by associating their work with this like larger social mission, they were able
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.640]   to, you know, get by in the more menial and routine things that exist in any line
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.520]   of work. And in some ways, this is sort of a counterpoint to the argument that we
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.600]   were just making, because we do individually have the ability to craft our
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.200]   jobs to create the meaning that we want to get to a certain extent.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:10.880]   But the risk is that when work becomes your sole source of meaning or your sole
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.080]   identity, it becomes a very narrow platform to balance on.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.480]   And as we saw in the pandemic, people were very susceptible to be being blown away
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.960]   by, you know, say, a strong gust of wind.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.480]   Yep. Well, what is, let's get prescriptive.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:33.280]   All right. So if we sort of accept this notion of what we should avoid, the
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.840]   centering of work as the main source of meaning in life, practically speaking, then
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.960]   how should we think about approaching the choice of job and then what we do once we
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.040]   have a particular job?
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:49.520]   Yeah, you know, the main thing that I advocate for in the book is to diversify your
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:55.000]   identity. So much as an investor benefits from diversifying the sources of stocks in
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.280]   their portfolio, we too benefit from diversifying the sources of meaning and
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.800]   identity in our lives.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.360]   And this is borne out in the research.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.560]   You know, research shows that people with greater what they call self-complexity,
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.480]   which just means sort of cultivated other sides of who they are, are more resilient
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.840]   in the face of change, which makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.280]   You know, if your boss says something disparaging and your work is your only source
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.560]   of self-worth, it can spill over to all the other facets of your life.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.400]   And people with more interests and hobbies and passions tend to be more creative
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.880]   problem solvers. And especially in the knowledge economy, where there isn't always a
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.400]   direct relationship between how many hours you put in and the quality of the output,
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:45.160]   that's really important to be able to have space in your day so that ideas can bounce
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.520]   off of each other so that you can synthesize all of the inputs that you're taking in.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.720]   And I know you talk about this a lot with timeboxing and thinking about ways that you
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:59.080]   can have some unstructured time in your day for your body to marinate all the things
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.880]   that are coming in. And so then the question is, how do you diversify your identity?
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.280]   And I think there's really just two steps and it's pretty straightforward, might seem
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:14.520]   simplistic, but I've been surprised by how few people actually put this into practice.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.440]   The first is just to carve out space where you're not working.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.040]   Right now, I think so many knowledge workers in particular exist in the sort of
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.920]   perpetual state of half work where they're swiping down at email to see, swiping down at
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.440]   dinner to see if new emails have come in.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.480]   And they're kind of like sharks sleeping with one eye open.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:41.720]   But one of the problems with this work centric point of view is that at the end of the
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.240]   workday, you don't have time or energy to do much else.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.360]   Esther Perel, the psychologist, has this great phrase where she says, too many people
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.560]   bring the best of themselves to work and then bring the leftovers home.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.600]   And that's always resonated with me.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.360]   And the second part is, you know, it might sound straightforward, but if you want to
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:08.040]   have other sources of meaning in your life beyond work, you have to do things other than
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:13.120]   work, not turn on Netflix or turn off your brain at the end of the day, but try and find
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.520]   ways that you can actively invest in your relationships, invest in your community,
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.680]   invest in your interests and hobbies.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.600]   You know, there's a direct relationship between the time and energy that we give to
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.120]   things and the meaning that we're able to get from them.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.240]   And, you know, identities are sort of like plants.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.440]   You know, they need time and energy to grow.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.840]   And right now, too many people are giving not only their best hours, but their best
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.320]   energy just to one thing in their life, which is their jobs.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.320]   So then how do we grapple with productivity in this context?
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:50.120]   By which I mean, there's this tension that is coming through in a lot of the writing
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.840]   about these issues right now, that to to make the space to do other things, to have the
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.240]   confidence to shut down your work and not feel that you need to check the email, that
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   you're still delivering, that you're not scrambling late at night because, oh, God,
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.760]   this thing is due and I forgot about it.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.800]   You need to really have your life, professionally speaking, organized.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.520]   Right. And this is where we would traditionally use the term like productivity
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.720]   systems. You know, you're you have capture and control and you're time blocking or
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.320]   something like this. And then there's the other valence of productivity, which is more
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.520]   of the economic metric that the maximizing of production, they're trying to produce
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.880]   more. So let's talk about that.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.400]   How do we do?
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.760]   Am I right in saying we do really need to care about the mechanics of work in order to
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:40.160]   attain work? And if that's true, how do we care about the mechanics of work without
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.240]   falling into the trap of, well, now that I can control these mechanics, why don't I
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.720]   produce more Model T's?
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.040]   How do we deal with productivity in this?
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.360]   And when we think about this framework?
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.480]   Yeah. So there's sort of like the individual or the micro scale.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.920]   And then there's the macro scale.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.800]   You know, I think a lot of the data coming out of some of these four day workweek trials
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:05.120]   is showing that productivity and hours put in are not always directly related.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.000]   You know, in some lines of work, yes.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.080]   And in many ways, this is a holdover from the industrial age where the more hours you
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.560]   spend on the assembly line, the more Model T's get produced.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:23.240]   But in a knowledge economy, when the output is more often an idea or a piece of
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:30.320]   writing or a headline for a marketing campaign, not all hours are created equal.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:36.680]   And we still live in a world that tries to impose a lot of these industrial era
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.880]   schedules onto our knowledge economy lives.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.280]   So this is something that you and others have written about a lot.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:50.080]   One of the benefits on the individual and the personal scale of being organized and
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:55.320]   planning out when you're going to do what is that it can create firmer boundaries
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.160]   around when you're not going to do the thing that is hanging over your head.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.240]   You know, I've always found that the best productivity hack is presence.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.960]   It's just your ability to unitask and do one thing at a time.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.120]   And, you know, yes, there are apps and ways to design your environment that might
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.680]   optimize for presence.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.320]   But when you boil it down at the end of the day, the best way to be productive is
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.200]   to, as you would say, do deep work is to rid yourself of some of those distractions
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.400]   and be more attuned to when you have the energy to do certain types of work
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.120]   throughout the day.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.120]   And I think that's one of the great pieces of potential of our current, you know,
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:43.000]   remote world or hybrid world is people have a lot more autonomy and agency to work on
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.200]   tasks at times that best suit their energy levels.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.960]   And so whereas, you know, work might on one moment on one task when you're feeling
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:57.080]   super low energy, expand like a gas and just take up however much space you a lot
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.520]   for it in a more intentional or, you know, autonomous world.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.000]   Maybe if you're not being very productive on what you're doing, you can put it to
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.040]   the side and, you know, go for a walk or do something more routine and mundane that
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.720]   doesn't require you to think hard or think critically about what you're doing.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.080]   Right.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:23.000]   And then schedule or slot that work in that requires you to really think deeply into a
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   time in your day when you are feeling like you're firing on all cylinders.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.920]   Well, now I'm theorizing on the fly.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   So here's my new theory based on exactly what I just heard you say that helps
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:39.960]   explain, you know, I have an uneasy relationship with the the anti productivity
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.880]   world out there.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.800]   And, you know, I put and whose work I really respect is definitely, you know, in that
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.760]   world. And sometimes we don't feel like we're talking about different things.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.480]   We're talking about productivity organization.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.400]   But here's my theory that reconciles all of that.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.480]   If you take and you're going to tell me if I'm crazy or not, if you take productivity
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:05.080]   techniques and I'm talking organizational techniques and you throw it into a life that
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:10.400]   has the work as my sense of transcendent meaning in that context, it's almost impossible
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.240]   to prevent those tools from doing anything but actually just increasing effort.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:20.720]   Because if work is my defining meaning and what I do, if I'm given the tools that
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   actually allows me to produce more with more time, I am going to produce more.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.600]   And because that's the context most people are in, there is a fair critique from the
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:34.200]   anti productivity movement of I don't even want to talk about to do list or organizational
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.240]   tools or I want to castigate that as it's all it's all productivity bros talking about
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.160]   it because they're rightly pointing out in the professional context I see around me
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.400]   that the tools is throwing dynamite onto the shaky train car.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.840]   Whereas if someone has adopted your framework already, though, and is saying, OK, I
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.640]   have a diverse identity work as part of it.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.000]   But are these other things that are important to me?
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.640]   You throw productivity tools in that context.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.600]   They say, oh, great.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.440]   This is what's going to allow me to get this done by three so I can get my bike rides in
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.520]   before the sun goes down.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.320]   It's so it's maybe it's the context dependent.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.640]   Valence of productivity is the key, this is I'm making up terms on the flags, it's what I
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:19.280]   do is the key to explaining how sort of the anti productivity crowd is touching on
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.960]   something absolutely right, but at the same time, also these types of thinking could be
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   absolutely critical to a better way of work and all of it's true at the same time.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.120]   It's not actually a contradiction.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:28.920]   It's all contextual.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.880]   I totally agree.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.560]   You know, it depends on what your North Star is.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.800]   You know, if work is the lens through which you're viewing your life, then everything can
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.200]   become grist for the mill.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.720]   You know, all your inputs are in service of your ability to create commercial output.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:54.040]   But if you take a more zoomed out picture and think about work as part of what you do,
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.560]   it's similar to budgeting with money.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.760]   You know, the goal of budgeting isn't to be pinching pennies and contemplating every
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.720]   single purchase you make.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.240]   It's actually to free yourself from having to negotiate every single decision anew.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:14.240]   And I think the good side of productivity is just that is understanding what is the ways
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.960]   in which you're going to schedule and budget your time so that you can feel free when
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:23.440]   you're off the clock to actually be off the clock and then know when you're on the clock
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.360]   what you're going to be doing with that time as well.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   And then when thinking about this framework, the other thing that comes up is this idea
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.720]   of I've written about before, like in So Good They Can't Ignore You, that often in a job,
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.120]   instrumentally speaking, skill is your best leverage.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.680]   So the better you are at something that's valuable, the more potential control you have
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.000]   over what your job is like.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.040]   If you're recognized that and willing to actually deploy it.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.000]   So now there's kind of a balancing act here, right?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.880]   We want to find a we want to find a path between quiet quitting on one side and all in
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.760]   overload on the other side, a path in which you are deliberately building up skill because
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:07.200]   it's going to give you more and more options to craft work to fit with other identities.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.920]   But that that's a kind of an ambitious pursuit.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.240]   And you don't want that to fall into into overwork.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.080]   So how do we how do we navigate?
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.240]   You know, I don't want to just give up because that's not going to end up well.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.040]   But I don't want the ambition of I'm going to get better at this new thing because it's
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.000]   going to give me two years from now the ability to now I'm going to be fully remote and
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.920]   can dictate my terms. How to not allow that to push you into back to overload.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.000]   I'm back to like, let's just this is let's keep going.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.760]   Yeah. I mean, that's the million dollar question, right?
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.480]   How do you pursue meaningful work without letting your work subsume who you are?
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.040]   And if I might, I'll offer a term, which is the good enough job.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:52.520]   You know, I think what I like about the framework is that it's intentionally subjective.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.440]   You get to choose what good enough means to you.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.000]   Maybe your version of good enough is making a certain salary or making a certain amount
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.680]   of money, or maybe it's having a certain title or working in a certain industry or
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.720]   getting off at three o'clock so you can go pick up your kids from school or go on your
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:15.960]   bike ride. But what I encourage people is to recognize when they have it, because the
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.840]   default is just more, more, more, more, more.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.760]   And that's what leads to a lot of the restlessness or the lack of fulfillment is when
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.840]   people don't know to what end they're working for.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:36.880]   I think getting very clear on your values and understanding how work can support your
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:42.400]   vision of a well-lived life can help you understand what your version of enough is.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.320]   And I think that's the key in threading that needle.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:51.280]   I do agree with you where on the side of, you know, quite quitting or, you know,
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:56.160]   nihilism, it's not necessarily a recipe for fulfillment either.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.600]   I remember you talking on a past episode about how you think a lot of this sort of
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.200]   like anti-capitalism rhetoric and anti-work rhetoric is a red herring.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:10.720]   And it's true. We live in a material world as much as we might want to deny it.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.600]   You know, right now there's a lot of cultural cachet in being against work.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.200]   But at the end of the day, everyone still has to pay rent.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:25.440]   And so just kind of chalking work up to a necessary evil, I don't think is ultimately a
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.760]   recipe for happiness either.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:32.720]   Do you have any faith or optimism about there also being systemic changes in
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:40.200]   organizations themselves that makes these type of jobs more generally sustainable?
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.360]   And I'm coming at this from, you know, my my thread of critique, the thread I'm always
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.120]   trying to throw into this conversation and sort of the thread I hold on to, and I'm
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.800]   kind of alone in this sometimes, is I, of course, as a computer scientist, take this
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.360]   technological thread looking into this, that there is this unintentional side effects of
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.440]   introducing low friction communication tools.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:05.640]   The collision of digital with knowledge work spun work habits and directions that were
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.280]   particularly unsustainable.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.360]   I mean, I like to think of it as it takes this mindset you're talking about.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.080]   Work is my meaning. More is better.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.280]   And then it was upping the marijuana to heroin, right?
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.200]   These tools then made it possible to, oh, I can now easily work all the time.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:26.000]   Right. So it it it enabled this existing mindset to really spiral out of control.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.480]   So I have this sort of technological thread is that just this haphazard approach to
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.880]   collaborating where we say, here's Slack, here's email, figure it out, has made things
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.040]   10 times worse or whatever.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:42.480]   But that also opens up the idea of, oh, so if in part things are incredibly unsustainable
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.720]   because of this techno social loop, that's not really helping anyone is making workers
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:50.640]   more miserable. People stay up till midnight checking emails is not really making, you
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:56.480]   know, sale forces revenue better because those people are distracted from whatever
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.920]   writing better code or something like that.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.880]   So do you have any optimism that even market forces and this is the late capitalism
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.320]   club, late stage capitalism really hates this idea.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.400]   And I'm not saying this is going to happen.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.600]   I'm just going to throw it out there that even market forces could potentially play a
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:15.040]   role in making work more sustainable as at some point there might be some recognition
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.480]   of we need some more structure here.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.400]   Like, this is crazy.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.720]   We can't just send emails all day long and just out of control throwing work back and
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.200]   forth like this isn't helping anyone.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.160]   So is there systemic changes that might happen that might complement the sort of
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.400]   individualized strategies you're talking about here?
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:36.880]   Yeah, I think there have to be, because right now the default is the hyperactive hive
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.600]   mind. It's everyone running around like a chicken with their head cut off trying to
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.840]   respond to a million different Slack notifications.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:49.360]   And, you know, obviously, like my disposition, I tend to lean toward the moral case as
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.320]   opposed to the business case for the value of working less or investing in other sides
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.720]   of work. But I do think there are things that companies can do.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.240]   And I think it's incumbent on companies to do them, because right now, too often the
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:07.680]   onus is placed on the individuals to find better work life balance or to practice self
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.760]   care. And I really think that companies in their own best interest have the
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.080]   responsibility to design systems that make work more, as you would say, sustainably
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.440]   productive. So some things that I've seen that I think work really well, first and
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.800]   foremost, hiring enough people so that there's enough people to do the work.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.520]   I think part of what I've noticed through my reporting is that some of these companies,
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:36.080]   there's no Slack built into their system so that when one employee takes time off, they
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:42.040]   have to be available because there aren't the right systems in place to be able to
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.360]   delegate that work to other people that work there.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:50.680]   The second is, you know, managers and bosses need to model the type of culture and
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.560]   behavior that they want their companies to have.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:58.440]   You know, I've talked to so many different leaders or CEOs that say, yeah, you know,
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.400]   we want to try and cultivate more of a healthy relationship to work here.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.120]   And, you know, of course, I'm on Slack at 11 p.m.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.760]   answering emails and my green dot is always available.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.920]   You know, culture trickles down from the top.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.600]   And if your boss is answering emails on their honeymoon in the Sahara Desert, like
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.560]   what, of course, you should be doing so, too, is the kind of implied message.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:26.520]   And then I think it's just about being more clear about expectations.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:31.560]   So there's a section in the book where I talk about a more transactional approach to
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.240]   work, which might seem crass, especially in our current culture that loves to think of
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.000]   jobs as callings and vocations and passions.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.600]   But what I mean when I think about a more transactional approach to work is just being
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.160]   clear on both sides of the equation.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.920]   What is this contract that we're entering into?
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.200]   I think it can free both employers and employees.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:59.360]   Employers can focus on defining what good work looks like and employees can know what
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:05.400]   the expectations are for success and more importantly, treat their job as part but not
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.680]   the entirety of who they are.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:12.840]   You know, I think like questions around the ability to advocate for fair compensation
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:19.240]   all come back to this idea that work is more than an economic contract.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:25.160]   But at the end of the day, fundamentally, definitionally, what a job is, is an
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.360]   exchange of a worker's time and energy for a paycheck.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.440]   I think the more clear sighted we can be about that, the better.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.400]   I'm 100 percent on board with you.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.240]   I mean, I think that idea is straight on.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:40.440]   The more you can actually surface the implicit transaction, everything gets better.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:45.040]   And then it's about I'm doing this for you in exchange for this income.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:51.480]   And maybe as the skill gets higher, the amount of income for the same amount of
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.720]   effort, maybe that goes up or whatever.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.440]   But this is what I'm doing and I did it well and I'm doing it well.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.840]   And so the fact that I'm not here at three because I'm with my kids or doing
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.440]   something else doesn't matter.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.080]   What matters is I'm delivering next month this package that I said I was going to
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:09.600]   deliver. I am a big believer in that, whether that is an explicit thing or it's
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.880]   more implicit. I've written about it.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.640]   I mean, people have tried this internally.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.920]   This is like results only work environments, tried to make that tangible inside big
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.280]   environment. And where that did work, it worked really well.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.880]   My friend Ben Kastnoka years ago wrote a book called The Alliance.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.800]   He might have co-authored that with Reid Hoffman, but it was about...
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.000]   I actually went to high school together.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.160]   Oh, you know? OK.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:30.680]   You know Ben?
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   Yeah, we're both San Francisco natives.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.040]   Yes. Oh, excellent.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.400]   Good. Well, we have a lot we could talk about.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.320]   But so you know Ben and you remember his company in high school.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.920]   But that book is proposing a future of work that hasn't quite come, but it was kind
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.800]   of a good idea that it was you might imagine a future, especially highly skilled
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.160]   workers say, I'm going to have a contract with you to do this for the next two years.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.280]   And this is what our relationship is going to be.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.600]   Is this I'm doing this work for you and I'm good at it and you're paying me well for
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.800]   it. And and you know, when we're done, we'll shake hands and I'm going to sign a
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.160]   contract somewhere else. You know what?
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.200]   And there could be more of that within all of it seems to me a pushback against the
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.800]   no, no, you're just a cognitive cog in this giant machine.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.480]   And we just want to just keep pumping as much.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.640]   You just pump out as much out of your brain as possible.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.680]   Just always be doing stuff.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.800]   The more stuff, the better.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.000]   And yeah, you have work life balance.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.600]   But remember, every time you choose life over work, you're kind of letting us down.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.160]   So you always have to deal like every moment you have to be negotiating that and that
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.600]   that sort of there's no upper limit.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.320]   We're giving it to you. We're saying, figure it out.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.080]   Just doesn't work. Yeah, it's just just misery making.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.720]   And then the pandemic, especially those of us who had kids at home to like trying to
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:40.840]   go to school. I think that was another another breaking point where it's like, you
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.680]   know, yeah, we acknowledge that, but also just still do all your work.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:51.160]   And I think some of the systems within companies are directly in opposition to the
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.600]   ability to move to this more enlightened future.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:50:01.760]   Like I'm thinking of lawyers, for example, like lawyers are forced to track their job,
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.960]   their work in like six or 15 minute increments.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:11.280]   And it's just this perverse incentive that rewards time spent working over the quality
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.680]   of the work. And I remember talking to this litigation associate in New York, and he
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:22.440]   basically told me that like I have no incentive to do work efficiently or produce high
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.600]   quality in a shorter amount of time.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:31.000]   My only incentive is to, you know, build my billable hours that are expected of me.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.640]   And for as long as we have systems like that in place, we're never going to be able to
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:43.160]   achieve the life of work life integration that so many people desperately want.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:49.720]   Yeah, like estate lawyers have figured this out, this idea of, OK, we have packages, we
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.120]   will plan your estate and here's how much it costs.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.480]   And that's the negotiation, not ours.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.640]   And I'll tell you one, I want to be respectful of your time, but I'll tell you one
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.760]   positive alternative model I came across recently here in D.C.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.880]   is there's an increasing number of law firms.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:08.480]   These are typically women run law firms because it's reacting in particular to the
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.600]   impossibilities of advancement in that model.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.360]   If, let's say, for example, you have kids and the model of these new law firms is we
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.720]   have a much lower cap of hours.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:23.160]   And they say, because you know why it we bill at a high rate and this generates a good
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:28.320]   amount of money and everyone makes a good income and we have that cap low.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:32.840]   We don't have the the unbounded upper end model of the standard big law firm of like
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.320]   the more the better. And how do you differentiate yourself?
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.280]   You outbill someone else.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:40.000]   And so these new firms are coming out and saying, our goal is not to try to, you know,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.280]   it's OK. We don't need the one point seven million dollar salary as the top equity
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.880]   partner. Actually, what if we do this social contract?
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.680]   We work 40 hour weeks.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:54.600]   We bill 30 out of those 40 and everyone's making, you know, whatever it is.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   I don't give numbers, but, you know, whatever it is, like a very healthy, like in the
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.800]   middle of the six figure salary or something like that.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.200]   And that's considered radical.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.080]   But I love that type of thinking of like, well, what are we actually trying to
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.680]   accomplish here? What if it's not just maximizing the income scorecard, you know,
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.120]   for our equity partners or something like this?
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.440]   So I like that.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.000]   I love to see that type of that type of innovation.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.880]   You know what it sounds like those lawyers know?
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.720]   They know their definition of good enough.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:27.480]   They have a sense of what they need and not just this endless desire for more.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.200]   Yeah. And if only there was a book that could teach this mindset.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.040]   Oh, there is. So we got the good enough.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.440]   Job. Let's see if I get the subtitle right from memory.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.960]   Reclaiming life from work.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.840]   Exactly. Just right.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:45.880]   All right. Well, Simone, thank you for calling in and helping giving us some some
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.520]   deep ideas here. I really recommend the book.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.480]   And again, it's very humanist.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.080]   It's it's stories into the lives of real people.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:59.840]   It's not, shall we say, Cal Newport esque of here's 17 definition terms and
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.560]   framework. So I appreciate that.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.160]   I think my readers will as well.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.120]   They get enough frameworks and new terms for me.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.000]   Absolutely. Money. Thank you for calling in.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.640]   Good enough job. Thank you.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.160]   Yeah. It's out tomorrow and you can learn more at the good enough job dot com.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.800]   Oh, yeah. I'm see.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.200]   You know what? I'm terrible at this because I'm terrible at marketing.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.720]   I have social media. Tell us.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.640]   OK, the good enough job dot com.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.640]   Is that the book website?
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.880]   That's the book website.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.400]   And socials. What should we know?
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.400]   My social media.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.760]   OK, first name, last name.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.760]   Simone Stolzoff.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.120]   Yeah. So much for having me on.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.200]   All right. Thank you.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   All right. Well, that was great.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.760]   I think we really got into some interesting wisdom there.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:42.640]   There we go. That's my my sort of virtual commencement address for the year.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:46.800]   So what I want to do next is tackle a collection of questions from you, my
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.640]   listeners, that will all be more or less roughly themed about this idea of finding
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.720]   meaning in your job, figuring out what role your job should play in your life.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   We get a lot of questions like that.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.280]   So I called I called three or four for us to tackle before we get there.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.960]   However, let me talk about one of the sponsors that makes this show possible, a
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:10.320]   sponsor that is very appropriate given the theme of today's episode, and that is
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.360]   our friends at 80,000 Hours.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:18.880]   80,000 Hours is a nonprofit that aims to help people have a positive impact with
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.240]   their career.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.160]   Now, think about this.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:28.600]   As we were just discussing with Simone, if you adopt a mindset that says my entire
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:33.240]   identity worth and happiness doesn't have to come from my job, job is just one part
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.240]   of my life, then that opens up a lot more options for what you want to do with your
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:40.800]   job. And if it's just going to be something that helps support me, it's not the end
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:45.920]   all and be all. Might as well consider making it a job that is useful to the world.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.680]   This is where 80,000 Hours comes in.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.840]   Now, let's talk about this name.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.760]   Where does that come from?
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.840]   Where does that number come from?
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.680]   It is the length of the average career.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:55:00.200]   This is 40 hours a week, times 50 weeks a year, times 40 years, gets you to 80,000
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:04.640]   hours. As the folks at 80,000 Hours like to say, that's a lot of time.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.440]   So if your job is something that is useful to the world, you'll end up putting in a lot
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.680]   of effort towards improving the world because of how much time you actually spend
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.440]   working on your job.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:19.640]   Most career advice doesn't really address social impact or how to make a positive
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.760]   difference. So 80,000 Hours is a nonprofit that is focused on exactly that goal.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.840]   They've spent the last decade conducting research along academics at Oxford
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:34.640]   University to figure out how to optimize the impact of your career on the world.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:39.720]   I have known the 80,000 Hour people since my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:43.960]   came out. I remember that they were just getting this nonprofit up and going and we
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:48.400]   shared a simpatico view that there is more of an instrumental way of understanding
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.280]   jobs as opposed to instead being our identity or the thing that's going to make us
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:56.880]   most happy. So I've known the individuals involved at 80,000 Hours for over a
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:03.080]   decade now. So what you can do is go to their website, 80,000Hours.org/deep.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.960]   That's where you'll find all of their research and guides about having a high impact
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:14.920]   career. They also have a excellent podcast where they have unusually in-depth
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.600]   conversations with experts in the world's most pressing problems.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.720]   What you can do to solve them so you get expert views on different careers that are
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.440]   useful to the world.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.120]   If you've been enjoying my discussions of AI, I would suggest checking out their
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.680]   somewhat recent interview with David Chalmers on the nature and ethics of
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.520]   consciousness. He's an expert on machine consciousness.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:39.280]   Very interesting. 80,000 Hours also has a great job board where you can find
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.960]   listings for jobs that make a difference.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.200]   They even offer free one on one career calls with their impartial advising team.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.400]   Everything they provide is free.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:53.440]   They're a nonprofit and their only aim is to help you find a high impact career.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:59.360]   So if you go to 80,000Hours.org/deep, and don't forget that slash deep, because if
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:04.160]   you go to the include the slash deep, you'll get sent a free copy of their in-depth
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.840]   career guide, which will help you learn about what makes for a high impact career,
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:12.480]   help you get ideas for choosing an impactful path and then create a plan to put
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.080]   what you found into action.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.440]   So head to 80,000Hours.org/deep.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.600]   That's the number 80,000 followed by the word hours.org/deep.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.760]   Start planning a career that is meaningful, fulfilling and help solve one of the
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.800]   world's most pressing problems.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:31.120]   I also want to talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.760]   They solve a different problem, but one you should worry about, which is your
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.240]   internet privacy.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:41.880]   When you connect to the Internet, be it through a wireless access point when you're
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.360]   out and about or through your home internet connection, people can see who you're
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.720]   talking to. If you're talking, going wirelessly to a router, they can actually sniff
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:55.080]   your packets off the public radio waves and see what websites or services is this
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.400]   person talking to.
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:01.360]   Even if you're within the privacy of your own home, talking to your private internet
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.600]   subscription with a cable company, for example, that internet service provider can
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.080]   watch who is he talking to, who is she talking to and sell that data.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:13.480]   To a data brokers, a VPN helps you get around that.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.280]   Here's the way it works. Instead of directly connecting to a site or service, you
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.760]   instead make a secure encrypted connection to a VPN server.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.120]   You then tell that server with encrypted messages, here's who I really want to talk
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.760]   to. That server talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts the response and
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.840]   sends it back to you.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.320]   People sniffing your wireless packets, your internet service provider, all they find
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.160]   out is that you're talking to a VPN server.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:39.600]   They learn nothing about your actual internet habits.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.440]   You need to use a VPN.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:45.080]   If you do use a VPN, I suggest ExpressVPN.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.280]   It is easy to use.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.480]   You turn it on and just use your website, your web browsers or services like normal.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:54.000]   They have servers in over 90 countries.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.680]   So no matter where you are, you'll you'll be able to find almost certainly a server
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.840]   that's geolocated near where you are.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.200]   They have good bandwidth.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.000]   It is just a top of the line VPN service.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.240]   So it's a no brainer.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.200]   You want to keep your internet privacy secure.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.440]   Go to ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.800]   Don't forget to use my link so you can get three extra months free.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:24.360]   That's ExpressVPN.com/deep to learn more.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:32.520]   All right, let's hear some of your questions about fitting your career into a deep life.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.840]   Jesse, who's our first question today?
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   All right, first question is from Confused.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.640]   How do I figure out what kind of job I want to do?
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.840]   I'm 42, totally confused.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.320]   I can't even I can't even go back to school as I don't know what I'm interested in.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.480]   Well, Confused, it's a good question.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.120]   It's not too late.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.600]   We are going to help you out here.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:52.440]   I'm glad you're not just defaulting to go back to school.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:57.080]   But the very fact that you brought that up to say, I don't think I can do that.
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.040]   I think that is very telling.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.680]   And I want to I just want to focus on that for just a second, because I think that
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.680]   underscores the degree to which is just expected.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.960]   If you don't know what to do.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.640]   Burn 30 or 60 thousand dollars on a degree and that'll kill time and maybe that'll
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:17.080]   open something up new that has become so expected that you felt the need to have a
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.840]   disclaimer because you expected that might be the advice you get.
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.840]   You had to disclaim it right up front so that I want to you want to hear that advice
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840]   because it wasn't going to work for you.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.320]   That shows how ubiquitous that idea has become.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.920]   As longtime listeners know, I do not think randomly going to school is a great idea
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   for graduate degrees.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:37.760]   I do not think you should use it as a time killer or use it speculatively.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.440]   Hey, I have to imagine if I get this degree, interesting jobs will arise.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.480]   My theory about grad degrees, which I talk about every couple of months here on the
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:55.120]   show, is you should get a graduate degree when the specific path you're on, you get
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.320]   to a block in that career path that says this degree from this school allows me to
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.800]   move forward to this next step on the career path.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:06.680]   And I really want to go there when you have a specific reason to get the degree and
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.600]   trusted evidence that the degree you're getting from the place you're getting it
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.080]   will take you to that next location.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.560]   So degrees should be deployed for very specific reasons, not as a speculative
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.840]   investment in opportunities that are yet undiscovered.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.440]   It's like me going to get a Ph.D.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.000]   That was very clearly on the step to becoming a professor.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.200]   But I really want to become a professor.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.680]   So there's a really clear reason why I did that.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:34.920]   All right.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.960]   So we put school out of the way.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.920]   What should you do?
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.760]   You're not going to be surprised you're confused.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.680]   My listeners aren't gonna be surprised here either.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.920]   When I say lifestyle centric career planning, when I hear how do I figure out
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.640]   what type of job I want to do, I'm totally confused.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.040]   I would say that question is the wrong one.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.880]   What job do I want to do?
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.920]   What does that mean that you want to do the job because it's going to
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.680]   mat some innate passion, because it is going to make you happy every day,
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.640]   because you're going to feel an unshakable drive and motivation and happiness to
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.800]   work. That doesn't mean anything to me.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.280]   What does it mean to want to do a job?
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.840]   I think that is too vague.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.760]   I think you're probably putting, as we talked about with Simone earlier, you are
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:24.880]   probably putting way too much emphasis on the job must be fulfilling some
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.360]   fundamental need I have.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.280]   Lifestyle centric career planning is a great way to flip that around.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.600]   What you're aiming towards is a fully featured vision of your lifestyle, not
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.600]   just your what type of work you're doing, but where you're living, what your day
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.640]   is like, what your time is like.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.080]   Is it heavily scheduled or open?
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.560]   Are you in the woods or in the city?
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:51.080]   Are you reading first edition Faulkner by a creek somewhere in the woods or
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:56.320]   checking out the latest post-punk band in an underground club in the Lower East
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.080]   Side? You just have these clear visions of what resonates, what lifestyle resonates,
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.440]   what are the different elements of that lifestyle?
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.960]   And then you say, great, how do I work backwards from that to achieve those
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.400]   elements? And what you then start looking for is decisions in your life that move
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.920]   you as far forward as possible towards that vision.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.520]   Your job will be a huge part of that vision, but now you're deploying your job
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.360]   towards something specific, not answering the question, what do I want to do?
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:29.040]   But instead answering the question, what is the right package of decisions that
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.840]   will move me closest to this vision that I have articulated?
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.160]   It's a pragmatic problem.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.560]   It is a practical problem.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.600]   The job becomes, in the same way that Simone talked about, quite instrumental.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.800]   So you're 42, right?
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:47.560]   So we're not 22, where you might be more prone to thinking my job is going to be
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.280]   everything. And at 22, by the way, you probably have no idea really what you want
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.360]   in your lifestyle anyways.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.520]   You have self-reflection, now you have self-awareness, you have quite a bit of
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.560]   experience as an adult.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.720]   So you can form, I think, a realistic, pragmatic lifestyle that really does
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.160]   resonate. And then you just get tactical.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:11.040]   All right, well, this lifestyle is really built around, I don't know, autonomy and
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.760]   being outside in the country.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.000]   So, OK, it's got to be remote work.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.600]   Maybe if I live cheaper, that will then open up the salary range that would work for
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.160]   me. I know I don't like this type of effort.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.960]   So let me look at this category of jobs.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:32.760]   And what I think about, I'm confused, I have a very specific example in mind.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.720]   I remember meeting someone up in Vermont when we were there last summer who had some
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:43.680]   job for the state government in Burlington and skied every day on the way to or from
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.560]   work. They lived in between him and his work was a ski hill.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.000]   A lot of what he did, he could go out, he had to go and do surveying in the woods.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.600]   And so there's lots of sort of being outside.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.720]   And the job was like fine.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.560]   But it was like what he was building was this great Vermont lifestyle.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:01.160]   The job was so weird and specific and government specific.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160]   There's no way that he sat down and said, what do I want to do?
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.880]   Well, I want to have this particular position in this bureaucracy in the Vermont
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.240]   state government. No, no. He had a lifestyle vision.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.680]   And it involved living in a place like Vermont and having this flexibility and these
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.920]   engagement with the outside.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.520]   And then he went and as part of putting together that picture, found this job that made
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.840]   that work. It was a good enough job to use Simone's term.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.440]   All right. So lifestyle, career planning confused and don't go get a random graduate
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.520]   degree. All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.240]   All right, next question is from M.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.480]   What advice would you give somebody who is currently in a role that meets every job
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.360]   satisfaction criteria but is struggling with motivation?
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:44.160]   I consistently lack motivation to do deep work and have to force myself to focus.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.880]   This at times feels almost physically impossible, especially when working from home
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.680]   and leads me to cycling between burnout, stress, boredom and guilt.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:58.040]   Well, and this is common, especially right now, especially post pandemic.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:03.760]   There's two potential forces that might be at play here
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.240]   that is causing this a motivation issue.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.240]   I don't know which of these that play.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.800]   It's likely that both are maybe at play and they're mixed together.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.240]   But let's talk about both separately.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.560]   The first is what I call deep procrastination, which is an issue I wrote
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.440]   about originally back when I focused my blog just on students because it was in the
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.480]   student population that I first observed this issue.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:30.680]   Deep procrastination is where you find yourself unable to work up the motivation to do
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.880]   work that needs to be done.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.640]   And for students, it'll be a paper that has to be submitted or a take home exam that has
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.520]   to go back and they just can't do it.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:43.320]   They cannot muster the internal motivation to even get started.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.400]   Deadlines will be passed.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.960]   Professors will give them extensions.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.480]   Oftentimes they maybe end up even having to withdraw from that semester.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.440]   They just can't push themselves to work.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.760]   So I observed this when I was especially at MIT, where I was at the time among high
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:03.000]   achieving students. It was different than depression because in other aspects of their
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.800]   life, they were not a hedonic.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.560]   So it wasn't an overall flattening of their ability to have sort of excitement or hope
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.680]   or positive feelings.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.600]   There's other things are still very exciting to them, but they couldn't do schoolwork.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.400]   So deep procrastination could be at play here.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.480]   I'll talk in a second about how to service that, but let me let me mention the other
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:28.120]   possible force at play here, which would be the idea that your mind might be dopamine
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:32.840]   sick. So dopamine sick is where you have.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.440]   So frazzled your brain.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:42.480]   With constant targeted distraction at the slightest hint of boredom delivered through
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.680]   your phone, delivered to your computer screen, that is now unable to work up the proper
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:52.920]   motivation to do something that's longer form, deeper and more complicated, that is so
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:58.560]   frazzled from just being stimuli bombarded with all of these algorithmically expertly
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:05.720]   aimed sources of stimuli, these digital darts right to the base of your brainstem that
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:10.120]   give you that metaphorical electrical charge that when it comes time to do something
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.280]   that is comparably more stayed, that's comparably more boring, like let's start
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.200]   gathering sources and writing this memo.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.160]   Your brain just can't do it.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.360]   And there's been a uptick anecdotally, an uptick in dopamine sickness, especially
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:31.520]   post-pandemic because of how much and how many people fell into a pattern of much more
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.200]   hyperactive exposure to distraction that they would have before.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.320]   Because maybe they're now at home and they're working remotely so they can have the
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:42.160]   phone out and things feel more haphazard.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.040]   Maybe also there is an escape was happening.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.680]   You're anxious about things that are happening in the world and you can't confront
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.200]   them. And so let me just look at the phone.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.520]   Let me just look at these these distractions and get that numbing in the moment.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.960]   So I think we have a lot more dopamine sickness than we had before.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.760]   Students are getting this very strongly because they got so embedded with their devices
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.920]   that now their brains are struggling.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.840]   When you say here's a senior thesis you have to write as a high school student and their
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.320]   brain is tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:20.160]   How can I go from seven seconds before I swipe to spending hours trying to research
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.480]   Charles DeGreat or something like this?
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.880]   So both of these things might be a play.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.560]   Deep procrastination, dopamine sickness.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.640]   Let's talk about solutions to both.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.480]   And you can mix and match these solutions as they seem to fit.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.080]   So what I learned about deep procrastination is that its source tends to be a
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:44.600]   combination of the locus of control and motivation being away from the internal and more
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.720]   towards the external.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.280]   So extrinsic motivation.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:51.360]   You're like, I don't really this feels arbitrary to me or it's not something I really want
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.120]   to do. But it's being for a student, it might be, I don't know, my parents wanted me to be
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.120]   a pre-med major and this chemistry class is really hard.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.360]   I never even wanted to be a doctor.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.240]   And this class is not something I went after because I was excited about it.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.560]   And in work, it could be I don't even understand why I'm writing this self-assessment
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.000]   report. So I just put it on my plate.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.240]   No one's even going to read this thing.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.680]   So you have this lack of intrinsic motivation for the work, coupled with the work being
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.280]   hard. So the chem class is really hard and I never want to be a doctor in the first
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.640]   place. This report is going to be a real pain.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.920]   I don't even really know.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.360]   There's a lot of ambiguities around how do I even do this?
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.640]   And I wasn't my idea to do this in the first place.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.560]   No one's really going to read it.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.320]   That combination can trigger.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.200]   Deep procrastination. So a couple of things you can do here.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:41.480]   One, you have to reduce the hardness that does help lock it in your organizational
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.800]   system. Here is how I keep track of what's on my plate.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.680]   Here's how I plan my time during the day.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:51.600]   Maybe I'm doing capture, configure, control style system of professional workplace
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.240]   management. I have processes in place for common collaborations.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.040]   There's a sense your brain gets of I am in control of how I approach my work that
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:06.560]   gives it more confidence and reduces the sense of this is some ambiguous, hard,
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:11.160]   impossible task. So when the hard thing gets reduced to time blocks that show up in
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.760]   time block plans for the days and you sort of execute your time blocks for the days,
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.640]   it's not as hard to execute.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.680]   So that can help.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.640]   Simplifying obligations also helps.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.000]   So there's a sense of hardness that sometimes come here from just you're overwhelmed,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.320]   you're overloaded and your brain says this is enough.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.640]   Like, I don't even know what all this stuff is.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.840]   This is impossible, uncle.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.320]   I'm going to do deep procrastination.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.360]   So it's a good time because it's a serious problem.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.160]   And we're not able to to just get normal work done.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.160]   It's causing you real subjective distress.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.800]   You have to be ready to make some actual big changes here and a real simplification on
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.840]   what's on your plate, even if it ruffles some feathers, may be what you need here.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.560]   Makes your workload seem manageable or possible to your mind.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.520]   And then finally, I think you need some sort of target that your professional life is
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.040]   serving. This goes back to something like lifestyle centric career planning.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.120]   So here's the chain of influence I want here.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.480]   I want you to have this vision you're excited about for your life that you're not
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.280]   there yet, but a lifestyle that's different, that resonates.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.680]   There's some things I need to change.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.080]   You need to figure out how your work fits into there.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.480]   And this may require some changes, I need to shift over from this work to that work
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.800]   or change my change, my focus within the organization, because that's going to open up
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.800]   these options, which lets me get closer to my lifestyle.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:31.480]   But what you're trying to get here is a chain of influence from a motivating image of a
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.320]   desired lifestyle and have that chain of influence come all the way back to the work
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.160]   you're doing right now. And it seems like that's arbitrary, but for the motivational
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.040]   sensors in our brain, that makes a big difference.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.760]   Now you get intrinsic motivation.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:49.000]   This self-assessment report is going to be a pain to write, but it's part of my plan
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.600]   to get this next promotion, which I'll then negotiate to shift over to this type of work,
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.160]   which I'll negotiate to do remotely.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:01.440]   And then I'm going to move to the upper peninsula of Michigan as my plan all
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.520]   specifies I should do.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.040]   Now the hard, hard effort deployed towards a goal you believe in is not, not hard.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.160]   It's not going to cause deep procrastination.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.200]   We appreciate hard things if we know why we're doing them.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.000]   So you have to, you have to fit a why in there.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.280]   If you're just going through your job, this should be a good job.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.560]   I'm paid well, it's satisfying.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.920]   I like the people, but it's just a job.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.040]   Then doing the effort could fall into this deep procrastination trap.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.480]   So you have to connect it to a bigger positive vision.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.360]   All right.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.560]   So what about dopamine sickness?
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.680]   If that is the issue here?
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.280]   Well, you need boredom therapy.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.960]   I talk about this in my book, deep work.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:37.560]   This means a regular periods throughout your day where your mind craves distractions and
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.680]   you do not give those distractions to your mind.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.160]   This includes, for example, going on at least one walk or errand a day without your
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:45.600]   phone.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.640]   So you have no option of looking at your phone or listening to something.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.400]   I would also suggest the phone for your method.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.840]   My phone gets plugged in by the front door in the kitchen.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.680]   When I get home, if I need to look something up or check text messages, I have to walk
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.760]   over there and read it there.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.640]   It is not with me on the couch.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.280]   It is not with me at the dinner table.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:05.880]   God forbid.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.160]   It's not with me in the bathroom.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.320]   So you still have the phone in your apartment, in your house.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.480]   You still have the conveniences of, Oh, I need to look up what time this thing is
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.200]   tomorrow or text someone on meeting later, but it's not on your person.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.080]   And that makes all the difference.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.000]   So now your brain is getting used to this idea.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.440]   Sometimes we get distraction when we're bored.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.920]   Sometimes we don't.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.480]   And this is a withdrawal period.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.720]   Give that a couple of weeks and your brain will get much more comfortable with it.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.800]   You can also do interval training with your ability to concentrate on hard things.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.440]   Let me just do 20 minutes.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.800]   20 minutes with a timer.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.360]   And if I break and check email or my phone, I have to reset the timer.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.640]   Your brain says that I can do.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.400]   I might freeze when you say, right, this thing is going to take five hours, but 20
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.800]   minutes I can do, and you start with that 20 minutes with a timer, intensely
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.760]   working on things until you can do that pretty regularly without it being too
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.280]   horrified.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.480]   20 minutes doesn't seem too bad.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.520]   And then you add 10 more minutes.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.480]   And then once 30 minutes becomes comfortable, you add 10 more minutes.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.640]   So you might literally need to retrain your brain for longer and longer intervals
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.760]   of focus as you escape dopamine sickness.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.560]   Finally, I think you need to care about location.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.760]   You need to care about rituals for your work.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:23.680]   So you mentioned that working from home is a big part of work seeming very hard for
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.800]   you to get started with.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.160]   This is a tricky thing.
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.440]   When your home environment, your work environment is the same.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.960]   You're trying to wrench your mind from a domestic context into a professional
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.400]   context.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.520]   It's hard to do.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.920]   Your mind is still largely ensnared in the domestic context.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.360]   It's hard.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.120]   Therefore, you don't have as much resources to actually focus on the thing ahead.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.120]   It messes with your motivational sensor senses.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.800]   So, Em, I would say go radical here.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.680]   You need a really different location.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:57.080]   You do your work, renovate the garden shed, rent some office space in a small town,
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:57.960]   spend money on this.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.040]   You have a big problem.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.120]   And you're unable to get work started.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.920]   So you have to see this as an issue that might require big solutions and build much
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.600]   more elaborate rituals around your work.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.520]   This is my work day.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.640]   I have a big walk I do to get coffee where I think I plan my day at the coffee shop.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.320]   And when I get back to my desk and my exotic location near my house, I immediately
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.200]   start working at the end of the day.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:22.320]   I go to that same coffee shop and do a shutdown routine and then do another walk
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.200]   to switch my mindset.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.360]   You need radical rituals.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.720]   You need radical locations to help your mind separate work from non-work to help
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.920]   your mind more automatically generate the motivation it needs to get going.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.040]   You're not just forcing it, white knuckling it.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.840]   Hey, let me just put this laundry basket down, walk past my kid over here who's
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.960]   homesick and just say, concentrate now.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.600]   And you're staring at the computer amidst all of that chaos.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.480]   So I don't know if you have deep procrastination.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.760]   I don't know if you have dopamine sickness.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:54.360]   I don't know if it's some mix of those two things, but think about those solutions
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.480]   and the types of solutions that seem to resonate with you.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.600]   Go with those.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.480]   That'll probably point you towards what the real problem actually is.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.400]   Did you go over the term dopamine sickness?
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.400]   Uh, I think so.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.280]   Yeah, I think you did.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.080]   I mean, it might be around.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.200]   I just made it up, but I like it.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.240]   It's, um, you come up with a lot of terms.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:12.960]   I like terms.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.280]   Well, there's a show about the opioid crisis called dope sick.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.160]   Either is.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:18.480]   Yes.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.920]   That's probably what that's probably what I'm implicitly playing off of.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.720]   Uh, I do, I do come up with a lot of terms.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.080]   All right, let's do another question.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:26.880]   All right.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.120]   Next question is from Will.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.600]   I'm having a hard time finding an academic position in a location.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.800]   That's good for my family.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.000]   I received a suggestion that I should be more flexible and exploring
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   other jobs outside academia, but I'm hesitant because I'm afraid of landing
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   in a job that's not my cup of tea.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.480]   It also feels like a waste of career capital.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.440]   I'd like to ask your suggestion on how to apply lifestyle, career
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.520]   centered planning, career capital, and other principles you teach in this context.
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.360]   Well, yeah, well, I mean, academia is rough.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.680]   Let's, let's start with that.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.840]   Academia can mean different things.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.920]   So we should be clear about what it is.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.280]   What is the target lifestyle you're looking for in academia?
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.000]   What do you have in mind?
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.240]   You have in mind a sort of one, one R1 tenure track research type professorship.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.280]   This would be that the classical in the U S system, the
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.720]   classical notion of professorship.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.560]   So one, one means you teach one course in the fall and one course in the
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.440]   spring that most of your focus is on research and tenure track, meaning
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.120]   that you're, you're in a position where your goal is to get tenure in the
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.200]   position based off your research contributions, when you think about
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.920]   famous professors, this is what they are.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.800]   One, one, usually at R1 research universities on the tenure track.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.320]   There's another thing.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:44.400]   Academia could mean academia could mean a tenure track position, but at a two,
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.280]   two or three, three at a more of a teaching focused institution where you.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:54.160]   Will produce research like a book every now and then, but not at the same expected
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.360]   rate or quality as someone at a research institution where you have a lot more
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.280]   time and that's a different type of feel.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.520]   And there it's often more about the, the academic community, the school, the
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.520]   grounds, the tradition, the pedagogy.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.080]   And then there's another trance that academia could mean, which
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.040]   is sort of non-tenure track.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.240]   Typically the money's not great.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.200]   It's a, it's a lot of teaching more adjunct style.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.720]   And that's a, that's a different option.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.080]   These are sort of all three options you get if you're coming out
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.800]   of an academic focused PhD.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.960]   So first of all, be clear, which of these you're looking for.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:33.720]   You know, which of these you are happy with and, and for the and each of them
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:40.400]   can be made into a, a component of very deep life, each of these can also be.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.800]   Poisonous to a deep life, depending on what you're really going for
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.040]   and how you actually approach it.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.200]   Once you know what you're looking for, will, then you got to be
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.320]   realistic, is that accessible to me?
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.000]   And this is where academia is rough.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   That's what I mean by it's tough.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.520]   That, that first tranche of jobs, the, the one, one tenure track at a research
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.640]   institution, those are very hard.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:05.680]   And you have to be coming out of essentially a top program a top PhD
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.600]   program with a good research track record.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.720]   And people will then assume if I hire this person, they're going to be able to do
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.160]   similar types of research when they come here.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.040]   If you, if you're not coming out of a top program with the top research record,
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.600]   those are very hard positions to get.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.800]   And that's, you will know that right now, if you're in that position or not, these
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:29.000]   are not jobs that you typically work your way into later, you don't work your way up
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.920]   to these jobs, you typically fall down into them.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.520]   So you, you're at a very good institution and then you can get one of these
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.640]   jobs at a good institution.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.600]   Right.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.280]   So you would know right now, if that's on, on the table, same thing that these
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.120]   elite teaching institutions are, are hard.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.400]   And you know, you get a sense right away at the job market is, is my combination
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.840]   of, of experience, what they're looking for or not.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:50.520]   The adjunct positions are more available, but you got to be very careful that you
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:55.200]   have a clear lifestyle vision for what you want to do with those adjunct
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.760]   positions and not trick yourself, for example, into thinking, well, if I just
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:02.160]   do that long enough, I'll be able to then jump up into one of these other categories.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.960]   It, it tends to be more of a separate track.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.200]   So we got to start with a reality check.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.640]   I don't know what the answer is because I don't know your circumstances will, but I
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.800]   think you need to face that reality check.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.440]   Even if in the end, you don't like the answer.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.560]   Even if you say I've spent so much time on this academic path, but the, the
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.880]   tranche of academia I want, honestly, is not accessible to me.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:25.680]   That can be frustrating, but we have to face that, that career reality, right in
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.240]   the face.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:34.400]   So if you find out academia is not possible or not plausible for me, I think
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.600]   lifestyle centric career planning is the right frame.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.240]   I think lifestyle centric career planning will integrate career capital theory.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.280]   So here's what I mean by that.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.800]   So we've talked about lifestyle centric career planning already on this episode,
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:53.320]   but work out the full lifestyle, your family, where you want to live, what you
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.520]   want your time to be like, other things, community involvements, philosophical,
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.280]   theological involvements, different aspects of your life and say, great.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.360]   Now we need a package of decisions that gets us as close as possible to that
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.120]   lifestyle, and that's going to involve jobs.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.560]   But now you're looking for jobs that are getting you closer to the lifestyle that
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.760]   you desire, not some sort of intrinsic fulfillment that it gives you.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:17.400]   Career capital is just at this point, a factor in this decision.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.000]   So the career capital you have by getting the, this graduate degree is just an
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.760]   opener up of options.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.640]   It puts on the table options that otherwise would not be on the table
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.880]   without the career capital.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.560]   Those options are probably better than options that don't at all take advantage
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.640]   of the training that you got in your academic path, but it doesn't mean
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.440]   necessarily those are the options you're going to go with.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.520]   I mean, you might find for this lifestyle vision we have, there's this completely
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.560]   sort of unrelated job.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:51.920]   It just cares that I'm a smart college graduate, but we could really build that
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.760]   lifestyle around it.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.160]   That might actually be the right thing.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.840]   Maybe when you're looking at the options that are specific to your specific
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:01.120]   academic training, yeah, these are higher level options or interesting options, but
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.440]   none of them fit with the lifestyle you have.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.080]   So this is how I would put career capital in there.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:08.040]   It opens up more options for you to consider, but your goal is not just the
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.760]   maximization of career capital.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:13.240]   How do I make sure I'm taking as much advantage as possible of my existing
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:13.720]   training?
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.280]   Your goal is to get as close as possible to your ideal lifestyle.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.480]   You have a lot of career capital.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:22.440]   You have a lot more options about how to do it, but it doesn't mean that the path
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:27.360]   you end up taking needs to involve you leveraging very specific skills that you
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:27.640]   bought.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:33.720]   And I recognize that it's annoying if you end up taking a path that did not
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.800]   directly pull from your training.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.360]   It does feel like a loss, but it's not.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.560]   A lot of people do that.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.000]   That's not uncommon.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.680]   People take big swerves.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.360]   That's not the issue.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:49.000]   I'm not typically worried about someone making a big swerve if the reason why
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.480]   they're swerving is they know where they want to head and there's an obstacle in
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:53.800]   the way.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.360]   And so they're swerving to get around that obstacle so they can stay on the path
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.480]   towards what they're heading towards.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.480]   So if you know what you're doing, if you're intentional about your life and you
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.080]   end up having to do a big swerve, then you end up having to do a big swerve.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.480]   I'm not worried about that.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.760]   If you know where you're heading, I worry about it.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.400]   As I talked about in So Good They Can't Ignore You, if you're swerving for the
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.080]   sake of swerving, if you're serving, serving, swerving, because you think just
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.480]   doing something radically different maybe will make your situation feel radically
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:18.960]   better.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:25.880]   If you're swerving to chase after a elusive happiness delivered from just the
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:29.600]   details of a particular job, then I get a little bit more worried.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.920]   I tell a lot of those tales on So Good They Can't Ignore You where people try to
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:37.400]   fix a fundamental emptiness in their life by radically changing their job.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.320]   And the spoiler is it doesn't.
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.160]   But a radical change that is intentional, not because you think change is good, but
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.040]   because you're trying to get closer to that destination on the horizon and
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.520]   there's a ravine in front of you.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.720]   Not a big deal.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.480]   So I wouldn't worry about it will as much as you are.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:59.280]   Just stay clearheaded and intentional.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.040]   All right, let's see here.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.360]   Let's do, I think we'll do one more question.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.080]   We'll do four instead of five today, Jesse, because we had a bit of a longer
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.440]   deep dive, but let's do one more question.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.760]   Sounds good.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.640]   Next question is from Jenny T.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.000]   My last job did not support any type of deep work.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.120]   Quick examples.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:21.920]   I watched colleagues and my team place their IMs on do not disturb and then get
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.520]   in trouble from higher ups when they didn't respond within 10 minutes and would
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.720]   then bombard them with emails and phone calls.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.320]   My superior would frequently take two meetings at one time.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.520]   Yes, you read that right.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.520]   He would listen to one meeting with earbuds and another one coming through
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.000]   the computer, I'm considering taking an old job at half the pay and no hope for
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.920]   advancement so I can stay far away from this type of culture.
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.200]   Is this crazy?
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.880]   It'd be funny if it turned out that Jesse had sent this.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.440]   This was Jesse's question.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.640]   He had just done it under a pseudonym.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:56.200]   I'm just like, if I don't, if I put my IM and do not disturb, Cal is emailing
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.280]   and calling me, taking two meetings at once.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.160]   So Jenny, let's put aside this idea about whether you should, you have to take a
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.440]   job at half pay or not to get to what I think is the fundamental point here, which
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.640]   is the environment that you describe.
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:16.000]   A hyperactive hive mind environment pushed to the extreme is a massive problem.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.720]   And we need to enable people to see that type of culture as a big issue.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.120]   The same way you might see a workplace that is not safe.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:33.040]   You know, these mill gears are crushing people's hands.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:39.360]   The same way you would see a workplace where you feel that you are harassed or
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.680]   disrespected because of who you are.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.480]   We're used to those two things as saying, oh, this is a huge issue.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.680]   I mean, yes, of course.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.520]   There shouldn't be work cultures like this, and it's an absolutely
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.720]   good reason to avoid a place.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.920]   I think we should add extreme hyperactive hive minds to this list
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.720]   of giant workplace red flags.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.040]   I get into this in my book, a world without email.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:09.680]   The context shifting torture, essentially, this induces on our brain when you're
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.960]   constantly having to service everything all the time, the constant stress of maybe
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.080]   someone needs something from me and I haven't given it to them.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.280]   There's a boss who sent me an email and I don't know it.
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:24.880]   That constant stress and anxiety that plays upon our social circuits in a sort
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:30.160]   of sadistic insidious way is then coupled with the mental fatigue and cognitive
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:33.040]   crazy making of having to keep switching your context back and forth.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.560]   You're never actually able to get any work done.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:42.320]   It's like the, the actual torture methods that, uh, I think even our own country
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.160]   deployed of not letting someone sleep.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.200]   You just keep putting on loud music every time they're about to fall asleep.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.760]   It's a kind of a cognitive equivalent.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.480]   I can never actually let my mind settle and actually focus on something.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.200]   It's a big deal.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:58.640]   It is subjectively and physiologically bad for you.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:27:59.920]   You're going to feel bad.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.000]   It's going to make you unhealthy.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.320]   It's not a, not a healthy work environment.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.840]   So what I'm, what I want to validate here, Jenny is yeah, get out of there
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.800]   and don't feel guilty about it.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:13.440]   Just like you're not going to feel guilty about, Hey, the ceiling kind of collapses
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.600]   every once in a while and people get piled in rubble or, you know, these people
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.120]   are really disrespectful or they're harassing me.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.120]   There's a complete culture of disregard.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.160]   You're like, yeah, I'm going to get out of there.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:26.760]   Feel the same way about a extreme hyperactive hive mind workflow, especially
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.680]   if that really clashes with, with what you like, I want it immediately though.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.320]   Just say.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.840]   My only option is to cut my pay in half and go back to an old
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.440]   job with no hope for advancement.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.600]   I think we can be a little bit more broad and expansive about this.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.000]   I think you can look at your career capital.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.240]   What are my skills?
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.600]   Okay.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:48.800]   And what are my options for deploying these skills in other places that maybe
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.040]   have a better version of this culture?
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.400]   I, I think most places don't necessarily have a culture this extreme.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:59.960]   And so there might just be a lateral jump lateral in terms of
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.480]   salary and job responsibilities.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:07.240]   But forward a jump way forward when it comes to the subjective enjoyment of
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:11.840]   the actual work by just going to a similar job in another place, there might be also,
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.400]   as you mentioned, another jump towards a different structure of work that
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.720]   for sure will free you from that.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.920]   I'm moving towards freelance and moving towards consulting.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.760]   I'm moving towards a relationship where it's accountability based
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.920]   and not accessibility based.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.640]   And that might not be a bad idea that, that guarantees you that you're
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.720]   not going to have those issues, but it also could be more risky.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:35.120]   And I essentially, what I'm trying to say here is don't believe that any job, like
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.600]   the one you have now is going to have that bad culture, a lot of places don't.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.000]   And so you don't necessarily have to make an extreme change to get away from that,
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.680]   but you do, you do need to get away from this particular job.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.400]   It's not working for you.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.840]   It's not working for most people as well.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.880]   So anyways, that's, that's the bigger point I want to make here is to
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:57.760]   validate people who feel that the hyperactive hive mind hum of their
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:01.920]   company or their team is a real source of negativity in your life.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:02.400]   It is.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.280]   And I validate that.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:08.560]   And it's a, a completely reasonable justification for making major changes.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.520]   All right.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.360]   So what I like to do at the end of the show is switch gears to talk about
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.840]   something interesting that you, my listeners have sent in first.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.560]   I want to mention a, another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:26.080]   This show is sponsored by better help.
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:32.120]   It's easy to get caught up in what everyone else needs from you, including,
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:36.440]   for example, like we just talked about in that last question, the boss that
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.440]   always wants a response, the colleagues that always need you to come to their
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.960]   thing, or to give them the information they need or to help them solve
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:42.880]   the problems that they have.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.640]   It's easy to get caught up in that and what everyone else needs for you.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.720]   And in doing so never take a moment to think about what you need from yourself.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:57.120]   How is your own mental life doing in the moment?
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.720]   Is it sustainable?
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.840]   Or do you find yourself racked with anxiety?
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:04.760]   Do you find yourself racked with occasional senses of hopelessness?
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.720]   How is your mind actually doing?
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:15.040]   I think this issue is increasingly relevant and urgent in a professional
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.880]   world like knowledge work, where so much of your life occurs cognitively.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.760]   That so much of it is thinking and writing and communicating and
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:25.720]   thinking and writing, and it's not mechanistic, it's not, I plowed
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:29.760]   this field now it's plowed when our work becomes all about the life of the mind.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:36.200]   We open up our mind to all sorts of different potential deviations from
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.800]   what we find to be sustainable, what we find to be healthy.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.680]   So what helps you here is going to be therapy.
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:46.280]   Just like if your leg hurts, you're going to see a leg doctor.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:50.400]   If your mind is not where you want it to be, you'll see a mind doctor.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.720]   What we would call a therapist.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.960]   The hard part of course, is finding a therapist.
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.440]   They're in demand.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.840]   Uh, it's awkward.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:01.000]   What if you don't like the therapist, you go to their office, how
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.400]   do you get out of that relationship?
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:05.440]   This is where something like better help.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.560]   Enters the picture.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.840]   Better help is entirely online.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.560]   It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.040]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist,
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:21.960]   and you can switch therapist at any time for no additional charge.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:27.360]   So the barrier to entry in terms of logistics and price is greatly lowered.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:30.880]   For getting therapy involved in your life when you use better help.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:37.280]   So find more balance with better help, visit better help.com.

[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:58.360]   The other thing I want to mention here is life insurance and in particular,
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:04.640]   our longtime sponsor ladder life insurance is one of these things for many people.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.840]   They know they need because they have loved ones who depend on them.
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:12.400]   And if God forbid something happened to them, they want to see
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.040]   their loved ones taken care of.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:17.600]   So given that importance, why do people procrastinate on it?
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.040]   Because they don't know where to start.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.760]   How do you find insurance?
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:27.000]   Is there a storefront somewhere you show up at and there's people wearing red
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.320]   polo shirts or something, and you fill out a form like the, the idea that you
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:33.640]   don't know how to start, I think more than anything else keeps people away
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.800]   from life insurance while this is where ladder enters the scene.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.240]   It's 100% digital.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:43.640]   There's no doctors, needles, or paperwork involved when you're applying for $3
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:46.280]   million in coverage or less, you just answer a few questions about
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.560]   your health in an application.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:51.760]   You need just a few minutes with a phone or laptop to apply their smart
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.120]   algorithms and work in real time.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:59.080]   And you'll find out instantly if you are approved, no hidden fees, cancel
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.920]   anytime, get a full refund.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.160]   If you change your mind in the first 30 days, ladder policies are issued by
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:09.000]   insurers with long proven histories of paying claims, they're rated A and A plus
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.280]   by A and best ladder customers themselves rate the service 4.8 out of five stars
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:20.360]   on trust pilots, and they've made Forbes best life insurance list in recent years.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:24.320]   Because life insurance is only going to get more and more expensive as you get
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.560]   older, the right time to get life insurance is always as soon as possible.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:34.720]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today to see if you're instantly approved.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:42.840]   That's L A D D E R life.com/deep ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:46.960]   All right, Jesse, let's switch gears to talk about something interesting.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.560]   This is where I take an email that you and my listeners have sent to my
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.680]   interesting@calnewport.com email address.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.800]   And I find something that caught my attention and we talk about it.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:02.720]   Today, I want to look at an article that was published on May 12th
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.360]   in the wall street journal.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:09.000]   Now, if you're watching this, you can see the article on the screen.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.080]   If you want to watch this is episode.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:12.480]   What do we have?
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:19.120]   Jesse two 49 episode two 49@youtube.com/calnewportmedia or episode
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.200]   two 49@thedeeplife.com.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.200]   I will of course narrate what I'm reading as well.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.960]   If you're just listening, all right, here's the article.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:27.640]   It's I'm going to warn everyone.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:31.400]   We're going to temporarily return to tech nerd territory, but
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.320]   we won't stay there long.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.920]   Uh, here's the article.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.600]   Apple is breaking its own rules with a new headset.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:44.760]   Apple soon to be revealed mixed reality device will likely cost $3,000.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:47.840]   Requires a separate battery pack and is still experimental.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.000]   Jesse, I'll show you a picture of this mixed reality headset.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.360]   That's not it.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.240]   That's Oculus.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.640]   That's magic leap.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.440]   Ooh, maybe they don't have it on here.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.560]   Well, I'll put up another pair.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.240]   All right.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.360]   So I don't know.
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.000]   This is a magic leap I'm showing on there.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.800]   The, the Apple one looks sort of similar to that as well.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.080]   So if you're watching this, it's not exactly the coolest thing, but
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.240]   here's why I'm talking about this.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.640]   This article is a little bit dismissive.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.720]   They say this is a Apple is breaking its own rules because it's putting
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.640]   this thing out there that's not a fully polished product, the iPhone,
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.200]   the iPad, the Apple watch.
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.240]   Typically Apple's MO is this a fully polished, a beautiful consumer
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.440]   product, and once it's out there, it's ready to go here, there being
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.680]   a little bit more experimental.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:31.040]   They say, we think the mixed reality is going to be important.
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:33.080]   We're releasing our product.
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:36.200]   It's not a fully polished, ready to go.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.480]   This is the version that a hundred million people are going to buy yet,
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.320]   but we want to put in the market even in this early state.
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.720]   So that's a little bit different for Apple.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.000]   Now the article is a little dismissive.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.520]   It's just, yeah, it has this battery pack.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.400]   It looks kind of nerdy.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.440]   They don't really know what to do with this technology.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.360]   I'm bringing it up, however, because I think this is an
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:56.240]   important development in the technology world that no one is
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:57.560]   talking about at the moment.
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:02.400]   And this comes back to my theory about what the biggest disruption,
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.240]   the consumer technology space is going to be over the next 15 years.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.840]   I'm not convinced as I've talked about before that the mantle of biggest
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:12.880]   disruption is going to get placed on generative AI.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.600]   It might.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:18.520]   I do think AI is going to be a big part of the future of the
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:19.760]   consumer technology space.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.800]   And I think that's going to be a big part of the future of the
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.880]   consumer technology space.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:25.120]   And I think that's going to be a big part of the future of the
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:26.240]   consumer technology space.
