[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Good morning, radicals, and happy Thanksgiving Day.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.360]   So I'm recording the show here.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.300]   It's early on Wednesday morning, the day before the Thanksgiving Day holiday here in the United
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.800]   States and just have a couple of short comments to share with you that I hope will be encouraging
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.680]   to you and then we'll leave it at that.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.080]   I intended to do a more complex show than this, but my week has been somewhat disrupted.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.520]   I was planning to, I had all kinds of plans for this week, but I've spent the last two
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.440]   days and now going into the third day trying to help a friend of mine break out of prison
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.640]   and bond out.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.920]   I'll tell you that story in just a moment, but it's even impacted my own feelings and
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.040]   sense of gratitude about life in general.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.320]   Being in the middle of working in the prison world for the last two days has made me appreciate
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.240]   something as simple as my freedom and personal liberty to travel around.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.500]   Thanksgiving Day is my favorite holiday.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.220]   It's really the only holiday that I celebrate personally and it's always been incredibly
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.640]   meaningful to me and I like everything about the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.800]   I like the history of it.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.040]   I like the tradition.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.040]   I like the focus.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.400]   You know, to sit down and be grateful to God for all of the good things that we have and
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.480]   all of the trials and the challenges that we have is just an incredible opportunity.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.640]   Like most holidays, that Thanksgiving celebration should be a continual thing and I seek to
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.720]   maintain that – this is going to sound so cliche – that attitude of gratitude, that
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.360]   appreciation for the good things of life on an ongoing basis.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.520]   It's so easy to be jaded at all of the good things that we enjoy.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.680]   It's so easy to look around and to despise the comfort that all of you listening to my
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.760]   voice enjoy.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.440]   Just the fact of having a full belly and a comfortable bed to sleep in, these things
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.160]   are tremendous and yet when's the last time that you and I appreciated them?
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.440]   It's probably been a little while.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.800]   My encouragement to you is if you have many things and you're overflowing with thankfulness
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.400]   and gratitude, that's great.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   I'm happy.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.680]   I think that's how it should be.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.360]   But perhaps some of you listening to this right now aren't feeling that particular
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   sensation.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.320]   You aren't feeling that particular attitude.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.880]   Perhaps you're passing through a very challenging time and I guess the primary thing that I
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.920]   want to share with you is that I understand that and I want to encourage you that even
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.160]   in the middle of a challenging time, I want to encourage you to embrace it.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.120]   In many ways, for me, that's been the context of my last year really.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.760]   2016, as I've reflected on the progress that I've made, has been in some ways – and
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.280]   please hear me, I'm not complaining, just simply trying to share with you – but in
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.720]   some ways, 2016 has been a very disappointing year for me.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.200]   Many things have gone well but many of the things that I set out with a clear intention
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.680]   of accomplishing this year have been complete failures.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.040]   That has hurt my self-confidence.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's hurt my recognition or my confidence in my business ability.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.780]   It's been challenging, very, very challenging.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.320]   These things will pass and you sit back and challenges are not something that is unique
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   to me.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.880]   I've faced challenges in different areas.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.000]   But it's just been a fresh challenge.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.760]   And so that's been the context of my life over the last year.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   And I'm working on it.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.960]   I'm making changes.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.040]   But it's easy to look at challenges.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.840]   It's easy to look at problems and to despise them and to say, "Well, everything will
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.040]   be great when everything is going great."
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.260]   And to miss the opportunities and to miss the lessons.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.320]   If you feel that way, please consider recognizing and appreciating the challenges that you're
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.040]   going through.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.440]   One of the things that I've learned as I've grown and matured is not to look for things
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.880]   to be perfect but to embrace the process of growth.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.800]   I used to think that, "Well, if only blah, blah, blah, then everything will be great."
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.640]   Or "When I get blah, blah, blah, everything will be great."
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.400]   Friends, it's not true.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.000]   It's not true.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.320]   You never reach a point in time at which, "Oh, everything is fantastic.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.640]   I have all the money that I want.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.800]   I have perfect marriage.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.680]   I have whatever, the perfect body, perfect health."
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.560]   Life is filled with challenges.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.220]   And if you're looking for those moments, what happens is you miss out on the opportunity
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.600]   of growth all along the way.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.360]   Now it sounds, I feel like it sounds a little bit cliche because everyone's always saying,
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   "Oh, appreciate the opportunity for growth."
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.000]   But it's true.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.640]   Easier said than done but it really is true that in hindsight, if you're going through
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.080]   a difficult time, in hindsight, you'll look back and you'll appreciate the challenges.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.880]   So keep your head up while you're going through the challenges.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:52.200]   If right now you find yourself facing challenges and trials and things that you've never experienced
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:06:02.160]   before, don't try to escape from those things but seek to learn in those circumstances.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.400]   This year my family and I have been memorizing the book of James from the Bible.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.200]   The book of James is my – personally, my favorite book of the Bible.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.980]   My middle name is James so maybe that's always given me a little bit of an affinity
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.340]   for it.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.440]   But the book of James is just eminently practical.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   It's a remarkable book and the thing that is just incredible about it is if you study
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.200]   who James was, James was the half-brother of Jesus.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.040]   He's the one who wrote the book and his story is truly remarkable and you study the
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   history.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.480]   So the book of James starts off with a verse that I have constantly encouraged myself with
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:54.800]   and it describes this process of gratitude all through the middle of circumstances.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.520]   And if you're going to memorize one passage of scripture, this might be a good place to
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   start but the book of James begins after the greeting.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.520]   It says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:14.820]   For you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:22.240]   And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.440]   in nothing."
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.600]   That verse has been encouraging to me so many times to recognize that one of the things
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:40.400]   to embrace about one major positive aspect of trials and of challenges, and by the way,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.960]   I am not complaining.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.000]   I have nothing to complain about.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.480]   All of the trials and the challenges that I've faced compared to so many things are
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.320]   absolutely nothing.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.600]   But still, they're real to me.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.480]   One of the things to embrace through trials is the fact that you can either let the trial
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:05.040]   destroy you or you can let the trial strengthen you.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.960]   But you've got to choose in that.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.000]   And gratitude, choosing to be thankful for a trial, will make a tremendous difference
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.840]   for you.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.040]   I hope that you have many reasons to be grateful.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.600]   I have many, many reasons.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.880]   I even have new ones.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.240]   Let me tell you the story of the prison situation.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.840]   I appreciate the ability to come and go as I please and to do the things that I need
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.840]   to do.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.600]   The last couple of days, I have been trying to help a friend of mine get out of prison.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:47.200]   My friend is an illegal alien and he was arrested by immigration a few weeks ago.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.280]   So his court date was Monday morning, when he first before the judge to have a bond hearing.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.600]   And the hope was that he'd have a bond hearing and that the judge would set a reasonable
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.680]   bond so he could bond out of prison.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.960]   And that was the plan.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.080]   So Monday morning, 8 a.m. court down in Miami at the immigration prison down in Miami.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.840]   So I drove down very early on Monday morning and everything seemed like it would probably
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.720]   happen where he could bond out.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.240]   He was not arrested in conjunction with any crimes.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.560]   He didn't have any other, which is usually in the United States, usually illegal aliens
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.800]   are not particularly bothered unless they're arrested in conjunction with some sort of
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   other crime.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.280]   Now, we'll see.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.920]   President-elect Trump has promised to be much harsher on illegal immigration.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.600]   So we'll see what happens in the coming months.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.040]   But generally, it's not you don't generally get arrested just because you are an illegal
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   immigrant.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.120]   But that happened to my friend.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.200]   He wasn't arrested simply because he was an illegal immigrant.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.920]   So he is an illegal immigrant.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.860]   So he was arrested and in prison.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:00.920]   And so I went down to his court date and it was really remarkable to be there in immigration
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   court.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:10.360]   I've been in court before, both as a potential jurist and also a potential member of a jury
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   and also fighting a traffic ticket I was given one time and some other things like that.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.960]   And I don't spend a lot of time in that world.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.920]   And so it's always remarkable for me.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.040]   But this is my first time in immigration court and kind of seeing there puts another face
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040]   on it.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.380]   I know a lot of illegal immigrants here in the United States because I speak Spanish
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:41.960]   and that opens up a lot of connection and relationship with a lot of illegal aliens
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.280]   who are of Hispanic background.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.600]   But that was my first time in court and seeing kind of just the lives that are hanging on
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:54.360]   the balance of a judge's ruling sobered me.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:01.520]   It really sobered me and made me just recognize how valuable something like your personal
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.760]   liberty to travel as you wish and to come and go and to engage in business as you wish
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.240]   can be.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.600]   My friend was active in business and you get thrown into prison and all of a sudden your
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.320]   whole business is disrupted.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.160]   You can't access your email to be able to contact your customers.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.680]   You can't access your phone.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.800]   You can make a few phone calls but when you make a phone call, it says blah, blah, blah.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.280]   Joshua Sheets calling from the such and such penitentiary.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.680]   It's a little bit challenging.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.720]   And so prison in many ways stops your life.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   It really does.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.240]   It's one of the reasons why I'm generally opposed to prison for most crimes.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.520]   I think it's a wrong-headed system.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.960]   The best system is a system of restitution, not a system of imprisonment.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.760]   Imprisonment is in many ways just simply a modern form of slavery and in many crimes
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.880]   it's an injustice.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.680]   I believe the just approach is to use the biblical pattern of restitution rather than
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.960]   imprisonment and that's freshly driven home by trying to help my friend.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.440]   So the story is that on Monday, I planned to go down there and I figured I'd be done
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.800]   by noon.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.880]   Court date was – court time was 8 AM.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880]   He'd bond out.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.080]   It would take him an hour, hour and a half to process him out.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.480]   This is what I was expecting based upon research and I'd get him out of there by noon.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.800]   Well, remarkable story.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.600]   Getting him out by noon turned into a – has now turned into two entire days of me driving
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.840]   to Miami and sitting there and waiting, trying to get him out.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.720]   I've since found out and learned after much pressing that the problem is actually a computer
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.920]   system.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.760]   The bond was paid for him a couple hours, hour and two after he got out of court and
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.160]   the judge issued the bond order and everything worked out.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.560]   So – but the problem is that they were having a computer system and the computer system
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   would not accept the appropriate payment of the bond.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.120]   The computer system wouldn't acknowledge the bond as being paid and so because of that,
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.600]   they can't let him out.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.040]   Everyone knows that the bond has been paid.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.880]   All of the guards know that he should be released.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.120]   Everyone knows that the system is working fine except the computer doesn't know.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.720]   Because the computer doesn't know, they can't or won't process him out so that
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.280]   he can be out.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.200]   So now my friend has spent an extra two nights in jail and hopefully we'll be able to get
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.360]   him out today.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.960]   My intelligence is that at this point in time, the computer system is not working but evidently
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.320]   it was a national problem all across the United States with the immigrant – immigration
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.680]   prison system.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.760]   Humans worry about that world that we live in where computers control our lives and the
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.560]   humans lose control over the machines.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.920]   In many ways, we're already there.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.440]   All the humans say, "Yes, he should be out."
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   Judge says that the – I don't know what the name for it.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.000]   All the cops, the prison people know that it should be – everything is legally in
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.880]   order but the computer system.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   So the IT people, everything is waiting on the IT people and now the brunt of it is that
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.680]   my – I've lost two and a half days of work that I had planned.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   It was unnecessary – should have been unnecessary and my friend has spent two extra nights in
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.760]   prison.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.000]   So be careful what systems you put computers in control of.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.840]   But you have many things to be thankful for.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.560]   One of the simplest ones, if you're out of prison right now, just be thankful for that
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.440]   because that will disrupt your life.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:40.400]   If you are out of prison and you are in a country where you have opportunity and you're
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.200]   out in fear of your life, my friend, this particular friend, he is from Venezuela and
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.120]   the situation that his family is in in Venezuela, Venezuela seems to be rapidly heading toward
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.520]   a civil war, just a challenge in every situation, in every circumstance.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.400]   So time will tell what ends up happening.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.720]   But you and I have many things to be thankful for.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.800]   If you're in the middle of trials, if you're in the middle of challenges, if your situation
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.760]   is like mine, we reflect back on 2016 and you're disappointed with perhaps things
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:21.120]   that you had hoped to accomplish that you didn't accomplish, it's OK to be disappointed.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.720]   But don't think that that's a reason not to be thankful, not to be grateful for the
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.040]   many good things.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.840]   Because although I'm disappointed in some of the progress that I've made, I have nothing,
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.080]   absolutely nothing to complain about.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:46.320]   And as I start making lists of things that I'm grateful for, I have nothing to complain
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   about.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.640]   I should hardly even be disappointed.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:58.640]   The list of things to be grateful for is so, so massive compared to the list of things
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.320]   to be disappointed about.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.720]   So I encourage you, if you're outside the United States, look up a little bit in the
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:09.460]   history of the US-American tradition of Thanksgiving.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.080]   Make a list of things that you're grateful for and spend some time with your family just
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.000]   appreciating and enjoying those things.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.760]   If you're in the United States, embrace this holiday and just count your blessings.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.680]   Thank God for all of the many blessings that you have in your life.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.160]   We are truly, truly blessed.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.800]   And my just personal note of two things.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.760]   My personal note of thanks is to you, the listening audience.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:46.240]   Radical Personal Finance has grown tremendously this past year.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.180]   It's extremely humbling to me.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:55.520]   It's such a responsibility that I feel very deeply to seek to share with you information
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.000]   that's helpful and that's accurate.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.820]   It's been an incredible challenge for me to learn new skills.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:08.560]   But I just want to thank you for choosing to listen to my show.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.000]   One of the most valuable things that you have is your time and your attention.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.720]   Truly in many ways, that's what your life is made of.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.840]   It's made of, in some ways, time and attention.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.060]   And that's what you give me.
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.960]   I do my absolute best to take that seriously and to seek to give you the best that I'm
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.600]   able to give you.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:39.280]   And I just thank you for choosing to make this show and my message a part of your life.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.880]   And I hope that it has been helpful to you.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.720]   My goal is to serve you, to serve you as effectively as I'm able to.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.880]   And so I thank you for listening to the show.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.120]   I also thank so many of you who are so kind towards me to support me.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:07.440]   I thank you for those of you who write me emails and share your thoughts and your ideas
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.360]   and your opinions, your agreements and your dissent.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.440]   I appreciate each and every one of you who does that.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:20.820]   One thing I'm extremely proud of and grateful for is the tone and the tenor of the radical
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.440]   personal finance community.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:30.360]   Many of you write emails to me talking about something that I said.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:37.000]   And the vast majority of you are kind and respectful and thoughtful.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.440]   There are always a few people who are emotionally charged and upset.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.600]   And you can't blame people.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:50.160]   Oftentimes, people have not been taught how to disagree with somebody in a calm and thoughtful
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   way.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.880]   And so they bring that, the tone and the rancor of society that's basically taught this, tear
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.560]   each other apart and yell at each other society that we have.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.120]   And they bring that to other places.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.040]   But I think many of those people have been filtered out.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:13.240]   And the vast majority of you are so incredibly kind and so gracious and thoughtful in the
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.240]   things that you write me.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.120]   I just wanted to compliment you on that.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.960]   It's been a goal of mine when I started the show to create an environment where people
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:31.800]   of diverse opinions and strongly held convictions could discuss those opinions and convictions
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.120]   in a thoughtful and reasonable way.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.640]   And I'm very proud of the progress we've made.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.240]   And you, the listening audience, have contributed to that hugely.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.240]   So thank you for that.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.080]   Thank you to those of you, again, who write me emails.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.360]   I am extremely backlogged on communication.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.920]   We'll get to the major reason why in just a moment.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.080]   Also thank you to every one of you who chooses voluntarily to support the show financially.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.800]   That is a tremendous honor.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.600]   And in many ways, one of my major disappointments for this year has just been that I haven't
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.520]   felt like I've delivered on some of the things that I've wanted to deliver on.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.040]   Not asking for sympathy, working on it.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.880]   Fixing, doing my very best.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.120]   Just feels like I'm constantly apologizing for the things that I haven't been able to
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.600]   do, but I'm working on it.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.120]   But thank you to those of you who've stuck with me through this growth process as I'm
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.560]   learning new things, as I'm growing, as I'm learning business skills, as I'm trying to
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.760]   shore up the areas that are weak, as I'm trying to recognize those areas of my character and
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.400]   personality that don't work and change those things.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.440]   I'm just incredibly grateful to you.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.160]   I am incredibly grateful.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.720]   And I guess I'll close just with this.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.400]   I was going to do this as a separate episode on the topic and I will more in the future,
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   but if you've made it to this point, my wife and I are also extremely thankful and you
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.000]   can rejoice with us that we are expecting another baby.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.020]   So we're very excited next year, about the early to middle of next year, there should
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.080]   be the birth of a third child into our family.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.260]   And so we are rejoicing tremendously in that.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:17.800]   It's also been one of the major challenges over the last few months.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.240]   We're out of the first trimester at this point in time, but the first trimester is often
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.280]   the most challenging part, at least for me, it's one of the most challenging part of a
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.920]   pregnancy.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:34.260]   And the reason is just simply because my wife during the first trimester and many women
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:39.320]   who during the first trimester, that's when they need a lot of the most physical help
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.880]   when my wife is not feeling well.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   And so it's been a challenge to know how to do that and means that I end up doing basically
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.080]   the vast majority of the cooking, a lot of the work, the physical work in the house that
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.200]   my wife is too weak to be able to do and also with children and things like that.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.920]   And so that's been challenging over the last few months, a good challenge, but a challenge
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   nonetheless.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.920]   Thankfully, we're out of the first trimester.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.200]   So the next few months I'm very excited about, I've got a lot of work to do here even before
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.000]   the third child is born because the two, for those of you who aren't parents, the two very
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:24.800]   difficult phases of children can be the first trimester and then the period immediately
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.160]   following the birth of the baby.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.480]   Both of our previous two babies have been incredibly just like sick and colicky and
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.040]   whatnot for the first few months.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.640]   So mentally my wife and I have to prepare for that.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.920]   Hopefully this one will be different, but regardless we're prepared for that either
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.000]   way.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.560]   So the next few months are very crucial for me in terms of especially my business work
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.520]   that now my wife is stronger so I have more time to be able to do some of the things that
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.240]   I need to do and I'm incredibly grateful.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.440]   So rejoice with us.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.040]   That is one thing that we are very, very thankful for is that we now have a third child and
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.120]   rejoice with us as we transition into the next year.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.600]   Those are the comments that I have to share.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.240]   I'll be out the rest of the week as we travel here and again this week was very mixed up
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.160]   with helping my friend.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:21.280]   But again, if you want a reason to be thankful, try to help a friend get out of prison.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.040]   That'll help you to be thankful.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.360]   Working with this friend who's been in prison, I haven't had a lot of friends who've been
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:33.600]   in prison, some of you have, but it's definitely made me appreciate how challenging it is for
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.320]   people who are in prison.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.720]   So if you know somebody, maybe just one idea, consider going and number one, serving their
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.520]   family, helping their family during this period of time or go and visit your friends who are
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.760]   in prison and encourage them.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.680]   It's very, very difficult in there and perhaps that might be one area of service that you
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:00.080]   can do to serve somebody who is in a more difficult place than you are.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.040]   I will be back with you next week after the Thanksgiving holiday.
