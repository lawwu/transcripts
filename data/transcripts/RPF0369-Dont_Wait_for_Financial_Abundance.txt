[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   In past episodes of Radical Personal Finance, I've talked about the seven stages of financial
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.760]   independence which I designed a couple years ago.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.600]   These stages are where you go from stage zero financial dependence and systematically, step
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.520]   by step, work your way through financial independence and on to financial abundance.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.320]   But the reality is this process is going to take a really long time for most of us.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.560]   It's going to take, at the minimum, a few years.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.040]   At the most, maybe many decades and perhaps our whole life.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   So here's the question.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000]   What if there were a way to short circuit the process?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.880]   What if you could skip straight from where you are to stage seven, financial abundance,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.520]   without passing through all of the other stages?
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.520]   Would that be worth it?
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:01:08.920]   Well, I think you can and today I'm going to share with you some ideas on how.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.160]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.360]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.280]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host and today we get philosophical.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.400]   I think there's a way to short circuit this whole process and yes, I know I designed the
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.800]   model so maybe I designed it from the beginning to be collapsed.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.440]   But I'm going to talk to you about some things that I don't hear many people talking about
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   and I hope you benefit.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.560]   And throughout this world of financial independence, wealth building, retirement, early retirement,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.480]   just this whole world that I live and work in, there are a lot of concepts and a lot
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.800]   of things that we often skip past.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   And I've been thinking a lot.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.200]   I've threatened to do this show a number of times, this show on skipping straight to financial
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   abundance.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   I've been thinking a lot about it though.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.040]   This last few days, last week I was interviewed on Paula Pant's program at affordanything.com
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.480]   on her podcast.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.280]   And she released that show and it seemed to be fairly popular.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.280]   I've gotten some good feedback on that.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.880]   And in that show, the dominant topic of conversation was these stages of financial independence.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.260]   In short, for those of you who are new listeners, I began with stage zero, financial dependence,
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.080]   move on to stage one, financial solvency, stage two, financial stability, stage three,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.320]   financial freedom, stage four, financial security, stage five, financial independence, stage
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.040]   six, financial freedom, and stage seven being financial abundance.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.760]   So I kind of broke this process of wealth building down into some more actionable steps
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.880]   to try to get more wins and more celebrations along the way.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.360]   If you're interested in that, go back and listen to episode 174 of Radical Personal
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.940]   Finance or jump over to affordanything.com and you can listen to the podcast there.
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.200]   It is episode 39 of her show.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.560]   And I'll do more shows on it in the future.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.160]   And I'll probably release that show into my RSS feed at some point in the future so that
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.440]   you can hear Paula's interview when I'm traveling, something like that.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.320]   But I really enjoyed talking about these stages.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:22.240]   But even when I was designing them, I was trying to figure out how does this make sense.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.920]   And who knows, I might change them in the future.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.440]   But the one that most intrigues me and that really intrigues a lot of people is stage
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.680]   seven, financial abundance.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.100]   Let me articulate what financial abundance is very clearly by just simply reading off
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.480]   of the website at radicalpersonalfinance.com where I wrote this.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.280]   Stage seven is financial abundance.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.440]   When you reach this stage of your financial journey, you've reached the most challenging
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.960]   stage of all.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.600]   But it can be a very enjoyable challenge.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.680]   You've accumulated wealth beyond the amount needed to fund your own lifestyle expenses
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.960]   with a comfortable margin of safety.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.120]   Now you have to decide how to responsibly manage the surplus.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.560]   How will you allocate it productively while you control it?
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.760]   And who will control it when you're done with it?
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.960]   How will you assure that the money is used for good and not for evil?
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.800]   It's a real challenge, but it's one faced by all those who have faithfully and steadily
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.760]   built wealth throughout their lifetimes.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.640]   It's the most important stage of all.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.920]   So that's how I define financial abundance.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.640]   And we've passed through this point of meeting all of your own needs, meeting all of your
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.680]   current needs plus any future anticipated needs, and you've got plenty of money is
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.520]   the idea.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.280]   But I'm convinced that you don't have to wait until you've got that point to experience
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.520]   this mindset.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.360]   I'm convinced you can have this mindset of financial abundance from the beginning.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   And I don't mean this mindset of kind of this airy fairy, I'm just going to imagine that
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.360]   I have financial abundance.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.480]   I'm going to sit in my easy chair and imagine $100 bills floating into my life.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.720]   I mean, okay, if some people want to delude themselves, that's fine, but I prefer to stay
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.920]   in the world of honest, you know, I prefer not to start by lying to myself.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.520]   So imagining dollar bills floating into your life is, I don't know, for some people maybe
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.400]   it's valuable, but more valuable to imagine what you're trying to accomplish and then
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   imagine the plan to get there and then get busy and get to work.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.680]   It doesn't come from imagining, it comes from work.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   But we're not going to talk about it in that sense.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   We're going to talk about it in a very real sense of enjoying and appreciating that you
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.320]   can move always from a place of financial abundance.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.760]   Because if you're listening to the sound of my voice right now, I'm pretty confident just
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.880]   due to the fact that you have internet access, most likely on a mobile device, and that you
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.120]   speak English.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:58.000]   Guess what, the vast majority of you are wealthy, incredibly wealthy on a global standard.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.840]   We don't often stop to appreciate that.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.480]   You already have financial abundance.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.220]   Even if you think back to the way that I wrote this, think about how many of these things
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.960]   apply to you.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.080]   Because I was careful to not necessarily put in here that you can do this all off of the
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.560]   income from your investments.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.520]   Read this again and let me ask you this.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.120]   You've accumulated wealth beyond the amount needed to fund your own lifestyle expenses
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.400]   with a comfortable margin of safety.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.460]   Now I know that not all of you, and in fact very few of you listening, have that amount
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.400]   of wealth sitting behind where you can just live on your wealth.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.120]   But do you not have enough money, enough wealth to fund your own lifestyle expenses?
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.040]   And do you not have a somewhat comfortable margin of safety?
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.920]   Can you have some excess every month?
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.240]   I know not everybody, many of you are struggling, but the majority of you are already there.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.960]   Now you have to decide how to responsibly manage the surplus.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.080]   Do you not have some surplus in your budget?
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.760]   How will you allocate it productively while you control it?
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.440]   And who will control it when you're done with it?
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.400]   Do you not already have that problem?
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.600]   You die and leave your house to your errors.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.400]   Well, is that what you should do or should you do something else?
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.000]   How will you assure that the money is used for good and not for evil?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.400]   Now I know I'm part of the now generation.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.240]   I know that the idea is that we're supposed to get everything now.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.400]   We just, you know, my age, my generation, we want to be at the top now.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.040]   Well, there's good things and bad things about that.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.840]   The bad thing is if we get into this delusion of saying that we just deserve it simply because
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.560]   we exist, I deserve to be at the top of my pay scale because I just started and I'm really
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   good looking.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   Well, come on.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.280]   But on the other hand, that now idea is really valuable because why wait if you don't have
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   to?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.640]   Why wait if you've already developed the skills?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.960]   Why wait if you figured out a different way to do things?
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:07.120]   I'm very much part of the now generation because I always think constantly, you know, as Stephen
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.960]   Covey said, I begin with the end in mind and I think the best end in mind to begin with
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.720]   is the fact that you're going to die.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   I'm going to die.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.320]   Now we don't know when it is, but you're going to die and I'm going to die.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.760]   And so we always begin with that in mind and what's going to happen at that situation.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.680]   So with regard to the now generation, this, or my being part of the now generation, this
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.200]   dramatically affects my own personal lifestyle.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.000]   I tell my family and friends and I tell you now, don't give me a nice eulogy at my funeral.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.060]   I mean, I'm sure that'll happen.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.300]   Thank you very much.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:43.520]   But tell me now, go ahead and write me a note now and encourage me or do that to somebody
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.520]   else.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.160]   Don't wait to give your dad or your mom or your best friend a nice eulogy.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.120]   Tell them how you feel now while they can actually appreciate it.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.880]   Because when they're dead, they're dead and gone.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.000]   They're not listening to you from the casket.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.780]   Funerals are for the people who are alive, not for the person who's dead.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.120]   So make sure that when you get to your friend's funeral, your family member's funerals, that
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.560]   you're not left anything unsaid.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.720]   Don't send me flowers when I'm dead.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   Does me no good.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.320]   I can't smell the flowers.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.960]   I can't admire the beauty.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.120]   Send them to me now.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.620]   August 25th is a great day to give flowers.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.600]   That way they can be enjoyed and appreciated.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.560]   Don't wait to give someone in your family flowers when they're dead.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.640]   Send them to them now.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.800]   And then the same thing, don't leave money to me when you're dead.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.400]   Tell my parents, "Don't leave money to me when you're dead.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.920]   Either give it to me now while I can spend it and invest it and we can enjoy it together.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.980]   Or if you want to spend it on me, spend it on me now.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.920]   Or let's work on it now."
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.480]   But why wait?
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.440]   Yes, obviously there's a need for the money and we have a certain need.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.220]   There are some assets that are only going to pass at death because they're being used.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.240]   But we can do a lot now if we pay attention.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.400]   So what's the point of waiting to the time when you get the least enjoyment out of something
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.120]   when you can get there quicker?
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.480]   Why wait?
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:23.160]   Why work like a maniac so that someday you can go and fish when you can walk down to
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.120]   the shores of a river or creek or pond or lake or ocean near you and drop a fishing
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.160]   pole in the water after work today?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.360]   The deferred life plan is not a great plan.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.640]   Now there's a season for all things.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.800]   There's a season to work and there's a season to rest.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:50.240]   But the idea that I fight against is that somehow you push everything to the future.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.140]   I don't think you have to.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.080]   Now there are many paradoxes of finance.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.500]   Almost titles today show the paradoxes of finance because I've been thinking about these
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.020]   things that just seem so evident to me based upon the vantage point that I have of looking
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.280]   at the industry and talking to people.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.360]   I hope you hear it in the way that I interview people.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.640]   I hope you hear it when I interview people who are wealthy and I ask, "What's great about
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.400]   what you've experienced and what's not great about what you've experienced?"
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   Now think back to the interviews you've listened to in all 360 something episodes of the show
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:25.240]   and think back and ask yourself, "Have I ever heard a rich person say, 'Wow, my life just
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.600]   totally changed when I got rich.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.640]   It was just so much better.'"
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:36.840]   You haven't heard that, have you?
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.640]   Because when you're rich, you're just more of who you are now.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.480]   And here are some of the paradoxes of wealth.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.380]   First, let me talk about the paradoxes of health.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:53.100]   One of the things that's plagued me and dogged my heels for many years was the idea of dieting
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:59.940]   so that someday I would be skinny without the idea of embracing a different lifestyle.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:07.020]   And I've noticed that people who are healthy and who are fit and who are skinny, in order
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:12.960]   to get that way and achieve that result and to keep it for a long term, they have to change
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.280]   their perspective.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:24.700]   They can't have the perspective of, "I'm going to diet so that I can eat whatever I want."
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.920]   They have to change it and say, "I'm going to become a different person and I'm going
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:35.940]   to choose to value what it's like to be healthy and thin and fit more than I value the taste
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.000]   of junk food."
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.040]   Keep that idea in your mind that you can observe in society around as we talk about the paradoxes
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.980]   of wealth, because I'm convinced it's a very good metaphor.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:00.840]   In the same way that you don't get thin and fit and healthy by going on a diet for a short
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.760]   period of time to achieve it so you can go back to your old way, you don't get rich by
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.960]   pursuing some get rich quick scheme so that you can get rich and then go back and spend
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   all your money.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.720]   The only thing that works over the long term is to become a different person.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.000]   That's what's so paradoxical about wealth.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.740]   Because poor people often pursue wealth with the idea that they'll be able to get a lot
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.040]   of stuff.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.340]   Now, wealthy people often have some nice stuff.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:40.280]   All the houses on Palm Beach Island and the yachts on the shores where I live, they're
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.840]   owned by somebody.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.480]   But usually they're not so into stuff as the guy next door who's out polishing his new
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.220]   boat every weekend.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.480]   It's just that the stuff is kind of nice and it's just a small fraction of their net worth
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.280]   and it's great to have, but it's not all about the stuff.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.400]   So recognize the fact that when you're wealthy, you probably won't be all that into the ownership
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.000]   and acquisition of stuff.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.660]   Because in order to become wealthy, you probably gave up some of that along the way.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.720]   And when you are in the future, going ahead and buying some stuff, it's going to be with
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.440]   a small portion of your net worth and it's just nice to have.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.160]   It's nice to have a ski boat so the grandkids can have something to do and it's nice to
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.360]   have a lake house where all the family can gather.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.240]   But if you had to sell the lake house, no big deal.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240]   You could do it.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.440]   Now, one that's been challenging to me is recognize this, when you're wealthy and you
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.400]   don't have to do anything with your time, you're probably not going to be all that into
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:45.440]   free time as you are right now where you're working and saying, "Oh, if I just had a break,
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.480]   if I just had a vacation."
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.720]   When you're successful, you probably won't be all that into slothfulness.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.640]   Learned this one myself more and more, that when you get yourself in a position where
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.680]   you don't have to work or you don't have to work on somebody else's projects, you'll probably
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:11.480]   find that you'll want to work and you're going to be working more than other people.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:18.040]   Self-employed people, wealthy people often seem to work much harder than many other people.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.080]   Why?
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.520]   Because their goal wasn't just free time.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.780]   The goal wasn't just slothfulness.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.600]   When you've traveled a lot, you probably won't be all that into travel.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.680]   You'll probably want to stay home a little bit.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.600]   Now, to all things, there's a season.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.680]   I'm not opposed to rest.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.800]   I'm not opposed to vacation.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.880]   I'm not opposed to sabbaticals.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.400]   I'm not opposed to stuff.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.320]   I'm not opposed to travel.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.220]   But those aren't the goal.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.360]   Those are just things along the way.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.140]   Self-gratification is limited in its enjoyment.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:05.360]   Rest is most valuable when you're tired from work, not as a lifestyle.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:11.320]   Have a neighbor of mine, lives on Social Security, very small amount of income, lives very frugally.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.000]   All he does is basically watch movies all day.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Drives me nuts.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.840]   I cannot imagine doing what he does.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.840]   Now, are we different people?
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.840]   Obviously.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.560]   We're different personalities, yes.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.320]   But I just don't know how to relate.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.360]   I mean, I have to recognize my own limitations.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.600]   Maybe even some of you listening say, "I'm nothing like Joshua."
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.340]   Yeah, Joshua, that sounds great.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.340]   I don't know.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:40.760]   I don't know how to relate to you if sitting around and watching movies all day, every
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:46.500]   day, seven days a week is your thing.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.500]   I don't know.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.800]   I respect your ability to be an individual person and to do what you like to do, but
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   I don't get it.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   I don't get it.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.000]   It seems like a waste to me.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.520]   Why waste your life on stuff that doesn't matter?
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.440]   Invest your life into something that matters.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.120]   That's why retirement, in my opinion, is a very short-sighted decision.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.600]   Now, here I'm not talking about stopping to do work or quitting a job.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.320]   I'm talking about retirement as this idea that we're going to go from being productive
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.580]   to being unproductive.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.160]   Why would you stop being productive?
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.060]   Why would you stop contributing?
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.820]   Why would you stop working?
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.820]   Don't do that.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.720]   Now, if you want to change, cool.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   Go for it.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.240]   I don't think I'll be doing radical personal finance in a couple of decades.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.080]   I'll be doing something else.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:40.180]   I don't think that if you work for GE, you need to work for GE the rest of your life.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.080]   But don't pull out of the things that matter.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.440]   Adjust every stage along the line.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.880]   That's what's so great is that if you get freed from this idea that I've got to work
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.640]   this career for 30 years so that I can retire and dispense with the whole retirement goal,
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:05.200]   it opens you up to other approaches, other possibilities, other things.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.560]   To me, even though I'm probably struggling to articulate it, I don't want to necessarily
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:17.920]   go into all of my hopes and dreams, but it just seems like I've got so many compelling
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.640]   things, so many compelling projects, so many things I want to do, I can't imagine turning
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.600]   around and saying, "Oh, I'm not going to do anything."
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:33.360]   Now, I couldn't have said that some years ago.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.000]   That's one of the most important things about pursuing financial independence is as you
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.160]   start to experience and enjoy the process and start to recognize that you do have some
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.280]   freedom, that you do have some capital, that you do have some control.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.360]   It opens your mind to different things.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.360]   It's hard to tell a mailroom employee, "Oh, yeah, fishing, it's not that great," if they
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.920]   don't like being in the mailroom, if they feel like their work in the mailroom doesn't
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.280]   matter and they're dreaming about going and fishing.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:10.920]   It's a lot easier to tell someone who's out on the fishing river who's enjoying it and
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.800]   saying, "Yeah, this is good, but you know what?
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:18.040]   I'm also excited to get back to my work on Monday morning."
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.780]   So consider carefully the lifestyle that you want to live and build it intentionally now.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:29.920]   The reason that I spend so much time on this show and in past episodes talking about imagine
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.840]   the lifestyle that you would be at if you were financially independent, imagine it,
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.320]   is because I don't think that lifestyle for most people looks like sitting around and
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.000]   watching movies.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.560]   You don't have to take my goals on for yourself, and please don't.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.120]   You don't have to take my desired lifestyle.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.960]   We're individual, unique human beings.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.960]   We're unique.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.200]   There's no one else like you.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.040]   There's no one else that's going to put things together.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.460]   But imagine the lifestyle that you're working towards and then see how you can get there
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.560]   more quickly.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.560]   The key that I want you to focus in on is once people reach financial abundance where
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:18.000]   they have more money than they can spend, more money than they need to cover all of
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:28.820]   their needs along the way, they start to consider the meaning and the impact of their life.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:34.800]   If you ask wealthy retirees, some of which are in the audience, some of which of you
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.280]   are listening to me right now while you're driving around in your RV or you're sitting
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.840]   out on your back deck looking out over your retirement home, if you ask them what matters
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:50.040]   to them, the number one thing they'll tell you is their family.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.400]   It's always what it is.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.680]   Well, if that's the truth, and if you don't believe me, you go do your own research.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:07.000]   Go talk to all the wealthy retirees that you know and ask them how important to them going
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.800]   and seeing their grandkids is, being with their family for Christmas.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.480]   Most of them tell me their family is their number one most important thing.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.960]   Well, if that's the case, doesn't it make sense to pay attention to that all along the
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   way?
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:32.440]   You don't have to have an RV to be able to prioritize time with your family.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.840]   You don't have to be financially independent to be able to prioritize experiences with
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.120]   your family.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:45.480]   Begin with the end in mind, and instead of pursuing the foolish treadmill existence that
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.240]   so many of us see around us where you just work, work, work, work, work, work, work,
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.120]   work, work, work, so that someday you'll wake up and be rich and then pursue the things
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   that you're going to do.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.960]   Work, work, work, and along the way pursue the things that you're going to enjoy when
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.960]   you're rich.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.240]   And if time with family is there, why don't you pull back a little bit on your work during
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.880]   the time with family and spend a little bit of time with the people that are near you.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.720]   Make the Christmas holiday a priority.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.840]   Don't go back to work the day after Thanksgiving.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:25.080]   Adjust things and pay attention.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.680]   Build the legacy.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.520]   Work into it.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.440]   So recognize that when you're old and rich and when you have this financial abundance,
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.360]   there are going to be some things that are going to be important to you and family is
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.560]   going to be at the top of the list.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.560]   What else?
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.560]   What other impact?
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.880]   Well, there's going to be about the lives of the people that you're with.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.040]   You're going to be considering, "Did I encourage that person?
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   Was I a good boss?
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   Was I a good co-worker?
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.440]   Was I a good leader?"
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:56.280]   So recognize that and don't lose sight of that along the way as you're building wealth.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.600]   Make sure that you can look forward to your retirement party and have it well filled with
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:08.760]   people who appreciate how you've sowed into their lives.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.360]   When it comes to your money, think carefully about what would happen with your money when
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.960]   you're old and rich and have more of it than you can spend and you got to figure out what
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.560]   to do with it.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:27.520]   And recognize that your money is probably not going to be your legacy.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.580]   Think about this.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.480]   If you were going to make a list of historical figures, people that you admire, that you
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.920]   know about, that you studied in school, how many of them are notable simply for the fact
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:45.160]   that they were rich versus how many of them were notable for the impact or the legacy
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:50.360]   that they left in some other way?
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.400]   You can look at this from almost any extreme.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.200]   Henry David Thoreau, was he a legend?
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.000]   Is he honored and read about in freshman classes, college classes?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.160]   Is Walden Pond, on Walden Pond read because he was rich?
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.360]   Or was it read because he wrote a book?
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.880]   You don't have to be rich to write a book.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.640]   You don't even need a typewriter.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.120]   You don't need a computer.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.080]   You can sit down with a pen and a sheet of paper and write a book.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.760]   I feel like we often forget this these days.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.840]   I was thinking about Jane Austen the other day and I was thinking about her life and
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:34.440]   I was thinking about how she composed all of her books, wrote all of her books out by
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.200]   hand using a pen and many sheets of paper.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:48.040]   You ever stop to think about how simple that is and yet how many people have done it?
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:53.320]   One job I had when I was a boy was I had a friend of ours who had written an autobiography
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.960]   and I typed it for him.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:04.880]   This was 20 years ago perhaps and he sat down with legal pads and a pen and he wrote out
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.280]   his autobiography.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:13.160]   Now, the first place I go is I'm not saying you should probably use a computer.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.760]   It's a little bit more efficient.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.040]   But my point is to show that you don't need that much money.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.200]   You don't need to go and buy a brand new Macbook and put Scrivener on there in order to have
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.720]   all the latest greatest writing tools.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.120]   You just need a pen and a piece of paper.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.600]   And yet how many people have a legacy and have made an impact on the world because of
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:38.240]   the time that they took to sit down and write a book or make a speech?
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.520]   And yet how many rich people are there who if they didn't pay attention to their legacy,
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.480]   if they didn't pay attention to the things that they were going to leave behind and just
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.280]   left money, they're forgotten.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.360]   Because guess what?
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:57.280]   When you die and leave all your money behind, that money will be spent quickly.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.440]   Probably much more quickly than you want it to be.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:14.600]   But ideas, impact, contribution, service, love, those things will continue.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.840]   So are you paying attention to your legacy?
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.600]   Is there something that you should be adjusting and not focusing first on money?
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.320]   Because pay attention.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.040]   Once you've reached financial abundance, you're going to stop thinking so much about money
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.760]   and you're going to be thinking about your legacy.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.200]   Don't wait to get there.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.600]   Now what's actually going to happen with your money?
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.360]   Well who's it going to go to?
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.560]   For most people there's two major things.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.680]   Number one is your children.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.920]   Number two is your charity.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:52.720]   So if you don't start from a place of financial abundance, you might make the mistake that
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:58.440]   many wealthy people make, where they're so focused on earning the money and building
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:04.180]   the capital and piling it up that they forget to slow down and train their children how
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.340]   to handle it.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.160]   And guess what happens?
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:13.360]   You die, you leave the money to your kids, and it ruins their lives and your grandkids'
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.760]   lives.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.200]   Because you didn't start from a place of financial abundance.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.480]   You weren't beginning with the end of mind.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.320]   You weren't recognizing the fact that someday you're going to leave a lot of money behind
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:34.600]   and you better do the work now to make sure that your kids do not squander the inheritance.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.120]   So if you recognize that, then the way that you skip to step seven and you're thinking
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.520]   about financial abundance, then along the way you work on training your kids.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.240]   And it starts from day one.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:55.240]   You train character, you train discipline, you train the skills of self-control, you
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:02.220]   train the ability to defer gratification, you train work habits, you train diligence.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.960]   You train these things in your children.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.720]   Then that way, when you're old and rich and you die and leave a lot of money to them,
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.440]   then you're not giving it to them in a way that's going to ruin their lives.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.040]   Rather, what they will be able to do is they'll have the capacity to take that money and then
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.680]   continue to channel it and continue to invest it into the types of things that you will
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.560]   be proud of.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:33.280]   So begin with the end in mind and recognize that financial abundance is where you're going,
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.920]   but you can't wait until you're 63 years old to start thinking about it.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.320]   You got to get there now.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.480]   Now guess what?
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.780]   Should you wait until you're 63 or until you're 93 years old and you die to leave all the
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.120]   money to your kids?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.040]   I don't think so.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:56.080]   How does it help your 45-year-old son or daughter when they're finally kind of established in
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.440]   their career and finally have some money?
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.960]   How does it help them for you to die at that point in time and leave them a lot of money?
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.040]   Wouldn't it be a lot more helpful to help them at the early stages of their life?
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.920]   Well, you already know that intuitively.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.600]   That's why you're thinking about paying for their schooling and paying for their college,
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.600]   et cetera.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   But what about more than that?
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.400]   What about helping them establish their business?
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.760]   What about helping them build a house?
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.160]   What about helping them fund some of these things at the beginning of their life?
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.080]   Most parents that I've interacted with have the idea about paying for school and paying
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.680]   for college, but they're not thinking about the rest of it.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.320]   And they want to leave a lot of money when they're dead, but they don't want to invest
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.480]   when they're younger and when they're alive.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:46.200]   Even for investing when they're younger, when they're alive.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   That way you can see it.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.120]   You can monitor the results.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.120]   And that's when your children need it.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:56.600]   If you do a good job investing in your children in the early years, they won't need or want
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   your money later.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.440]   They'll just say, "Dad, I don't need it.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.780]   Mom, I don't need it.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.640]   Just give it to somebody else."
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.080]   But if you don't do a good job in the early years, they'll be desperate for your money
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.920]   and it'll destroy them.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:20.080]   So train your children.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.720]   What about the other aspect, charity?
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:28.280]   I think this is the other place that people are very short-sighted.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.800]   Why are you looking forward to charity?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.360]   Why are you looking forward to doing something in the future instead of doing something now?
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.000]   You say, "Well, there's some compelling reasons.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I'm focused on my business."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.280]   Well, that's true.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.400]   There are different stages to life and I have no problem with that.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.680]   There are times, there are seasons.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.560]   There are seasons of family, there are seasons of business, there are seasons where you should
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.440]   be doing more or should be doing less.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.600]   But when you're old and rich, you're going to be looking at a pile of money and you're
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:10.720]   going to be wondering what to do with it.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.700]   The answer, the solution is that you're going to want to solve some kind of problem.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:22.280]   If you look at what rich people do with their money, they certainly buy for themselves a
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.480]   nice lifestyle.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.400]   They certainly enjoy some of the trappings of wealth.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.180]   They enjoy the ski vacations.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.440]   They enjoy the fancy house.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.520]   They enjoy the private yachts and the private planes and they enjoy being able to do nice
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   things for their family.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.520]   That stuff's cool.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.120]   I'm okay with it.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:43.800]   But once those things are taken care of, they're thinking about their impact.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.880]   They're funding super PACs to change elections.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.480]   They're funding activist groups.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.920]   They're funding the changes that they want to see in the world.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   Guess what?
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:06.160]   You should be doing the same and you should be doing it now, not when you're dead.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.880]   Because once you're dead, you lose effectively all control over the money.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.920]   Even if you've gone through and developed a beautifully written airtight trust that
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:23.440]   clearly lays out what you want to direct your trustee to do, there's no guarantee, there's
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:31.200]   no way to guarantee that your trustees will not find a way to change what they're doing.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.880]   Some of the most well-planned estates and some of the most well-meaning people, their
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.560]   descendants are spending the money that they had accumulated in ways that would make them
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:45.980]   roll over in their grave if they could see it today.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:54.920]   So go ahead and get busy funding the changes that you want to see in the world.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:00.060]   Go ahead and get busy investing into the things that are going to make an impact.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.520]   Put your money where your mouth is and do it now while you can see the results and measure
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520]   the impact.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:11.040]   Because you need to develop the skills and prove the concepts when they're small.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:16.120]   Could you imagine if I gave you $1 billion and I said, "You've got to figure out what
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:21.720]   to do with this $1 billion in a way that's going to do something good."
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.600]   What would you do?
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.920]   If you actually think and consider that problem, my guess would be that you'd have no idea
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.560]   of what to do.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.400]   I've thought about that problem.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.680]   I don't know that I would have anything to know.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.360]   I don't think I would know what to do with the money.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:44.120]   I would be so overwhelmed if I were just handed $1 billion.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.120]   Where do you start?
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.920]   What do you do?
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.600]   Which is why, what do you see rich people doing?
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   I'm going to line up and I'm not going to do my own thing.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.800]   I'm going to give to Bill and Melinda Gates because they've got the infrastructure set
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.840]   up.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.440]   Which there's some arguments to be made in that.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.400]   My point is, consider, would you know what to do with $1 billion?
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:14.320]   If you don't know how to effectively invest $100 into something that you want to see changed,
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.520]   charitable contribution, something that's wrong with the world that you want to improve.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:24.400]   If you don't know how to invest $100, why are you worrying about the millions?
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.400]   Start now.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.280]   Do the $100.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.760]   Do the $1,000.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   Fund a little project.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.760]   Test it.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   See if it works.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.280]   If it works, put more money into it.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.120]   If it doesn't work, scrap it and move on.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.560]   So much money is wasted in these large charitable organizations because there's no call for
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   efficiency.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.160]   There's not enough supervision.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.760]   So fund the projects and make them prove themselves out.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.040]   Make sure they work.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.600]   And if you don't have the money for charity right now, guess what?
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:01.160]   You can still experience the benefits of giving by giving in other ways.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.320]   You don't need to fund the construction of a Habitat for Humanity house with a $100,000
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.760]   check if you don't have an extra $100,000 to give away.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.360]   But your next door neighbor could sure use a hand building their shed.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   Why don't you start there?
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.160]   Or why don't you go ahead and make the rent payment for the single mom down the street
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.240]   who just lost her job?
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:27.040]   Or bring some groceries to those other people who are facing a hard time?
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   You found out about somebody who just lost their job, call them up, ask them what the
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.840]   size of diapers their kid is wearing and put an Amazon subscribe and save order in for
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.440]   a while until they find another one.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.200]   Those are simple things.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.080]   And yet those are ways that you can build the habit and enjoy the abundance that you
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.600]   already have.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.880]   And if those causes are important to you, you'll gain the most in the future by being
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:06.560]   able to give money to them if you're already involved in what the organization is doing.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:11.360]   Why would you give a lot of money someday to an organization that you haven't given
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.220]   a little money to before?
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:19.180]   Or why would you give money to the organization if you haven't been out with them seeing their
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:26.400]   work first hand yourself?
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.880]   If you go ahead and get involved now, you can experience the joy of seeing the impact
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:37.320]   while you're working your way through the stages of financial independence.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.080]   There's always a way to make a difference in it.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:47.160]   If you focus on where you're going to be down the road and you think about financial abundance
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.560]   and then you think back to today, I bet you can come up with some unique ways that you
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:58.120]   as an individual can start to enjoy the fruits of your labor now.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:03.200]   And it'll make the work that you're doing today seem much more meaningful and much more
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.640]   fulfilling because you're coming from a place of abundance.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.900]   You're coming recognizing the path that you're on.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:25.140]   I think you can learn from the exposure and the impact and the interviews I've done that
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:29.620]   these are the things that people look for.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.640]   Go talk to the rich people in your town and I bet you they'll spend more time talking
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:40.500]   about the Boys and Girls Club or the Junior Achievement or the Halfway House or whatever
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.940]   it is that they're involved in.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.140]   They'll spend more time talking about that stuff that they're involved in, that they
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:52.940]   care about than they will about their new boat.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.700]   So recognize that you're probably going to be similar to them as you walk a similar path
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.460]   and move from a place of financial abundance.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.460]   I feel clumsy in my articulation of this concept.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.500]   I often feel clumsy in my ability to articulate many of these things and I just feel like
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.500]   I got to get this out there.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.820]   Forgive me if this was clumsy.
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:19.180]   I know it seems like I'm violating even the stages but I really do think there are stages
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.980]   and I don't think these things are in conflict.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:30.500]   I'm working to become completely financially independent but I'm not waiting for financial
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.060]   independence in order to function and to labor at the things that I believe are the most
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.420]   important.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:45.900]   I'm not going to sit around and waste 40 years of my life just thinking about the money without
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.940]   realizing the fact that I'm going to die and all the money is going to be left here.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.900]   That's why Jesus taught, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.780]   rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:03.660]   But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.940]   thieves do not break in and steal.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:11.860]   For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:17.700]   So I want you to hope that I've been able to effectively communicate at least enough
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:23.380]   to help you to see where you're going to be when you're wealthy.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.100]   I've had various consulting calls with different people who say, "Josh, I've got more money
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.100]   than I need.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.900]   What do I do?"
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.580]   And the answer every single time, I'll save you the money, I'll be happy to consult with
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.580]   you if you want to.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.460]   The answer every single time is simple.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.660]   What do you care about?
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.020]   What change do you want to make?
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.780]   What legacy do you want to have?
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.660]   Now is there a way that you can get involved now?
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:52.800]   And is there a way that you can start putting some money there now?
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   There is.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.220]   I haven't found a single issue yet that there's not a way that can get involved.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.500]   Sometimes it's starting a new business, sometimes it's funding another entrepreneur, sometimes
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.500]   it's changing something, and sometimes it's funding a legal battle.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.860]   There are all kinds of things.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.320]   Sometimes you make money off of it.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.340]   But if you get this through your head that someday you're going to be thinking about
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   what now, what next, and you're going to look at a pile of stocks and say, "Okay, it's great.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.340]   It's money.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.340]   That's nice.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.540]   But I want something more.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.780]   I want my money to matter.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.020]   I want to do something that I care about.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.820]   I want it to make an accomplish, to be impactful.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.660]   I want it to mean something."
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.460]   That's where you're going to be if you follow this path.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.220]   Yes, you might do some things along the way.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.220]   You might travel.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.220]   Great.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:44.000]   I'm intending to take time off and take a few years off at different points throughout
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.700]   my life and do some long-term travel with my family.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.700]   That's cool.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:56.220]   But you're not going to do it for 50 years.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:00.220]   You're really not.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:05.460]   You're going to look for something that matters.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:10.500]   When you're in that stage, what you're going to be looking for is how can I invest my money
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.580]   into something that matters to me.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:22.180]   While you're working your way through these stages of financial independence, don't wait
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.620]   to figure out what you're going to do once you have more money than you need.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:33.460]   Get busy recognizing the fact that you already have more money than you need and start to
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:38.680]   invest small sums into the things that matter.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.780]   Do it intentionally.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.460]   Do it carefully.
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:46.260]   Do it with vision.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:52.860]   And then when you reach that point in time, you won't wake up desperate to say, "I don't
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.900]   know how to give my money away."
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.860]   You'll be very, very practiced and you'll know the things that work and the things that
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:04.060]   won't and you'll be able to ensure that the money that you've spent so much time building
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:15.100]   and being a good steward of is allocated responsibly and productively and that it's used for good
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.100]   and not for evil.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.100]   That's it.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.100]   That's all I've got.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:23.540]   Again, forgive me if this wasn't as clear as I would like.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.620]   I've worked and worked on this and I feel a little bit...
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:33.500]   Well, I'll put it out there and let you decide.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.820]   I hope it's useful to you.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.460]   Thank you all for listening to the show today.

[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.580]   Tomorrow I'll be out with a Q&A show.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.500]   Sorry that the episode's been slow the last couple of weeks.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.780]   I was doing a little bit of traveling but also just struggling with a few things behind
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.740]   the scenes and I feel like I always say that I don't like to talk too much about the stuff
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:58.600]   behind the scenes just because, well, a lot of it's been challenging for me and I'm working
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.940]   to figure it out.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:05.300]   So this coming week maybe I'll talk about that and just I do intend to make more changes.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.620]   It's not meant to be cryptic.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.220]   I just wasn't prepared to go into it.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:14.060]   But in the meantime, I'm working to get some stuff done and so I know the frequency of
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.300]   the shows has suffered a little bit so bear with me.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.340]   Working as hard as I can and doing the best that I can as I learn all the new skills that
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.340]   I need.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.340]   Be back with you soon.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:23.340]   Thanks for listening.
