[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, what is the difference between unholy anger and holy anger?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   And does that difference have any application to our own lives?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   This is the question today from a listener named Renee.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I hear the phrase righteous anger used a lot, but I'm not 100% clear on what that looks like or what makes anger righteous or sinful.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   I understand that we are to feel anger towards sin.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Jesus overturned tables in his anger, but I don't think we should respond to sin by breaking things.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So how does righteous anger play itself out for the Christian?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   What does it look like towards people, towards sin, and towards the devil himself?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Well, I was much more optimistic about a righteous place for anger when I was 30 than I am now.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I have seen the destructive power of anger in relationships, especially marriage, to such a degree over the last 40, 50 years that I am far less sanguine about so-called righteous anger than I once was.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Anger is not just a relationship destroyer.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   It is a self-destroyer.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It eats up all other wholesome emotions.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   If it is not dealt with, it consumes everything in its path and leaves a woman or a man with nothing but bitterness and anger.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   They are not capable of any other emotion.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   It is either silence or anger, and it is a horrible development.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Therefore, the overwhelming message of the New Testament is, this is Colossians 3.8,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   "Put away all anger and wrath and malice," or Ephesians 4.31,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's very interesting that that word "harsh," "pikriniste," is the same root as the word "put away bitterness" in Ephesians 4, "pikria."
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And that word means, "Don't become deep, long-term, embittered, and angry with a spouse."
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   This is what kills a marriage way more often, I think, than sexual misconduct does.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And of course, there are the Proverbs. "Whoever is slow to anger has great understanding," Proverbs 14.29.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Or, "Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty," Proverbs 16.32.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Or, "Good sense makes one slow to anger," Proverbs 19.11.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And then, there's the—this is the most important thing for me—there's the pervasive Christian emphasis in the New Testament on loving our enemies,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   doing good to those who hate us, blessing those who curse us, not returning evil for evil,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and all of this because Jesus died for his enemies, died for the ungodly, died for people like me,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and prayed for his enemies while he was dying. He was not seething with anger as he died under the hand of horrific abuse and injustice.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   That's our great and most difficult calling, according to 1 Peter 2.21.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   But, we also know Scripture says that God has anger, and he's holy.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And Jesus, in Mark 3.5, looked around on them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And Paul, in Ephesians 4.26, says, "Be angry and do not sin. Don't let the sun go down on your anger."
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And James, in James 1.19, said, "Let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Therefore, put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So, Rene is right to ask about the role of holy or righteous or good anger, since clearly the Bible says there is such a thing.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   But I want to make crystal clear that I consider one of the foremost and difficult battles of the Christian life
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   not the battle to stir up righteous anger, but the battle not to be angry at all when you're not supposed to be angry.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It seems to me that the great miracle, the great miracle of the Christian life would be experiencing the wonderful secret
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   of how to obey the command, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor be put away from you."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   What a miracle that would be. What a world changer. What a marriage changer. What a parenting changer.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   What a church changer that would be.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   But let me answer Rene's question about what righteous anger might look like.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I'm going to do it negatively. I'm taking my cue from Paul's statement that we should not, not let the sun go down on our anger,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and James' statement that we should be slow to anger and that the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   The fact that James and Paul say that anger is dangerous and therefore it should come slowly and go quickly says to me,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   "Don't savor it. Don't cherish it." This is the great killer.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You feel so justified in your anger because what somebody said or did, you savor it.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You suck it like a candy and it just kills everything.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So here are my suggestions, and I'll just say them real quick, of what righteous anger is.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   One, righteous anger does not savor being angry as a means of self-vindication and self-exaltation.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   God opposes the proud.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Number two, righteous anger does not savor being angry as a kind of emotional damnation of other people.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We are to bless those who curse us, not damn them.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Number three, righteous anger does not savor being angry with no prayer or effort to heal and rectify the situation that made us angry as much as possible,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   like Romans 12, 18 says, with a view to helping those who made us angry, helping them change.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Number four, righteous anger does not savor being angry as though we ourselves were not sinners,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   as though we had not given far greater cause to God to be angry with us than anybody has given us to be angry with them.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And five, righteous anger does not savor being angry as though God were not sovereign,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   as though he cannot lift this burden from us and turn all things for his glory.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   When Paul was imprisoned in Rome, he put the emphasis not on becoming bitter and angry that his ministry had been frustrated and stopped.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Instead, he went way out of his way to show how God was turning it all for good and that what had happened to him was advancing the gospel, Philippians 1, 12.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And finally, righteous anger does not savor being angry as though God, not we, were not the judge.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   God is the judge who will one day settle all accounts with perfect righteousness so that we don't need to and shouldn't become vengeful.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   "Vengeance is mine. I will repay," says the Lord. "If your enemy's hungry, feed him," Romans 12, 19.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   But I'm going to end, Tony, I'm going to end with one more sentence.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Let me just say once more that the older I get, the more angry I am at my reflexive, self-justifying anger.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And yet, I don't think that even my anger at my anger is a very redemptive remedy.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Yeah, so important to reiterate this point at the beginning and the end.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for this really good overview on anger and its destructive power in our lives.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And I think next week, on Wednesday of next week, I believe, we're going to look more closely at anger inside of the home.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   But thank you for listening and making the podcast a part of your day or your commute or your bike ride or housework.

[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   We are going to break for the weekend now.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And on Monday, we hear from a high school student who wants to know, "Is dating in high school a waste of time?"
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I'll ask John Piper his thoughts on Monday.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   [end]
