[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.840]   Some thousands of years ago, there lived in Asia a king whose name was Croesus.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.740]   The country over which he ruled was not very large, but its people were prosperous and
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.680]   famed for their wealth.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.020]   Croesus himself was said to be the richest man in the world, and so well known is his
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.400]   name that to this day it is not uncommon to say of a very wealthy person that he is as
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.660]   rich as Croesus.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.300]   King Croesus had everything that could make him happy.
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.440]   Mansions and houses and slaves, fine clothing to wear, and beautiful things to look at.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.240]   He could not think of anything that he needed to make him more comfortable or contented.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.440]   "I am the happiest man in the world," he said.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.340]   It happened one summer that a great man from across the sea was traveling in Asia.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.880]   The name of this man was Solon, and he was the lawmaker of Athens in Greece.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.600]   He was noted for his wisdom, and centuries after his death, the highest praise that could
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.160]   be given to a learned man was to say, "He is as wise as Solon."
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.720]   Solon had heard of Croesus, and so one day he visited him in his beautiful palace.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.440]   Croesus was now happier and prouder than ever before, for the wisest man in the world was
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.860]   his guest.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.720]   He led Solon through his palace and showed him the grand rooms, the fine carpets, the
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.940]   soft couches, the rich furniture, the pictures, the books.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.800]   Then he invited him out to see his gardens and his orchards and his stables, and he showed
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.880]   him thousands of rare and beautiful things that he had collected from all parts of the
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.480]   world.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.200]   In the evening, as the wisest of men and the richest of men were dining together, the king
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.920]   said to his guest, "Tell me now, O Solon, who do you think is the happiest of all men?"
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.800]   He expected that Solon would say, "Croesus."
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.260]   The wise man was silent for a minute, and then he said, "I have in mind a poor man
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.080]   who once lived in Athens, and whose name was Tellus.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.560]   He, I doubt not, was the happiest of all men."
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.240]   This was not the answer that Croesus wanted.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.560]   But he hid his disappointment and asked, "Why do you think so?"
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.240]   "Because," answered his guest, "Tellus was an honest man, who labored hard for many
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.720]   years to bring up his children and to give them a good education.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.400]   And when they were grown and able to do for themselves, he joined the Athenian army and
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.200]   gave his life bravely in the defense of his country.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.640]   Can you think of anyone who is more deserving of happiness?"
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.040]   "Perhaps not," answered Croesus, half choking with disappointment.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.560]   "But who do you think ranks next to Tellus in happiness?"
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.200]   He was quite sure now that Solon would say, "Croesus."
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.860]   "I have in mind," said Solon, "two young men whom I knew in Greece.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.000]   Their father died when they were mere children, and they were very poor, but they worked manfully
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.680]   to keep the house together and to support their mother, who was in feeble health.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.360]   Year after year they toiled, nor thought of anything but their mother's comfort.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.280]   When at length she died, they gave all their love to Athens, their native city, and nobly
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.600]   served her as long as they lived."
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.160]   Then Croesus was angry.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.040]   "Why is it," he asked, "that you make me of no account and think that my wealth and
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.480]   power are nothing?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.320]   Why is it that you place these poor working people above the richest king in the world?"
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:22.800]   "O king," said Solon, "no man can say whether you are happy or not until you die.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.240]   For no man knows what misfortunes may overtake you, or what misery may be yours in place
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.320]   of all this splendor."
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.900]   Many years after this there arose in Asia a powerful king whose name was Cyrus.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.320]   At the head of a great army he marched from one country to another, overthrowing many
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   a kingdom and attaching it to his great empire of Babylon.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.920]   King Croesus, with all his wealth, was not able to stand against this mighty warrior.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.720]   He resisted as long as he could.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.880]   Then his city was taken, his beautiful palace was burned, his orchards and gardens were
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.000]   destroyed, his treasures were carried away, and he himself was made prisoner.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.840]   "The stubbornness of this man Croesus," said King Cyrus, "has caused us much trouble in
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.060]   the loss of many good soldiers.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.880]   Take him and make an example of him for other petty kings who may dare to stand in our way."
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.720]   Thereupon the soldiers seized Croesus and dragged him to the marketplace, handling him
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.160]   pretty roughly all the time.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.920]   Then they built up a great pile of dry sticks and timber taken from the ruins of his once
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.100]   beautiful palace.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.640]   When this was finished, they tied the unhappy king in the midst of it, and one ran for a
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.680]   torch to set it on fire.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.520]   "Now we shall have a merry blaze," said the savage fellows.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   "What good can all his wealth do him now?"
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.920]   This poor Croesus, bruised and bleeding, lay upon the pyre without a friend to soothe his
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.000]   misery.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.320]   He thought of the words that Solon had spoken to him years before, "No man can say whether
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:21.640]   you are happy or not until you die," and he moaned, "Oh Solon, oh Solon, Solon."
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.680]   It so happened that Cyrus was riding by at that very moment and heard his moans.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.000]   "What does he say?" he asked of the soldiers.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.600]   He says, "Solon, Solon, Solon," answered one.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.920]   Then the king rode nearer and asked Croesus, "Why do you call on the name of Solon?"
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.620]   Croesus was silent at first, but after Cyrus had repeated his question kindly, he told
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.800]   all about Solon's visit at his palace and what he had said.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.920]   The story affected Cyrus deeply.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:05.840]   He thought of the words, "No man knows what misfortunes may overtake you or what misery
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.800]   may be yours in place of all this splendor," and he wondered if sometime he too would lose
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.640]   all his power and be helpless in the hands of his enemies.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:24.720]   "After all," said he, "ought not men to be merciful and kind to those who are in distress?
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.920]   I will do to Croesus as I would have others do to me."
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.260]   And he caused Croesus to be given his freedom and ever afterward treated him as one of his
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.520]   most honored friends.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:44.880]   With Lego, every small brick adds up to endless hours of fun.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.480]   And Walmart's low prices on Lego sets have high rewards.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:57.240]   Lego unlocks your child's imagination while you hear...they hear...making lasting memories
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   for everyone.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.640]   "Thanks for the Lego set, Mom."
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.720]   Find Lego sets for under $30 at Walmart.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   Lego.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.720]   Small toy.
