[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.880]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.480]   And it's year end 2019.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.800]   And I've just been doing a lot of reflecting,
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.880]   lots and lots of reflecting, because I'm planning
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.440]   on changing things up in 2020.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.900]   And so in this episode, I just want
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.080]   to talk about the surprising benefits of early retirement
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.800]   I never anticipated.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.680]   So to recap, I left my full-time job in investment banking
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.120]   in 2012.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.500]   And I have in return.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.480]   And it's actually been a challenge
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.800]   to stay unemployed for this long.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.520]   In the beginning, I was fraught with doubt.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.360]   Like, well, is this the right thing
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.340]   to do at the age of 34, going into my prime earning years?
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.600]   It just didn't make sense the first year.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200]   But like everything, whatever you do,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.240]   you're going to get used to your new situation.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.160]   And you're going to figure out ways to adapt.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000]   So I had about $80,000 in gross passive income
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.280]   coming from dividend stocks, CDs, savings, and mostly
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.680]   rental property.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.200]   And I thought that was good enough.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.720]   But as I got older, I realized I needed to make more,
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.640]   because my lifestyle increased.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.280]   My wife stopped working also at the age of 34.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.240]   And that's just the normal human condition.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   As you get older, you just want to do more things, like travel
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.360]   and maybe start a family and take
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.040]   care of your elders and people that you care about.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.920]   And I know over the years, a lot of people
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.180]   have been on the fence about whether to truncate
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.000]   their careers and cut their main source of income.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.040]   And it's a really, really scary thing.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   And I also want to say that no matter how much you plan,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.320]   you can't anticipate everything.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.620]   Hence the reason for this podcast
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.720]   on the unanticipated benefits of early retirement.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.200]   So I want to go through five of the main ones.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.320]   And I think as you listen to these benefits,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.940]   it really might push you over the edge,
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.400]   because I'm reviewing that and I'm thinking to myself,
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.320]   I would retire right now if I had a job just because
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.440]   of this one benefit alone.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.040]   The first one is you might slow your aging.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.400]   What's interesting is when you're working,
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.680]   you're going to college, you're working 60 hours a week,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.720]   you start feeling some stress.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.480]   Let's be frank.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.880]   We all experience some amount of stress.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.480]   But you don't really realize how much stress and chronic pain
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.720]   you develop while you're working until you're no longer working.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.720]   So when I was 33, I started sprouting my first gray hair.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.440]   And I thought, hmm, finally the dam has broken,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.680]   because my dad's-- he started going gray and losing his hair
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.480]   in his 30s as well.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.760]   And I was thinking to myself, well, OK, that's it.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.800]   I was finally losing my youth after years
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.400]   of getting beaten down by the finance industry.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.760]   Then one morning, a year-- about a year after I retired,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.560]   I was looking at myself in the mirror,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.120]   and I noticed, hmm, no more gray hairs.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.080]   I looked.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.680]   I asked my wife to inspect me like a monkey,
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.880]   and she couldn't find anything on the top of my head either.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.960]   So I'm 42 now, and I still don't have any gray hairs.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   And my hairline has also stopped receding.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.360]   And I know this clearly, because I
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.480]   have this scar on the top left of my forehead
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.000]   that seems to get more and more prominent, or it seemed to.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.960]   And now it's just kind of there.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.040]   And so retiring early, very well,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.720]   might be one of the best ways to extend your life
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.480]   and allow you to look younger and happier.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.200]   Now, of course, I really won't know
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.920]   whether having a less stressful life
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.000]   has helped increase my life expectancy
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.440]   until after I'm dead.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.120]   But I'm telling you, folks, I think
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.120]   we internalize all our stresses that
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   manifests itself in chronic pain,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.600]   and then we just learn to suck it up and deal with it.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.640]   And I don't think that's healthy or normal.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.840]   We need a certain amount of stress,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.960]   but not so much so that we're just not
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   feeling good every single day.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.040]   So please take note.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.440]   Two, on the same lines of feeling healthier and maybe
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.400]   slowing your aging, your chronic physical pain might go away.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.160]   While I was working, I experienced
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.000]   several chronic physical ailments--
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.200]   TMJ, which is tightness in your jaw, sciatica, and also
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.440]   lower back pain.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.920]   And I've had this since I was in college,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.480]   and it came here and there.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.760]   And there was one point I just couldn't walk,
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.680]   or actually I couldn't sit in a chair
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.440]   for longer than five minutes.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.480]   So I had to go buy one of those Aeron chairs that
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.920]   were like $800, and the firm wouldn't pay for it.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.440]   But now they would if I just requested.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.400]   But back then I was like, OK, I've got to do this myself.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.000]   And I just couldn't drive either for longer than 10 minutes,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.720]   because it was just so painful to sit down.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.800]   I constantly grinded my teeth in my sleep,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.040]   and I would wake up with a very, very sore jaw.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.600]   And sometimes I would grind so loudly
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.320]   that I'd wake up my wife.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.920]   Every time I would talk longer than five minutes,
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.360]   my jaw and my TMJ would flare up.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.000]   And so the pain got so bad that I went to a dental specialist
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.640]   and paid him $760 out of pocket to drill some divots
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.120]   in the back of my molar.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.920]   Think about that.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.720]   This guy was just drilling divots,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.720]   because I just had this hope, this dream,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.920]   that my jaw could close more evenly so I can get some relief.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.160]   And eventually I finally did get some relief
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.120]   in reading Dr. Sarno's Healing Back Pain.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.760]   It'll be the best $9.99 you'll ever
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.840]   spend if you have any sort of chronic pain,
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.680]   whether it's tennis elbow, lower back pain, or whatever.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.200]   The book talks about how our minds can manifest chronic pain
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.620]   to deal with the stress and anger in our daily lives.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.560]   And I really believe in this book.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.880]   It's the top book I just would give to everybody
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.600]   who has any type of pain.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.720]   So then amazingly, about 10 months into retirement,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.640]   I noticed my pain had completely gone away.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.720]   So after 13 years of living and working through chronic pain,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.960]   because I thought I had no choice,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.680]   I was miraculously pain free.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.080]   Now looking back, it's just so shocking how much I put up
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.360]   with this chronic pain in the pursuit of career progression,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.080]   money, and so forth.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.840]   So if you have pain right now, retiring early
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.240]   could be one of the best moves if you do it right
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.160]   and if you have enough investment income
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.800]   to cover your expenses.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.160]   Three, your infertility issues may clear up.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.640]   This is really, really amazing and important
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.360]   for those of you who are trying to have kids.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.280]   I think something like 20% of couples trying to have kids
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.760]   go through some type of spontaneous abortion
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.840]   or more serious abortion later down the road.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.200]   And I think it's just not talked about enough.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.880]   And it's really difficult for some couples to have kids.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.680]   They say for the average couple,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.520]   it takes about seven to eight months or seven to eight tries
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.080]   before successfully conceiving.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.640]   And it's not just about conceiving,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.120]   it's about carrying the embryo to term
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.800]   after 39 to 41 weeks.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.840]   And some folks fail during that process as well.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.840]   So it's not easy or it's not as easy as you think
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.680]   to have kids, especially if you're in your 30s
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.760]   and definitely in your 40s.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.020]   So both my wife and I worked in finance,
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.760]   a highly stressful industry that required
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.200]   60 plus hours of work weeks.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.720]   Although the money was good, we were constantly tired.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.080]   The idea of children was not top of mind
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.040]   because we didn't feel like we had any energy left to spare.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.200]   And at the end of the day,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.880]   if you can't take care of yourself,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.320]   how are you expected to take care of kids?
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.400]   And this is kind of the mantra that we've been living with
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.600]   for years and years and years.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.840]   And living in New York City and San Francisco,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.520]   it's just so expensive.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.160]   So we were just focused on trying to make as much money
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.120]   as possible in order to leave work for good.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.720]   And it wasn't until after my wife turned 32 in 2012
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.160]   that we began to contemplate seriously having children.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.560]   We had always been told that it's best to have children
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.200]   before age 35 to minimize health risks
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.840]   and maximize the chances of success.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.360]   And if you click over to the post,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.480]   you'll see this interesting chart that shows
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.520]   fertility rates really plummeting after the age of 39
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.200]   and spontaneous abortions really skyrocketing
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.480]   after the age of 39 as well.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.640]   So we tried sporadically for one year
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.800]   while she was still working with no luck.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.840]   Then we tried more purposefully the next year,
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.400]   still with no luck.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.800]   She had been pretty stressed at work
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.520]   because she had just gotten passed over for a promotion
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.040]   she thoroughly thought she deserved.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.440]   And I had never seen her so mad about her job before.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.880]   So she was stressed and she was angry.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.560]   So this is when I finally convinced her
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.240]   to finally plan her exit strategy by negotiating a severance.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.680]   And when she did, it was like the skies had parted.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.240]   She was so happy and she was so relieved.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.560]   And about a year after her retirement,
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.000]   we finally successfully conceived
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.880]   and gave birth to a baby boy.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.600]   So how much did early retirement help us conceive?
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.680]   I would say it was more than 50%
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.760]   because it allowed us to spend more time
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.920]   on our mental health and physical health.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.680]   It allowed us to be less stressed.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.600]   It allowed us to relax more, to have more time to plan.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.840]   So I would say absolutely retiring early for both of us
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.400]   helped us clear up our infertility issues
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.440]   and have a family.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.880]   Four, you might actually become wealthier.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.200]   Ha, surprise.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.680]   Depending on what part of the cycle you retire in,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.800]   there is a decent chance
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.480]   you could become wealthier in retirement.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.920]   Now, I absolutely recommend folks retire
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.720]   during a bear market instead of a bull market
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.560]   because when you're in a bear market,
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.640]   if you can retire,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.400]   that means you can live off what you got right now
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.040]   after all that hammering.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.040]   Generally speaking,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.240]   there should be mostly upside in your investments
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.800]   and things will be much, much easier.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.640]   Now, if you retire in a bull market,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.400]   which we're in right now,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.440]   the 11th year of a bull market,
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.680]   it might be a little bit dicier.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.320]   If you're expecting things to continue going
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.520]   the way they are,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.560]   I think you're gonna be in for a rude surprise
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.040]   because when you're in a bull market,
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.280]   hmm, I would say the chances of downside
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.360]   are much greater, right?
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.600]   Just complete logical sense.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.400]   But let's say you're not counting particularly on luck
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.320]   to get you wealthier in retirement.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.560]   You just have a lot of free time to do what you want.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.160]   So during our free time,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.320]   I decided to write a severance negotiation book
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.840]   and that book generates about $50,000 a year
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.200]   in passive income.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.640]   Now, $50,000 is great
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.600]   because that is about $2 million in capital
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.400]   you need to accumulate at a 4% rate of return.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.480]   So right then and there,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.640]   I feel that I've created a couple million dollars in wealth
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.880]   because I retired,
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.800]   because I did something that I thought was useful,
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.160]   helpful, and that I enjoyed.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.640]   With the extra 12 to 14 hours a day,
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.280]   I spent two to three hours a day
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.880]   writing on Financial Samurai.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.720]   And as a result,
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.840]   Financial Samurai now also generates enough online income
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.680]   where I can treat my family guilt-free
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.520]   to Filet-O-Fish at McDonald's.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.520]   And I know that's kind of silly,
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.360]   but I'm telling you,
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.280]   in the past, I couldn't get beyond the dollar menu
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.880]   because it's a dollar for a cheeseburger,
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.720]   a dollar for whatever special it is that day.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.440]   I'm not gonna spend four and a half times
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.560]   to get a Filet-O-Fish,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.680]   but I love Filet-O-Fish,
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.600]   so I would treat myself maybe once a month,
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.880]   once a quarter, or something like that.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.520]   But now it's like, okay,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.520]   I'm gonna ball out, get in there,
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.400]   get two Filet-O-Fish, maybe some fries,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.120]   okay, $1 menu fries,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.920]   and then leave paying about 10 bucks.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.440]   So we fully expected our net worth to stay flat
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.240]   or even decline after we both left our jobs,
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.880]   but it's grown.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.760]   A lot of it is luck,
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.600]   but a lot of it is also
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.200]   because we are doing things that we like to do.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.320]   All right, finally,
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.800]   here's something I did not anticipate.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.760]   You may appreciate full-time work again.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.400]   It's been almost eight years since I had a full-time job.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.000]   And man, I tell you,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.560]   I'm longing to kind of get back in that grind,
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.720]   to be a part of a team,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.960]   to create something cool,
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.040]   to make some money,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.840]   to get some health benefits.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.200]   During the last weekend of my employment,
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   I ran into a huge roadblock,
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.320]   and you will run into this huge roadblock as well
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.720]   if you don't listen very carefully right now.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.600]   When you're leaving,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.920]   it's customary to clean up your files
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.880]   and to send old things back,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.400]   whether it's in your personal email
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.520]   or you just carry a box, whatnot.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   Well, I made a mistake of emailing
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.680]   a confidential client file
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.080]   back to my personal email address.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.000]   And guess what?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.720]   HR tracks everything during transition
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.520]   because HR wants to protect the company instead of you.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.760]   Think about this, please.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.800]   Know this.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.360]   Human Resources, the department,
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.000]   is out there to protect the company
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.240]   from lawsuits and everything.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.200]   And you are secondary, folks.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.400]   Given you are secondary,
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.720]   don't divulge your deepest, darkest secrets
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.680]   and your frustrations and your fears to your HR manager
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.800]   because the HR manager will inevitably tell your boss
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.120]   or your boss's boss and put you at risk,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.760]   and they're gonna start a file on you.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.720]   So please be careful on who you trust,
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.440]   especially in HR.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.320]   But if you can skillfully befriend your HR head
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.880]   or someone high up in the HR department,
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   do so because that will help you during your exit period.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.960]   So I thought my severance package was doomed
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.080]   because I had sent this private file
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.480]   to my personal email address and it was flagged by HR.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.920]   And they said, "Sam, we're gonna have to get back to you
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.000]   on your severance package
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.320]   because you violated one of our terms of agreement."
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.280]   And I thought to myself, "Oh my goodness,
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.280]   I cannot believe I screwed myself."
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.440]   'Cause that was a Friday.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.400]   And I was just like, "Oh my gosh, please, please,
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.200]   please let me not screw myself."
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.880]   And I looked at what file I had sent
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.560]   and it was a five-year-old file.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.400]   And so I was thinking to myself,
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.200]   "Well, at least it was a five-year-old file."
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.440]   It was like client contact information and stuff like that.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   And I just kept on telling them,
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.000]   "Look, I did this not on purpose.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.760]   I don't plan to stay in the industry
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.200]   or bring this information to a competitor.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.800]   Please, folks, this was a honest mistake.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.640]   Please forgive me."
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.760]   And they said, "Look, we'll get back to you."
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.200]   So as you can imagine, I mean,
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.680]   this severance package was worth over a half a million
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.120]   dollars because it paid out all my deferred compensation
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.120]   in terms of stock and it gave me a severance
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.200]   and all this stuff, right?
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.080]   So over the weekend,
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.440]   I went to the Hastings School of Law Community Fair
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   where their law students and law professors
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.000]   helped address any legal concerns
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   and questions residents had for free.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.120]   It was their way of providing community service.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.040]   And it was awesome because it was just different types
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.080]   of legal issues, helping different types of people.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.480]   And my wife and I, we stood in line for two hours
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.160]   and I kept on telling myself while I was in line,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.400]   "If I can get through this and get my severance package,
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.720]   I promise I will never, ever go back
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.800]   to corporate America again.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.120]   I swear, I swore it."
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.360]   And right now, eight years later, I'm thinking to myself,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.320]   "God, I wanna get back to corporate America
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.640]   because I need to feel alive again
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.840]   and I need to make some money and provide for my family."
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.000]   And so it's really interesting that once you've tasted
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.160]   the sweet nectar of financial freedom,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.560]   you think you never wanna return to work again,
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.640]   but things change because financial targets
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.920]   are always moving.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.520]   And here's the other thing.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.920]   Once you've had that long of a break,
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.280]   you just get accustomed to it.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.320]   It's just like everything.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.040]   Think about back when you were in school
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.600]   and you had a two or three month summer vacation.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.200]   I don't know about you, but after three months,
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.920]   I was dying to go back to school,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.240]   even though there was homework
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   and stressful exams and so forth.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.080]   I just wanted to see my friends
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.160]   and see what I could learn and play tennis
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.680]   and all that good stuff.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.560]   And it wasn't like just staying at home
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.680]   and relaxing and watching TV and stuff was the best.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.800]   It just got boring after a while.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.840]   So I've been out for almost eight years
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.440]   and I'm looking for a change.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.640]   And that's why in 2020 and beyond,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.360]   I'm gonna have a different type of writing style
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.040]   and I think a different adventure to bring you guys on.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.560]   And I think it's gonna be really, really fun.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.640]   So I hope you guys stick with me and stick it out.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   In conclusion, I wanna say that retiring early is scary,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.920]   but it is really great if you do it properly.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   I've seen too many people retire early
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.440]   only to feel extremely stressed
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.640]   because they underestimated how much they needed
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.800]   in retirement or they overestimated how much joy
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.680]   they'd experience with all their free time.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.080]   You just never know until you do it.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.680]   But I will say that you need enough assets
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.800]   to generate enough investment income
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.440]   to cover your desired life's living expenses
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.400]   plus an extra buffer.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.120]   I think that extra buffer should be about 20%.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.000]   So if living off $100,000 a year
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.360]   in gross investment income makes you happy,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.320]   then it's probably best to generate
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.520]   about $120,000 a year in investment income.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.400]   And to generate $120,000 a year in gross investment income
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.920]   requires $3 million of investments
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.480]   generating a 4% rate of return.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.440]   So I know many, many folks who think,
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.400]   "Oh, I've retired, I'm good."
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.200]   But then they spend like 10 hours a day
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.800]   trying to figure out how to make more money
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.400]   to cover their desired lifestyle
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.760]   because they didn't plan properly.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.800]   Don't be in such a rush to retire early
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.600]   because you hear other people retiring early.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.960]   You need to really plan thoroughly.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.880]   And please, please don't quit your job, folks.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.280]   I'm trying to get this message out as best as I can.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.120]   If you're gonna try to retire early and leave
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.960]   and not come back,
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.280]   you might as well try to negotiate a severance
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.800]   because there is no downside to trying to negotiate.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.920]   The last thing you wanna do
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.520]   is sacrifice your working life to retire early
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.720]   and then sacrifice your retirement life
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.120]   by living in or near abject poverty.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.840]   It makes no sense.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.120]   Instead, it's a much better route
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.560]   to find a more enjoyable job and delay retirement.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.520]   Live a little, you know, a little balance here and there.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.320]   For me, it was not that balance, okay?
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.240]   I was like, "Go, go, go in my 20s and early 30s.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.960]   "Get out and then like see what's up in the world.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.040]   "Relax a little bit."
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.320]   Right on Financial Sam right now, it's like,
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.160]   "Okay, maybe things need some changing."
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   So I hope these five unanticipated surprises
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.360]   about early retirement
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.560]   help you make a more informed decision.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.200]   It's a great, great adventure.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.120]   Treat life as an adventure.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.440]   You're never gonna get everything right.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.680]   Just do your best.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.440]   Try to plan for the future.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.160]   Expect some curveballs, twists and turns.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.000]   But I think everything is gonna be all right.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.480]   So I hope you guys have a great rest of the holiday.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.720]   And I will definitely be in touch
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.400]   because I've got so much to talk about
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.240]   and write about in 2020.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.320]   Thanks so much, folks.
