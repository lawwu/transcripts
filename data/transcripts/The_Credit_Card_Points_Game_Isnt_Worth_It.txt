[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.880]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.680]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.680]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.680]   I'm your host.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:20.000]   Today, we're going to dip our toes over into the more seductive, more alluring, the sexier
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.520]   side of personal finance.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.680]   In that, we are going to speak today about credit card points and mileage games and hotel
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680]   points, etc.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.520]   I'm going to share with you why I think that for most people, this credit card points game
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.240]   is basically worthless, and in some cases, worse than worthless.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.100]   I am, however, going to tell you the specific people for whom not only is this credit card
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.880]   points game not worthless, but in fact, it's extremely profitable and it is well worth
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.440]   considering.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.200]   Let's begin with a little bit of background.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.340]   In order for you to understand the current iteration of the credit card points game,
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.680]   etc., you need to understand the history of the industry.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.640]   I'm not going to lay out a hardcore history of the credit card industry, but rather just
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.240]   start by the integration of credit cards with airline mileage point programs, etc.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.000]   First, businesses have, for a very long time, understood the power of some kind of loyalty
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   program.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.320]   One of the four ways that a business can increase its revenue is to increase the number of purchases
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.700]   from a specific customer per year or per month or whatever.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.240]   If you have a customer that ordinarily comes into your business once or twice a month,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.540]   and you can instead get that customer to come in three or four times a month, that makes
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.960]   an enormous impact on your revenue over the course of the business.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.920]   Businesses have figured this out.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.880]   We've all seen very simple loyalty programs where you get a little card from your favorite
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.320]   local submarine sandwich shop, and they say, "Buy 10 subs, get the 11th free," or your
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.000]   local car wash will give you a card and say, "Get 10 car washes, get the 11th free," things
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   like that.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.160]   These are all basic forms of loyalty programs, and these made their way into the airline
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.880]   industry at the very end of the 1970s, beginning of the 1980s, when airlines figured out if
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.400]   we could somehow figure out how to incentivize people to fly with us on our airline, then
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.880]   we could get them to more frequently choose us instead of our competitors.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.800]   You have the concept of a mileage account, and with the early airline programs, it was
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.120]   relatively simple and straightforward.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.640]   Let's say you flew 10 different 1,000-mile flights.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.800]   That earned you 10,000 miles, and they would have a chart that says, "Once you've accumulated
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   10,000 miles on our airline, that qualifies you for a free ticket, and you can redeem
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.000]   your 10,000 miles balance with us for a free airplane flight or a couple of free airplane
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   flights."
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.560]   I think these became very popular and were promoted significantly by the business community
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.480]   because they formed a really nice perk, a non-taxable job perk.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.280]   You might have a businessman who flies constantly for work.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.600]   His employer is paying for all of those trips, but every mile he flies for work, he gets
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   points in his mileage balance because those points are awarded to the actual flyer who's
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.760]   on the airplane, not to the payer, the business, who pays for the flight.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.860]   Due to a nice little loophole in the internal revenue code in the United States, these are
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.760]   just free non-taxable job perks.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.400]   For a lot of guys, especially some guy who might be a road warrior in many cases, he
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.000]   could send his entire family on a luxury airplane flight vacation with luxury hotels based entirely
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.160]   upon the points that he earned from flying and staying in hotels on his business trips.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.000]   As airlines were looking for a pathway to increase their revenue, and the credit card
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.920]   business itself started to grow, then in about the mid to late '80s, you started to see an
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.360]   integration of part of airlines and hotels partnering together with credit cards.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.280]   They would offer people the ability to purchase an airline-branded credit card or the ability
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.080]   to sign up for a credit card and get a certain bonus.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.800]   Today, these credit card programs have fundamentally transformed the entire airline industry in
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.080]   the United States, where not only does the company itself generate an enormous amount
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.780]   of revenue from these credit card programs, but also the entire airline has been restructured
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.160]   to cater to these programs.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.960]   I follow a guy who has traveled enormously, is in the midst of starting an airline, etc.,
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   and he's a European guy.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.560]   One of the things that's interesting is every time he's in the United States, all he wants
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.320]   to do is complain about how the entire experience of first-class travel in the United States
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.840]   has been destroyed by the credit card system, because what has happened is instead of you
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.640]   gaining access to a first-class lounge or a business-class lounge because you paid for
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.200]   a proper first-class or business-class seat, now those lounges are jam-packed with aspirational
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.400]   travelers who are in there because of their American Express Platinum card or their status
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.520]   based upon a credit card purchase, and it's completely transformed the entire experience
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.080]   of travel, especially first-class and business-class travel.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.140]   I'm not here to partake in that whining and complaining.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.680]   After all, with the number of airplane tickets that I buy, I wind up on more budget airlines
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.640]   than I would prefer sometimes, but the point is that these credit card programs have experienced
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.400]   an enormous – have had an enormous impact on the industry at large.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.120]   Now, when I first started to pay attention to this myself was at the early days of the
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.600]   credit card hacking industry, and the Internet enabled us to communicate about all kinds
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480]   of esoteric topics, and because of my interest in personal finance, I was always attracted
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.460]   to this one, and I was an early subscriber to Chris Guillebeau's newsletters and – I
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.920]   mean, there are a lot of people before him, but that's just the name that I remember
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.880]   from back in that era, and basically, people would come together and they figured out how
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.920]   to game the system a little bit, and gaming the system, putting it very simply, involves
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:47.120]   signing up for lots and lots of credit cards in order to get substantial sign-up bonuses,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.680]   spending lots of money on those credit cards in order to satisfy the minimum spending requirements
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.320]   of your initial sign-up bonus, as well as to accumulate points in an advantaged way,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.800]   and then exploiting those points and redeeming them for first-class flights, really wonderful
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.920]   peak experiences, things like that.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.800]   And because of the ability of these communities to share information, the tactics and techniques
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.280]   advanced very quickly.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   Just by way of illustration, there was a time where there was a very short window when there
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.200]   were people that were buying coins directly from the U.S. Mint on their credit cards,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.840]   and they're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on their credit cards in order
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.560]   to generate points, and then getting those coins and then, I guess, reselling them – I
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.960]   can't remember what they did with them – but putting them in the bank, et cetera.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.840]   And so there have always been ways to basically game the system, and those ways have been
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.160]   shared around these Internet communities very, very quickly.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.440]   And today, the tactics and the techniques are quite advanced.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.960]   There are many, many educators out there who have large, thriving brands of content and
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.080]   education devoted to teaching people how to maximize these programs, what cards to sign
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.200]   up for, how to make the whole system work, how to redeem them, et cetera.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.400]   There's many different angles to it.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.960]   And this is something that has always been an interest of mine.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   After all, it's perfectly congruent with my brand.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.180]   This is radical personal finance, how to get free stuff.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:29.640]   And I have partaken of this off and on throughout the years to different levels, and it is this
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.320]   experience that has led to my forming the perspectives that I'm now going to share
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   with you.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.160]   The problem is that I don't think that most people really are served by these programs.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.960]   There are some obvious objections.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.760]   For example, the most obvious objection is if you find yourself carrying credit card
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   balances and paying significant amounts in interest, then these programs are never going
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   to pay off for you.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.720]   And most of the educators in this space, people who have large brands, say that up front.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.760]   If you're the kind of person who carries credit card balances, don't do this because
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.320]   it's going to wind up getting you into trouble.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.320]   And I think that's good advice.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.520]   So if you're the kind of person who carries credit card balances, you will not make up
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.640]   for the amount of money that you spend in interest with some free points and free hotel
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   stays.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.080]   That's the first thing.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.080]   There are other objections though that don't apply.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.480]   So for example, some people think, "Oh, it's all a scam."
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.920]   It's not a scam.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.240]   It is absolutely something that works.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.920]   You can take free flights.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.960]   I have booked various free flights.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.720]   You can take free hotel stays.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.280]   I've stayed in free hotel stays, et cetera.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.080]   Those things are there.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.120]   The biggest problem that I have with it is that there is an enormous amount of learning
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.120]   that has to be done in order to exploit these programs at the highest possible level.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.640]   And this learning is really significant.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.040]   It's very, very time consuming.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.160]   I'm not an ignorant person in the world of personal finance.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:15.080]   I grasp most things related to personal finance pretty quickly and I learn things fairly easily.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.840]   Over the last couple of years, as I have dug back into this space and as I do with all
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.920]   of the stuff that I talk about, really worked hard to test everything for myself.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.440]   As I started hacking the credit card game and applying for new offers and accumulating
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.760]   points and et cetera, I was amazed at how complicated this space has become.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.080]   Because there's this constant cat and mouse game between the credit card offers and the
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.680]   world of credit card hackers.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.280]   And the offers are designed to appeal to as many people as possible, but then the hackers
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:55.640]   come along and abuse the offers until they have to make the offer a little bit less sweet.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.040]   And so the value of my observation is that the whole industry is not nearly as easy as
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.280]   it was 10 years ago.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.560]   It's not to say it can't still be done, but it's not as easy as it was 10 years ago.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:15.240]   The signup bonuses are, even if the nominal value point, the number of miles that you
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.880]   receive on a nominal basis may be large and higher, the actual value of those miles has
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.000]   changed dramatically.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.360]   And the airlines are always jiggering with their mileage award charts, and they're always
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.640]   jiggering with their alliances, and they're always jiggering with their dates and the
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.800]   tools et cetera to use it.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.200]   And so it's extremely complicated.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:41.040]   And what most people don't understand is that accumulating the miles is the easy part.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.760]   It's not difficult if today you wanted to go and join the airline miles game, it's not
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.040]   difficult for you to go and by three or four months from now have a few hundred thousand
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.720]   miles in your accounts as long as you have an adult sized financial life and you can
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.240]   meet the minimum spending requirements.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.360]   However, that's only half of it.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.160]   The other half of it is the redemption.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.640]   And this for me has been the biggest disappointment for my own situation.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.520]   For example, when I fly, I don't, generally if I'm flying alone, I'm flying on business.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.160]   And so ordinarily I wouldn't use award travel for that, rather I would just book flights
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.680]   and deduct them as business expenses properly.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.500]   So if I'm going to use award travel, I generally want to do award travel with my family.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.040]   But due to the size of my family, it's often difficult to find the appropriate number of
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.920]   award tickets.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.860]   Now I understand that I have an unusually large family in today's world when I'm buying
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.640]   seven airplane tickets, but even if you're buying four airplane tickets, you still have
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.320]   a similar problem.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:57.000]   And the biggest, like the most advantageous redemptions with using miles usually comes
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.840]   with purchasing business class or first class travel.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.160]   That's where most of the best, that's where you get the most attraction.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.560]   If you go on and you try to find somebody who's teaching you about the mileage and points
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.060]   game, what's going to attract you I think is the idea that look, you can get two business
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.100]   class seats to the Maldives and you can fly all the way there and back in business class
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.560]   with look at this great deal I got and look at this amazing over the water bungalow that
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.360]   I booked for X number of thousand points, and isn't this an incredible experience?
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.720]   Well yes, it is, if you are one person or two people flying together, because you can
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.280]   frequently find one or two seats in business class as award travel.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:43.200]   It's much more difficult if not impossible to book seven business class seats on one
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.720]   airplane ticket or one flight.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.160]   I have not been able to successfully do that.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:55.440]   I have with some of the new tools that are now available, have been able to find seven
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.840]   seats and get seven seats on economy class, but not on business class.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.200]   Speaking of tools, there was one tool that was an incredible value for me, and that tool
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.240]   it may be for you as well, because I accumulated massive numbers of points.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.680]   And then I could not figure out how to redeem them properly, and I signed up for various
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.920]   courses and various educators and whatnot.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:28.760]   It wasn't until sometime back I discovered the tool of seats.aero, s-e-a-t-s.a-e-r-o,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.760]   seats.aero, which is a little web tool that somebody has built that allows you to find
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:39.240]   award travel seats that are available from all the different airlines systems.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:45.360]   And that saved me, because now I was able to, using that tool, I was able to search
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:53.280]   for seven airline seats and only look at the airlines that had the appropriate amount of
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   space.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   And that's what allowed me to start using points on airline travel.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.160]   By the way, even this tool, if you go to seats.aero, you can use some of it for free.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.120]   I have a paid account, paid subscription to it, but you can use a lot of it for free.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.680]   And one of the things that you'll quickly find out is you'll see the complexity of it.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.840]   For example, in order to properly redeem your points, one of the tools and tactics that
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.640]   you need to learn is that you frequently need to redeem your points with a partner airline
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.800]   of the airline that you actually want to fly on, and it's not on the airline that you're
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.320]   redeeming them for.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.440]   So recently I was redeeming some points, let's see, what was it?
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.600]   I was booking for an Air France flight on Delta, which is a pretty simple example.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:47.440]   I was booking on Delta for an Air France flight, and then I was booking on Air Canada for a
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.000]   Turkish Airways flight.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.720]   Things like that are very normal.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.080]   And so you frequently have to book on an alliance partner in order to get things, and it takes
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.840]   quite a lot of time to figure this stuff out, figure out where would I like to stay, what
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.720]   would I like to do, et cetera.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.980]   The next thing that's a limitation for a lot of people is it's going to be very difficult
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:14.120]   for you to use these travel experiences for their maximum value if you have any kind of
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.180]   constraints on your schedule.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:22.840]   So what really works the best is if I'm one or two people, and I'm open to any kind of
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.700]   peak experience, and I can just browse around using a tool like seats.arrow, and I can see,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.500]   hey, where can I get great redemptions, and oh, that'd be fun.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.460]   Let me go and fly to that place, and let's go and fly business class there.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.140]   And that's perfectly fine, by the way.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.140]   That's what I teach.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.940]   If you want to travel the world for cheap, then one of the basic secrets is figure out
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.940]   where it's cheap to go, and then figure out what's interesting to do there.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.820]   And the same principle applies to booking award travel, figuring out where you can get
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.900]   a great redemption for a great experience, and then figure out what you want to do there.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:01.460]   What's much more difficult is to book a specific place on a specific schedule.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.860]   So I want to be at this city on these dates, and I want this hotel to work out, and I want
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.020]   these airlines to work out.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:13.260]   Very rarely are you ever going to be able to accomplish the full booking process all
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.900]   based on your points.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.380]   Very rarely are you going to be able to get the airline reward redemption on the date
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.660]   that you want, in the class of travel that you want, to the specific place that you want,
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.780]   and the hotel that you want as available, and have it all line up.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.220]   So frequently, you're going to be using your points to fill in one or two of those pieces,
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.740]   and then you're going to put one or two of those pieces just under normal, normal constraints.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:42.420]   And okay, that's not such a terrible thing, but it's annoying and frustrating.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.160]   And those are some of the biggest issues that I've had.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.060]   Similar thing, by the way, to booking airplane seats occurs with booking hotels.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.340]   Let's say I want to book a hotel reservation.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.700]   I find it incredibly easy to use up all my hotel points when I'm traveling by myself.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.700]   That's no problem.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.060]   Or if I'm just traveling with my wife or one or two people, no problem, because then everything
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.060]   works easy.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.060]   I want to book a reward.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.060]   I need a standard room.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:14.140]   If the standard room has a bed with, you know, it's a double room for two people, sometimes
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.660]   four people, et cetera, then that's no problem.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.540]   I can book it with points frequently.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.580]   Problem is that a lot of times, again, those are business trips, and those are trips that
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.960]   I would prefer just to pay for, and I'd like to save my points for my personal consumption.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.580]   But then when we go to personal consumption, then I need multiple rooms, and it can be
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.220]   difficult on various hotel platforms to book multiple rooms, or they're not available on
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.900]   the dates that I want, et cetera.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.740]   And so it's just very difficult for my logistics to make that work.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.340]   And sorry, it sounds like I'm whining.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.340]   I'm not whining.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.500]   I'm just sharing with you what I've learned, because this does kick in at anywhere.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.140]   If you have two children and you're a family of four, I think you'll experience these same
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.220]   things.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.180]   I have not found – I'm sure they're probably out there, but I haven't looked for them either.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:06.980]   But very frequently, the most active teachers on this subject are usually a single guy or
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.760]   gal or a couple.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.140]   And so all of their travel is done as two people, where the world is very – the world
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.660]   of mileage, redemption awards, et cetera, is very friendly to them.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.060]   When I've had to figure out how to make some of this stuff work with many more people,
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.300]   I've found it much more difficult.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.580]   Doesn't mean that it's not possible.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.580]   I've learned a lot.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:31.980]   I mean, I've considered making my own course on the subject, and someday maybe I will.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.300]   It's not the highest priority for me, but who knows.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.980]   It can work out and it can provide some cool ways to get some peak experiences, but it's
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.980]   difficult.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.460]   Now, what's the biggest problem with it?
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.180]   My biggest problem with the whole system is the opportunity cost.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:55.140]   And lest I sound like an endlessly scratched record, I am, because the biggest problem,
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.300]   the biggest cost for most of the things that we do is the opportunity cost, and I think
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:07.180]   that mileage hacking and mileage, et cetera, the whole deal, it's very much associated
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.180]   with this.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:15.820]   So recently, I booked a very complicated trip that I'm planning to take, and I'm going
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:21.860]   to not share any of the details for the moment, but a very complicated international trip.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.460]   And I spent, in order to book that trip, I had all the miles, trying to use the miles,
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.460]   et cetera.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:35.860]   It took me something like 18 hours of work over the course of about two or three weeks
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:41.900]   to get this done, 18 hours just to book this trip.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.020]   And I think I said it was a complicated trip.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.900]   I booked it as a complicated trip, but it was complicated because it took so many iterations
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.820]   to figure out a version of the trip that I was happy with, of the destinations that I
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.500]   wanted to visit, all of the accommodations, et cetera.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.580]   And that was just 18 hours for one trip.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:03.500]   Now what is the cost to me of that 18 hours of time versus the benefit?
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.940]   Well, the benefit is I was able to use my points.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.940]   Great.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.340]   But were the points free?
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.220]   No, they certainly weren't free.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.580]   There's a cost to accumulating the points, et cetera.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:20.180]   And then using them, it was such a frustrating experience that it just made me wish I'm
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.460]   just going to pay for everything.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:29.020]   And when I think about the amount of time that I've spent investing into the redeeming
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.140]   the stuff, figuring out the rules, figuring out the airlines, checking here, checking
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.940]   there, trying to get the best deal, the best value, et cetera, I just look at it and I'm
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.420]   pretty scandalized by it.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.760]   And I think, Joshua, just make more money.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.640]   What an idiot you are for spending all this time trying to play this game.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.920]   Just make more money.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.820]   And make more money and afford to go and buy yourself seven business class seats because
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:56.860]   you can buy seven business class seats, you just can't redeem seven mileage award seats.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.260]   And that, I think, is the biggest thing that most people don't reflect on.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:07.180]   The time commitment for this world of mileage hacking, et cetera, is enormous to learn it
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.400]   and to do it and to practice it on an ongoing basis.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.780]   It has to be genuinely a hobby that you enjoy.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.620]   Going and searching for flights and checking this website, that website, this tool, that
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.340]   tool, et cetera, figuring out where could I go this month, where could I go next month,
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:28.400]   and just doing that, it has to be something that you enjoy, something that's relaxing
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.140]   to you, sitting on the couch watching TV and you're just goofing off on the laptop looking
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.120]   for valuable redemption awards.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.920]   The average person who doesn't have that kind of interest and isn't going to do it, I don't
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.560]   think is well served by this system because it's too time consuming for you to go and
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:50.360]   accumulate the knowledge necessary and then to know how to even go through and accomplish
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.640]   the redemptions.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:57.560]   The complexity of the whole system, the complexity of accumulating the points and doing this
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.400]   program and tracking my minimum spend, okay, where can I get another $3,000 of spending?
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.560]   And then I'm going to put this into this program, I'm going to have my American Express points,
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.840]   I'm going to have my ultimate rewards points, I'm going to have my Capital One points, I'm
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   going to have, okay, this is going to go to this program, now there's a mileage bonus,
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   let me go ahead and, the complexity of it eats up enormous amounts of time and it has
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.840]   to be a hobby.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:23.680]   And if you actually look at the actual value that you get from it, is that really a good
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.120]   value of the time?
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.820]   What if you had something better to do with the time?
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.560]   What if you had some way to invest that time to make more money, to do something more interesting
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.520]   with your time and with your ability?
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   In addition, there is, and I'm going to quickly come to who this is right for, but one more
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.600]   thing to point out.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:52.320]   Frequently you're dealing with, because you're going after the luxury experiences in many
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:24:00.760]   cases, frequently you are dealing with not the best option.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.640]   What I mean is, let's say you go to, I don't know, booking.com, you're going to travel
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.360]   to Paris, France, and you go to booking.com and you are going to choose a hotel.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:15.600]   Well, a site like booking.com will serve you thousands and thousands of different options,
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.160]   from the most luxurious to the least luxurious, et cetera.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.340]   You can choose among those options.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:27.040]   If you've got your credit card points, then you are restricted to the partner to which
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.200]   you can transfer those points.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.480]   Maybe it's Hyatt or Hilton or Marriott, those are the big ones, Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.040]   and IHG are your big ones.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.680]   Don't get me wrong, I really like these hotel chains.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:46.320]   One of the things that in my own travel planning, whenever possible, I avoid flying on American
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.000]   flagged carriers.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.200]   I avoid Delta and United and American Airlines whenever possible in favor of some foreign
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   brand.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.600]   I'd rather fly on Korean Air or Singapore Air or Turkish Airways, et cetera, because
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.520]   I find that you get better service on non-American flagged airlines.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.080]   However, I personally prefer to stay at American flagged hotels.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.680]   If I have the choice, I'd rather stay at a Marriott or at an IHG or Hyatt or something
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.800]   like that, in many cases, rather than a small independent hotel, because you get a different
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.640]   level of service.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.120]   I don't know why there's that difference, but at least it's something I've noticed and
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.320]   I would bet other people have as well.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.120]   That I would rather fly on a non-American flagged carrier in order to stay at an American
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.480]   flagged hotel chain versus the opposite.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.760]   But still, you're just getting one certain thing.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.960]   Now with the portfolio of brands that each of these companies has, you can often find
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.680]   the kind of experience that you're looking for.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.160]   But the point is that you're often locked in and the same thing happens with airlines.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.760]   If you are flying for money, you have all the same searching ability that you can do
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.040]   and you can often find all kinds of inexpensive fares that are available for you, either due
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.720]   to better competition on that route and/or etc.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:11.920]   Just better competition on the route or more mistake fares or their sales.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.280]   All the same things apply to finding great airfare deals.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:21.240]   It's just a simpler, more straightforward system to spend less time finding a good deal
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.320]   on the kind of hotel that you want to stay at and the kind of airline that you want to
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:30.360]   fly on, rather than spending all the money and the time to deal with the points.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.360]   So who is a good fit for these mileage programs?
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.440]   Well, as far as I'm concerned, there are a few no-brainers.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.120]   So the first one that's an absolute no-brainer is simply this.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.920]   If you have some kind of significant ongoing expenses, usually expenses associated with
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.200]   your business, and you can pay for those expenses with a credit card, and there's no cheaper
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.680]   way for you to get those expenses covered with another form of payment, well, then you
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.780]   are a perfect fit for a mileage program.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:10.360]   So if you buy hundreds of thousands of dollars per year of Facebook ads and Twitter ads and
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.440]   things like that, or if you run a contracting business and you spend hundreds of thousands
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:21.200]   of dollars a year renting equipment, things like that, or if you purchase supplies for
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.280]   customer projects, you're renovating houses and you purchase tens of thousands of dollars
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.640]   of building supplies, which you then bill your client for, you are a perfect fit for
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:37.200]   a points credit card, because you'll have so much spending that just the natural value
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.400]   of the points, you'll accumulate enormous quantities of them.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.760]   And if you have enormous quantities of the points, and it's basically "free," then you
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.620]   don't have to spend all your time going through and trying to figure out how to maximize every
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.440]   single redemption.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.140]   It's perfectly reasonable for you.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.600]   If you earn hundreds of thousands of points per year just naturally, it's perfectly reasonable
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.800]   for you to pop open Delta Airlines and say, "I want to go here on those dates.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.440]   Oh, look, pay with points."
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.680]   And it's perfectly reasonable for you to pop open Marriott.com and, "Hey, look, I want
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.480]   this number of rooms," and boom, pay with points, done.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.080]   It works fine.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:19.640]   You're not in any way maximizing the system, but you are a good candidate for those kinds
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:26.360]   of programs, just because your built-in spending to the business allows you to accumulate points.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.720]   And those points are probably more valuable to you for those luxury experiences and those
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.880]   tax-free perks and things like that than would be something like a cashback option that just
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.120]   adds a little bit more profit that you probably don't need.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:47.200]   The second person for whom this is really appropriate is somebody who's an aficionado.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:52.280]   So if you are a single person or a couple or maybe a family of three and you really
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.920]   enjoy this and it's something that you do as kind of a relaxing thing, then yeah, this
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.500]   is a good fit for you because you'll go through the learning process, you'll learn all the
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.860]   ways to exploit it, maximize it, you'll learn all the loopholes to redeeming them, and you'll
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:12.680]   be able to create some luxury experiences that you wouldn't otherwise have.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.200]   That really is true, and it is possible for people.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.080]   But it needs to be your hobby, and this leads me to kind of the cross between the second
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080]   and the third person.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:27.280]   I think the third person for whom this is a good fit is somebody who just doesn't have
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.560]   other money-making opportunities.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:40.120]   Let's say, for example, that you and your wife are both college professors, and you
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   just love it.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.400]   You love teaching, you like your lifestyle, and this is what you're going to do, and you
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:50.360]   don't have any interest in trying to do a side business and becoming the next Andrew
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.000]   Huberman or something like that.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.920]   You're just focused on, "We like teaching our classes, and this is what we do."
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:02.040]   Well, in that situation, your income is not infinitely scalable.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.040]   You're not going to go out and spend your time working on a side hustle to make more
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.040]   money.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.040]   You're not an entrepreneur.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.520]   You have a stable, fixed income and a good lifestyle associated with it.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.520]   Perfectly fine.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.880]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.240]   But the acknowledgement is, unlike me, who if I had invested those 18 hours into something
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.600]   else, I certainly could have made a lot more money than redeeming my points made for me.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.800]   You have a different system.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.240]   You have a different set of constraints.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:32.300]   If you have that, and you earn enough money to cover your expenses, and you're not going
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.640]   to go into debt, and you have a kind of a stable lifestyle, then this may be a way for
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:47.420]   you to just systematically acquire some points so that you can have some cool peak experiences.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.780]   It doesn't become that difficult if you have a little bit of basic knowledge.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.420]   In essence, let's say quarterly, you're going to sit down and you're going to subscribe
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:00.460]   to a couple of newsletters or check out a couple of forums or subscribe to some various
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.660]   teacher's premium program.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.060]   Every few months, you're going to make a credit card application, take out a new card, you're
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.020]   going to move your spending to that card for a few months, and you're going to accumulate
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.340]   quite a lot of points that way, and that can work well.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.540]   That's the crossover between kind of the person for whom it's a hobby.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.000]   If this is really a hobbyist of yours, okay, you can do well at it.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.020]   But I'm skeptical that most people are really getting all that much benefit from it compared
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.020]   to what is possible.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:36.460]   Because for most of us, what we're giving up to engage in that world is many more lucrative
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.460]   opportunities.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.620]   It doesn't have to be a side hustle, it doesn't have to be entrepreneurship.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.060]   But the problem with becoming an expert in the credit card points game is, unless you're
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.500]   going to build a business around being an advisor to people on credit card points, you're
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.300]   probably neglecting something else that would enhance your career more effectively, something
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:59.120]   that would allow you to improve your job skills.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.860]   With the amount of time that you spend playing with the credit card points game, you may
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:07.940]   be able to code, learn to code, and go into a completely different setup, or become the
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:12.700]   expert on artificial intelligence at your company, guiding your company to more profitability,
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.020]   or becoming world-class at some other thing.
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.420]   And that's what we need to be really cautious of, is we need to be careful that we're not
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:25.260]   paying a higher cost with our opportunity cost than we are aware of it.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.060]   If you enjoy the hunt for the deal, go for it.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:33.420]   I think in many cases, you probably should focus out more on making more money instead.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.420]   Great.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.420]   And if you have high consistent expenses that can go on credit cards, go for it.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.020]   But remember that these things may be a distraction.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:48.660]   And as I've said previously, as I reflect on 10 years of radical personal finance, one
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:54.540]   of the regrets that I have is that I spent a lot of time getting distracted with things
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:33:01.500]   that were…they seemed alluring, because they seemed like I was going to live the lifestyle
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.940]   of a millionaire without being a millionaire.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.940]   They seemed like things that I should go after, because look, I can exploit this, I can maximize
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.940]   this little loophole, I can save a little bit here, etc.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:19.180]   And I've just come to see a lot of that as wasted time and effort.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:25.840]   It's not a matter of…really great personal finance is not built upon a lifestyle of clipping
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:31.540]   a coupon here and saving a little bit there and finding some way to live like a millionaire
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.680]   without being one.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.500]   The most effective pathway is the direct one.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:44.740]   It's the direct pathway to becoming a millionaire, to making a million dollars a year, to building
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.240]   a business that can comfortably buy you all of your first-class travel and put you up
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.580]   at the first-class hotels and things like that.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:59.860]   I'm always conscious that that may not actually be open to everybody.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.220]   I'm not making fun of clipping coupons.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.660]   They serve a value.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:11.680]   But truly, we are more capable than we realize.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:21.020]   And if I had stopped years ago chasing down little things to find a loophole and get something
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:28.260]   for nothing and go a little farther, etc., and just focused on the fundamentals, then
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.100]   it would not be necessary.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.580]   None of the little deals and things would have been necessary.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:40.180]   And as I try to learn from the last 10 years and make a better plan for the next 10 years,
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:47.140]   this is at the core of where I'm at in my own business, my own personal finances, etc.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:55.580]   And I don't think I have anything to apologize for in terms of the content that I've made
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.580]   or anything like that.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.260]   I don't think I've steered anybody wrong.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:05.420]   I just didn't realize how time-consuming a lot of those things really were and how much
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.300]   better it would have been to focus on the fundamentals.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:14.860]   And a more straightforward focus on the fundamentals would have, I think, more fully paid off.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:21.980]   So now when I see people who are really interested in the credit card game, etc., I just ask
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.460]   myself, again, unless they're making money on it and they have a coaching business or
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:30.460]   whatever or programming some tool that works out and pays them money, I just ask myself,
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.100]   "Wouldn't you be better off doing something else?"
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.820]   And the answer almost every time has been yes.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:41.140]   I've never met a wealthy person who got rich because of their credit card points.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.740]   There are a significant number of wealthy people who have gotten rich talking about
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:50.140]   credit cards, selling credit cards, etc., and no problem with that because there are
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.060]   a number of people who've been able to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, a really peak experience
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.540]   because of it.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:03.960]   But on the whole, I've never met anybody who's become wealthy accumulating credit card points.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:10.220]   And even if you go to those peak experiences, you know, I watch their YouTube videos and
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.580]   whatnot, you're sitting in business class or you're sitting at the fancy oceanfront
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.300]   resort, it's not a sustainable thing.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.380]   You're out of your league.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.260]   You're out of your depth.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.940]   And if you can use credit card points to put a little fire in the belly and say, "I want
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.860]   to fly like this every time," great.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.860]   Go for it.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.460]   But at the end of the day, I think credit card points and the whole game is much more
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.920]   of a distraction than many people realize.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.180]   They're not that hard to accumulate, although it does take a little bit of practice and
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.700]   a little bit of learning, but they are difficult to redeem.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:49.860]   And the time-consuming nature of it is something that I think would send most of us in another
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.360]   direction.
