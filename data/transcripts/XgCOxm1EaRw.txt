[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]   [Silence]
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.860]   What happens when somebody has a glass,
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.860]   we always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.860]   or a cocktail after dinner or before dinner,
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.080]   how does that impact their sleep?
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.160]   And then we'll be sure to circle back
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.200]   in terms of what is reasonable ranges of behavior
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   when it comes to avoiding alcohol
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.960]   or if it's age appropriate, et cetera.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.160]   - Enjoying alcohol.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.000]   - Yeah.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.240]   So alcohol, if we're thinking about classes of drugs,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.440]   they're in a class of drugs that we call the sedatives.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.120]   And I think one of the first problems
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.880]   that people often mistake,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.020]   alcohol is often used as a sleep aid
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.840]   for people who are struggling with sleep
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.160]   when things like over-the-counter remedies, et cetera,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160]   or herbal remedies have just not worked out for them.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.800]   And alcohol, unfortunately, is anything but a sleep aid.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.760]   The first reason that most people use it
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.480]   is to try and help them fall asleep.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.200]   - And this process of this event
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.260]   that we call falling asleep,
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.920]   I have to imagine is a process.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.760]   - It is a process.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.720]   - Like everything in biology.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.080]   And that that process involves in some way,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.400]   as we talked about push-pull before,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.820]   turning off thinking, planning, et cetera,
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.060]   and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.420]   I have to imagine that these two things
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.220]   are knobs turning in opposite directions
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.400]   that gives us this outcome we call falling asleep.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.200]   Alcohol, it seems, is helpful for some people
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.520]   to turn off their thoughts or their planning.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.800]   Is that right?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.760]   - Yes, it is.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.160]   And so I think if we look at the pattern of brain activity,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.520]   if I were to place you inside an MRI scanner
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.800]   where we're looking at the activity of your brain
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.400]   and watch you drifting off,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   some parts of your brain will become less active,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   other parts will become more active.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.160]   And this is the push-pull model.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.200]   It's inhibition, excitation.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.020]   But alcohol is quite different in that regard.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.640]   Alcohol is, because it's a sedative,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.360]   what it's really doing is trying to essentially
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.000]   knock out your cortex.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.280]   It's sedating your cortex.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.400]   And sedation is not sleep.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.360]   But when we have a couple of drinks in the evening,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.000]   when we have a couple of nightcaps,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.480]   we mistake sedation for sleep, saying,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.340]   well, I always, when I have a couple of whiskeys
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.680]   or a couple of cocktails,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.460]   it always helps me fall asleep faster.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.900]   In truth, what's happening is that
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.140]   you're losing consciousness quicker,
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.560]   but you're not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.400]   any quicker.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.560]   So that's one of the first sort of things
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000]   just to keep in mind.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.480]   The second thing with alcohol
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.400]   is that it fragments your sleep.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   And we spoke about the quality of your sleep
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.600]   being just as important as the quantity.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.320]   And alcohol, through a variety of mechanisms,
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.560]   some of which are activation
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.400]   of that autonomic nervous system,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.900]   that fight or flight branch of the nervous system,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.420]   alcohol will actually have you waking up
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.500]   many more times throughout the night.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.640]   So your sleep is far less continuous.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.260]   Now, some of those awakenings
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.300]   will be of conscious recollection the next day.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.940]   You'll just remember waking up.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940]   Many of them won't be.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.060]   And so, but yet your sleep will be littered
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.980]   with these sort of punctured awakenings
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:17.940]   throughout the night.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.220]   And again, when you wake up the next morning,
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.540]   you don't feel restored by your sleep.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.360]   Fragmented sleep or non-continuous sleep
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.760]   in this alcohol-induced way
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.780]   is usually not good quality sleep
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.420]   that you feel great on the next day.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.240]   The third part of alcohol in terms of an equation
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.320]   is that it's quite potent at blocking your REM sleep,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.280]   your rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.800]   And REM sleep is critical
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.200]   for a variety of cognitive functions,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.080]   some aspects of learning and memory.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.620]   It seems to be critical for aspects
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.420]   of emotional and mental health.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.500]   - You've described it before
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.100]   as a sort of self-generated therapy
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.500]   that occurs while we sleep.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.140]   - Yeah, it's overnight therapy.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.820]   You know, it's emotional first aid.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.020]   - Certainly people that don't get enough sleep
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.720]   are very easy to derail emotionally.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.340]   Not that one would wanna do that to people,
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.460]   but we all sort of fall apart emotionally.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.260]   I always think of it as almost like our skin sensitivity
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.320]   can be heightened when we are sleep deprived.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.500]   Our emotional sensitivity is such
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.140]   that when we're sleep deprived,
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.540]   such that it takes a much finer grain of sandpaper
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.580]   to create that kind of friction.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.020]   Things bother us.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.540]   - Threshold to trigger. - Even online comments
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.580]   bother us when we're sleep deprived.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.820]   And never when we're well-rested.
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.380]   - I would love to say that I never look at them
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.860]   except I look at maybe every one of them.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.260]   - Here I will editorialize
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.540]   because the notion of not looking at comments
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.040]   is unreasonable to ask of any academic.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.720]   Because academics, we are all trained
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.000]   to look at our teaching evaluations.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.760]   And just like with online comments,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.640]   to ignore 20% of them.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.600]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.200]   We look at them all in any event.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.480]   So in terms of translating this to behavior,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.600]   I don't particularly enjoy alcohol.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.680]   I guess I might be fortunate in that sense,
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   but I also have never really experienced
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.160]   the pleasure of drinking alcohol.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   I sometimes like the taste of a drink,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.680]   but I never liked the sensation.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.600]   So that's, I don't have a lot of familiarity with this,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.640]   but many people do.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.840]   And I understand that.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   So let's say somebody enjoys a glass of wine or two
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.520]   with dinner and they eat dinner at 7 p.m.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.040]   Is that likely to disrupt their sleep at all?
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.880]   Let's just sort of,
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.360]   let's make this a series of gradations.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.880]   - And the answer is yes.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.560]   I think once they just looked at a single glass of wine
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.160]   in the evening with dinner,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.880]   and I would be untruthful if I didn't just simply say
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.600]   it has an effect and we can measure that
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.000]   in terms of the actual- - Less REM sleep.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.200]   - Less REM sleep.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.920]   And one of the fascinating studies,
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.280]   I can't remember what dose,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.600]   I think they got them close
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.840]   to a standard illegal blood alcohol level.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.280]   So maybe they were a little bit tipsy.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.320]   And yes, you see all of the changes that we just described.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.440]   They sort of lose consciousness more quickly.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.800]   They have fragmented sleep
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.240]   and they have a significant reduction in REM sleep.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.400]   But what was also interesting
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   because REM sleep, as we spoke about before,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.520]   is a time when some hormonal systems
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.000]   are essentially recharged and refreshed,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.840]   growth hormone being one of them.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.800]   There was well over a 50%, five zero drop
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.840]   in their growth hormone release
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.960]   during alcohol-laced sleep at night.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
