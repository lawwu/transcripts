[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.400]   Why did the transgender movement catch us by surprise, and how should we respond now?
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.880]   That's the theme this week on the podcast, and with that goal in mind, we welcome Rob
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.480]   Smith to the podcast.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.160]   Rob is a theologian who lectures in systematic theology and ethics at Sydney Missionary and
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220]   Bible College in Australia.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.080]   He also serves as an honorary assistant minister at St. Andrew's Anglican Cathedral in Sydney.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.920]   Rob approaches the topic of the transgender revolution as a biblical theologian, as a
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.000]   historian of the movement as well, and as a pastor whose own family has been touched
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.240]   by gender dysphoria.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.080]   It hits rather close to home for him.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.520]   And we are all being hit by what he has called a "transgender tsunami" of gender fluidity
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.960]   in Western culture.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.400]   Rob has completed extensive research of the history of how we got to now.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.560]   The transgender movement, as you will hear, did not appear out of nowhere.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.120]   There is a backstory.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.920]   And to tell it, here's Rob Smith.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.440]   Yes, well, thank you, Tony.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.560]   That's a marvelous question.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.880]   It certainly didn't come out of nowhere.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.840]   You can trace the roots right back, really, I think.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.720]   Well, you can go back to Genesis 3 if you want to, but certainly in the modern period,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.240]   you can go back to the Enlightenment and then various developments subsequent to that.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.120]   But you're right to focus on the 1960s.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.600]   That's certainly where a number of revolutions came together.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   And I guess we're familiar with the label of the sexual revolution, which is, of course,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.120]   this sort of broad umbrella.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.120]   But there are a number of things going on there, I think, that really set the stage,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.200]   as you say, for the transgender revolution.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.520]   Let me just run through a number of aspects, I think, that are relevant.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.480]   You've got the advent of the contraceptive pill in 1961, which has the effect of severing
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.680]   sex from procreation.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.040]   And that itself then changed people's view of sex.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.680]   It became a leisure activity and something for pleasure rather than having a procreative
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.600]   purpose embedded in it.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.880]   And that, of course, then, I guess, opened the door to increased sexual freedom in a
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.640]   very new and pronounced way.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.960]   So that's one factor.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.480]   Also on the medical front, you've got the development of antibiotics.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.680]   I mean, they've been around for some decades before the '60s.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.480]   But I guess the more effective treatment of various sexually transmitted diseases and
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.600]   a perception that therefore developed that really people didn't need to worry about the
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.000]   danger of STDs.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.200]   And that, again, increased sexual experimentation.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.280]   So those things are going on in the broader society, and I guess you could say sort of
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.960]   pushed on by medical development.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.200]   Alongside of that, you've got various social revolutions, the feminist revolution, perhaps
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.080]   is the most obvious thing to pinpoint here.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.080]   And again, at the heart of that, you've got a, well, I guess the deconstructing of the
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.000]   way that people tended to think about sexuality and gender.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.840]   You've got Simone de Beauvoir's very famous statement that one is not born a woman, but
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.160]   one becomes a woman.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.600]   That becomes very, very important for later queer theory and transgender ideology.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.080]   You've of course got the problem that feminists are grappling with, that biology equals destiny,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.280]   although they're trying to work out how to stop biology equaling destiny.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.680]   And one of the solutions, of course, advocated by various feminist writers at the time was
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.640]   to eliminate sex distinctions.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:56.120]   So that's, again, a big part of the background to the transgender phenomenon.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.000]   And then, of course, you've got the homosexual revolution, which is happening again in the
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.200]   late '50s, '60s, and '70s.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.640]   I guess there's a broader acceptance of sexual nonconformity.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.520]   You've got the idea that biological sex perhaps does not determine a person's sexual orientation,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.920]   and therefore begs the question, well, does it then in fact determine a person's gender?
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.600]   Does there really have to be this necessary connection between biological sex and gender
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.000]   identity?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.280]   So all of those things, I think, are bubbling out of the sexual revolution of the '60s and
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.520]   paving the way for the transgender revolution.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.800]   You asked the question, why didn't we see it coming?
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   It was there to be seen, interestingly.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.040]   One of the things I've done is sort of trace back some of the history over the last 100
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.880]   years or so of the development of the transgender movement.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.520]   I mean, back in 1964, you've got the creation of the Erickson Educational Foundation, which
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.360]   was designed to promote both gay equality and transgender equality.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.160]   And that was set up by a trans man named Reed Erickson.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.880]   In '66, you've got a significant publication of a book called The Transsexual Phenomenon,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.840]   as well as the famous Compton Cafeteria Riots in San Francisco.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.480]   So there are things happening there in the '60s.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.640]   Even '68, you've got the International Olympic Committee wrestling with, well, what do we
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.720]   do with transsexuals who want to compete in the Olympics?
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.240]   And they had to make a determination about that.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.440]   And then perhaps the little known fact is that in the Stonewall Riots in '69, there
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.400]   were transgender patrons involved in that whole episode.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   And so the transgender revolution, same-sex revolution, they've really been tied together
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.100]   in a variety of ways from the start.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.120]   But I think it's just a prominence of the homosexual revolution that perhaps has obscured
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.840]   the transgender revolution that was, as it were, just tucked in behind.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.920]   And now that same-sex marriage has been realized in many parts of the Western world, it's in
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:22.160]   some ways moved to one side so that the transgender movement is now, as it were, stepped forward
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.680]   to be the sort of major point of social and legislative and other kinds of engagement.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.680]   So there you go.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.280]   It's just an attempt to try and make sense of how we've got here, how this has sort of
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.040]   come upon us seemingly out of nowhere, but in reality, not out of nowhere.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.440]   No, that's a great summary of the backstory.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.240]   I wish we had time for more of the history, but I want to stay focused on the here and
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.040]   now from here on.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.840]   As you can imagine, we get a lot of questions on transgenderism in the inbox of this podcast.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.960]   And one of the most common questions, it seems, is that many Christians who are so far removed
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.880]   from transgender impulses themselves ask whether gender dysphoria is itself a phantom impulse,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.160]   something that's merely culturally engendered, or is it real?
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   Is it tangible?
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   And if so, how real is it?
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.920]   You're not far removed from this question.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.960]   I mean, in your own pastoral care and your personal experience, is gender dysphoria a
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   real condition?
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.760]   Yeah, well, thank you for that.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.080]   Let's perhaps just be clear for the listeners about what we're talking about here.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:40.280]   Gender dysphoria, that expression is really, I guess, it's the latest medical diagnostic
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:47.320]   term for the experience of distress, which some people have when their psychological
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:54.640]   or emotional gender identity or sense of gender doesn't match up with their biological or
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.640]   birth sex.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.840]   Previously, and certainly in earlier versions of what's called the Diagnostic and Statistical
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:07.720]   Manual of Mental Disorders, that phenomenon was referred to as gender identity disorder.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.920]   But I guess there was a move, again, amongst the American Psychiatric Association to try
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.840]   and destigmatize that disorder.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.280]   And now it's, I guess, being normalized in society.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.840]   And so what's happened is that it's simply now the distress that the person feels it's
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   being focused on.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:35.520]   If a person has a mismatch between their sense of gender and their biology, and they're not
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.520]   distressed by it, then they don't have any condition according to the APA.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.360]   They don't have gender dysphoria.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:49.040]   Gender dysphoria focuses in on the distress that a person may feel, and of course, most
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.040]   do feel if they have this mismatch.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.400]   So I hope that wasn't too convoluted, but it's just important to understand what exactly
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   we're talking about.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.600]   Now, is it a real condition?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.280]   Well, certainly it's a real experience condition for those who have this sense of mismatch.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:18.040]   For many, if not most, it's profoundly distressing and anxiety producing and shame producing
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.040]   and depressive.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:26.120]   It's an awful condition or affliction to bear.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.000]   But I guess the key question lurking in there is what kind of condition is it?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.360]   This again, I think, is where our culture is easily confused.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.800]   And one of the perhaps confusing factors is that there is a number of conditions that
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.080]   fall under the umbrella of intersex, where a person is born with some kind of genital
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:54.040]   or biological ambiguity, and that certainly can give rise to gender dysphoria.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:00.240]   Or you've had some tragic stories, for example, of a circumcision gone wrong and then doctors
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.280]   making a decision to turn a boy into a girl, as it were, trying to deal with their mistake.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   And then this boy later on, of course, he's going to have profound gender dysphoria.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:21.720]   So there are those kinds of, I guess, biologically created instances of gender dysphoria.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:29.480]   But for those for whom there is no biological ambiguity or any kind of intersex ambiguity
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.600]   or anything of that kind, then we need to ask, well, what is gender dysphoria for them?
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:41.520]   Well, I think the answer is quite clearly it's a psychological condition, not a biological
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.920]   or you might even say ontological condition.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.120]   The problem is in the psychology, they feel like they're in the wrong body.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.360]   They're not actually in the wrong body.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.480]   It's not that you've actually got a man inside a woman's body or a woman inside a man's body.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:04.640]   But clearly the person feels as if they've been perhaps given the wrong body or they
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.440]   feel that mismatch.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.120]   And as I said, a very distressed by it.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.000]   So if we understand that and understand that people really do suffer from this, it ought
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.520]   to evoke our compassion because it's a horrific affliction to bear.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.840]   That's one of the reasons why the suicide or attempted suicide rate for those with gender
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.120]   dysphoria is as high as it is.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.920]   So I hope that sort of helps perhaps.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.320]   I know it's not a simple answer, but I hope it perhaps clarifies issues.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.640]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   It does, yes.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   So is it safe to assume the biological ambiguity is the minority condition with the psychological
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.080]   condition being in the majority of cases?
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   - Yes, I think that that's certainly true.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:53.240]   I mean, it's enormously difficult to get accurate figures, but I think that is certainly the
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.240]   case.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240]   - Interesting.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   Thank you, Rob.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.040]   We have only begun the week.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.320]   Rob will be with us all week answering a number of questions, and there are many.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.040]   So what causes gender dysphoria?
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.520]   That's the next question I have for him tomorrow.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.760]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with guest Rob Smith from Sydney,
