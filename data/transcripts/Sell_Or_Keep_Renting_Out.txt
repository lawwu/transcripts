[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about whether
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.160]   we should rent out or sell an investment property when inflation is high. So we all know inflation
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.680]   is high right now, 8.5% was the latest print, maybe it'll go up but hopefully it's going to
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.800]   start fading into the second half of 2022 and 2023. However, whenever there's turnover with a
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.480]   rental property, you're always going to be faced with this dilemma of whether to sell
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.640]   or just keep on renting it out. And the older and wealthier I've gotten, the more I prefer to sell
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.280]   rather than rent out. Being a landlord can sometimes create some very unpleasant experiences.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.400]   Whether it's getting paid late, experiencing damage, having to fix something, or resolving
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   some type of misunderstanding, being a landlord is not for everyone. As you get older, it's definitely
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.120]   not something you want to do. It takes discipline and you need a lot of good patience and people
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.240]   skills frankly. After I reached my limit of managing three rental properties, I stopped
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.280]   buying. I just couldn't take the amount of turnover and management and maintenance issues
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.240]   any longer. So instead I started investing my cash flow in private real estate funds that
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.000]   invested across the sunbelt. This way I could diversify my real estate holdings and more
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.120]   importantly earn more 100% passive income. I'm really thankful that I've been able to invest
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.400]   in private real estate because it just helps me diversify. I just don't want all of my real estate
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.800]   assets to be in San Francisco. It's expensive, cap rates are low, what if there's a natural
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.280]   disaster. So I want to diversify and I want to earn more passive income. And I'm assuming that
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600]   it's the same with you. So right now I'm faced with the dilemma of whether to rent out my
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.520]   investment property or sell it. But this time we are in an unusually high inflationary environment.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.800]   I'm hopeful inflation will start fading in the second half of 2022 and in 2023, but you just
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.400]   never really know. So in this episode I'm going to walk through the pros and cons like I do with
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.080]   other dilemmas in my upcoming book, Buy This, Not That, How to Spend Your Way to Wealth and Freedom.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.920]   Every dilemma I face is viewed with a 70/30 decision making framework. After analyzing the
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.960]   situation, my goal is to make the right decision at least 70% of the time with 70% confidence or
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.400]   greater. And at the same time, I recognize that about 30% of the time I will make a suboptimal
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.160]   choice and need to learn from it. This is something I hope all of you guys do. Start
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.760]   thinking in probabilities, not absolutes. Don't wait for 100% certainty to make that choice.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.560]   I think 70% or greater is when you can start making that move. And how do you get to the
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.680]   confidence of 70% plus? Well, it takes practice. It takes constantly predicting outcomes and
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.800]   analyzing your predictions with the outcome and analyzing where you went wrong or where you went
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.440]   right. You can make predictions from NBA championships to whether your friend's new
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.640]   relationship love interest will last. The idea is to narrow that confidence percentage to as close
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.960]   to 70% as possible. Because a lot of times people are like, well, I have no idea. I have a 40 to 80%
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.240]   confidence. The idea is to narrow it down to 70 to 75%. And you'll get better with practice over
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   time. So in this dilemma, rent out a home or sell in a high inflationary environment. I think the
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.000]   70% move is to rent out your rental property in a high inflationary environment to capture higher
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.840]   rents. Real estate is not only a great hedge against inflation, it is a great beneficiary
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.120]   of inflation. The best thing we can do in a high inflation environment is to own important real
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.360]   assets that inflate with inflation. So real estate, our housing living situation is the most
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.880]   important asset because if you can get your living situation under control in an affordable manner,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.480]   you can do many, many other things, right? Food is not that expensive. You don't have to buy all
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.000]   these clothes, transportation. Hopefully you have public transportation, but if not, then a car,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.840]   unfortunately, would be a necessity and you're going to be faced with rising car prices and
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.120]   rising gas prices. So let's go into detail on why renting out and investing property in a high
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.680]   inflation environment is the right move. So first, you want to ride the inflation wave as long as
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.400]   possible. If you are faced with the dilemma to rent or sell, you should rent out when inflation
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   is high. Take full advantage by capturing market rents. This is especially true if high inflation
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.720]   is transitory. Since the mid 1990s, the average US inflation rate has hovered between two to two
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.560]   and a half percent. And 2% is the official Fed funds or the Federal Reserve inflation rate target.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.040]   US inflation is now at eight and a half percent, right? However, it's unlikely an inflation rate
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.640]   that's four times the 30 year average will remain for longer than a couple of years. I would bet
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.120]   heavily that inflation is going to fade by 2023. Now, two, you want to buffer against downturns.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.880]   Given the economy is cyclical, landlords may one day face tough times when they must cut rents to
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.440]   attract tenants. Landlords may also face times when they will have higher vacancies than normal.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.680]   And vacancy is what tends to kill profitability the fastest. Therefore, the savvy landlord will
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.800]   take advantage of high rents when times are good and save the extra profits to cover for when times
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.880]   are bad. It's the same situation similar to tax cuts. You know, you might feel good about having
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.800]   a tax cut and having more disposable income. However, if you're savvy and you realize the
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.600]   tax cuts aren't going to last because the next administration is going to raise taxes, then
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.400]   you're going to save when times are good. Three, to cover higher costs, right? Good times create
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.680]   high inflation. People feel richer, they spend more. And unfortunately, that means your costs
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.360]   may inflate as well. Let's say your gardener cost or the plumbing cost or electric nutrition cost,
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.120]   whatever it is. So when you're taking advantage of high inflation by charging higher rents,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.520]   hopefully, those rents will more than offset the rise in costs. Four, to generate more valuable
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.960]   passive income. We're still in a very interesting scenario right now. Inflation is high. However,
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.240]   mortgage rates, you know, are higher than they were in 2020 and 2021. But they're still negative,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.760]   negative real mortgage rates, meaning that your debt is getting inflated away. So when rates are
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.200]   low, or relatively low, they're still relatively low right now, folks, don't don't think 5% on the
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.920]   average 30 year fixed mortgage is high. It's not it's low, you can still get lower arm rates as
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:55.760]   well. So when rates are low, the value of passive income goes up because it requires more capital
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.400]   to generate that same amount of passive income. So overall, your passive income is still quite
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.920]   valuable, because rates are still historically low. Now five, I talked about this already
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.360]   negative real mortgage interest rate, you want to hold on to your low interest rate debt for as long
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.400]   as possible in a high inflationary environment. Because inflation is basically inflating away
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.600]   the true cost of that debt. More than 90% of mortgage debt out there is trading at under a 5%
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:33.360]   interest rate. My seven one arm that I got in 2020 is that a 2.125% interest rate, I'd be foolish to
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.920]   start paying that off. When inflation is at 8.5%. I have a negative six plus percent interest rate.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.560]   That's crazy. And I'm going to hold on to that for as long as possible. And the other thing is,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.440]   I know some people are like, Oh, well, you got an arm and inflation went up. Well, I still believe
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.880]   that the long term trend for inflation and interest rates is down. So yeah, rates are up right now,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.200]   folks. And you know, I might be looking foolish. However, I think rates are going to go back down
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:09.760]   in 2023 and 2024. And my arm doesn't reset until 2027. And so we can revisit where interest rates
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.240]   and inflation will be in 2027. I'm pretty sure certain it's going to be lower than where it is
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.680]   right now. Okay, six, six reason why you should continue to rent out your rental property,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.240]   you want to minimize tax liability. If you sell your rental property, you may have to pay capital
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.920]   gains tax due to depreciation recapture and price appreciation. You know, property prices have done
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:37.200]   very well since 2020. And very well since 20 2011 and 2020 12. So in general, the best holding period
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.560]   for real estate is forever, you want to be like the billionaires out there that own a lot of assets,
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.120]   they never sell and they just borrow from their assets. So you can tap your equity,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.200]   and then reinvest in somewhere else. But in general, I don't think it's great to tap equity
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.840]   to leverage up to buy more real estate. But that's something you've got to decide based
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.320]   on your risk parameters. Seven, minimize reinvestment headaches. I tell you, if you
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.160]   sell something and you have this huge windfall, it might feel good, but chances are high that
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.840]   you're going to be at a loss for what to do with your money. When I sold my rental property in 2017,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:21.600]   I had $1.8 million in windfall after commissions after taxes. And basically, that was way more
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.680]   than I've ever had, you know, to invest at one time, usually I'm investing like 10,000 20,000
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.200]   50,000, you know, at the most at one time. So it took me about six months to try to redeploy that
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.080]   capital in a positive way in a safe way. Because, you know, for 13 years, the rental property was
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.560]   just chugging along just appreciating I never really thought about it. But as soon as you
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:51.040]   realize those gains, you will see its real time performance. So six months, it took me to re
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:10:01.280]   invest that money. And I did 33% in the S&P 500 and some stocks, about 30% in municipal bonds,
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.200]   and then the remainder in real estate crowdfunding and private real estate to diversify.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:12.080]   It's not easy to reinvest a big windfall. Alright, so I've given you seven reasons why you should
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.440]   hold on to your rental property and keep renting it out to capture higher market rents in a high
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.720]   inflationary environment. Now let's go through some of the reasons why you should sell. Inflation
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.160]   might only be temporary. Right? Like if you look at the history, we're, we're inflation is at two
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.520]   to two and a half percent, we're at eight and a half percent, the chances are high, it's going to
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.200]   be temporary, and inflation starts coming down, perhaps rental start coming down, and then you
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.920]   won't be able to get that high price that you want. So you've kind of got to figure out where
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.400]   we are in the real estate cycle. To me, it feels like we're in phase three, not two and a half
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   to three. So phase two is expansion, phase three is hyper supply phase four is recession,
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.680]   right? Some cities, you know, in the heartland, where you can just build an endless amount,
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.120]   because land is infinite supply, it seems, I would be a little bit skeptical about buying
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.920]   property there. And you know, if you had a good run owning Austin, Texas real estate,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.200]   over the past two, three years, maybe you want to offload some because supply is coming. Another
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.280]   reason why you might want to sell is when your depreciation benefit runs out. So depreciation
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.600]   is a non cash expense, it's just the IRS decided you can depreciate straight line depreciation of
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.760]   your buildings value over a 27.5 year period. And that helps lower your rental income. So which
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.920]   means it lowers your taxable rental income. So when that expense is gone, you know, maybe it
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.400]   depends on how your income is structured, you might want to sell the rental property because
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.480]   you might have to be paying more ongoing taxes. Our next reason, when there's an easier way to
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.160]   own rental property, the older and wealthier you get, I highly doubt you'll want to spend more time
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.720]   managing rental properties. Yeah, you can hire a property manager, but then you have to manage
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.880]   the property manager while paying, you know, one or two months worth of rent as a fee. Now,
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:13.840]   there are many ways to reinvest in real estate, right? You can buy public REITs private funds.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.560]   I like fundraisers because they buy single family homes, rental properties and the Sunbelt.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.680]   To me, that is a demographic that I think is going to do well long term. And it helps me diversify my
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:29.280]   expensive coastal city real estate for when cap rates are no longer attractive. Think about cap
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:36.960]   rate as a net rental yield. So compare the cap rate to the risk free rate of return. So 10 year
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.640]   bond yield, let's say it's at 3% and your cap rate is at 3.1%. So you have a point 1% premium,
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.440]   is that really worth it to have to manage property and you know, fix things and stuff?
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.040]   Some would say no, I think many would say no, if you could earn a risk free 3% rate of return.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.160]   However, you would only hold on if you think the property is going to continue to appreciate
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:05.440]   or you can raise rents, right? Fifth reason to sell major life event. Now, there are some key
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.160]   life events that warrant the re-evaluation of owning investment properties. Maybe it's a birth
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.960]   of your son or daughter, a death in the family, a terrible accident that requires extra care,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.960]   an unwanted layoff, or a job relocation to name a few events. Managing rental properties takes time,
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:29.040]   even if you hire a manager. When my son was born, I was just a first time father who had read like
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.720]   five books and I wanted to be hands on and I just didn't have any bandwidth to deal with this
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.080]   particular rental property with four or five guys as tenants always throwing parties and all that
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:46.400]   stuff. Another great time to sell is if you expect a huge recession, a really bad recession,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.560]   not, you know, not the March, April recession of 2020, you know, the lasted relatively short
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.160]   period of time as a quick rebound, but something that drags on for years, you know, one, two,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:06.560]   three years, like the global financial crisis, right? It was bad from 2007 to 2010. That's three
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.000]   years of kind of misery. And then only in 2011 and 2012, did people start feeling better about
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.640]   themselves. The problem with this is you just never know how bad the recession will be, how long it'll
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.320]   be, and when it'll come. Just think about all the people who sold real estate in February, 2020,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.160]   right before the lockdowns began. Some probably most felt good, like, ah, I sold out. Great,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.320]   awesome. But of course, real estate prices went up 20 to 50% over the next two years. And if you
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.520]   didn't get back in, well, then you missed out. All right, seven, when real estate commands greater
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:48.400]   than 70% of your net worth. I would say really more than 50%. But I said 70% because some of you,
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.880]   you know, might be younger, you just bought real estate, and it's just accounts for a big portion
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.600]   of your net worth. But my recommendation is to try to get your primary residence equal to 30%
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.880]   of your net worth or less the value, the total value. And for real estate to be no more than
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.640]   about 50% of your net worth, because you want to have diversified assets that zig when others zag.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:18.800]   Eight, you want to sell because you way exceed the 250 to 500,000 tax free profit. It's actually
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.000]   not way exceed. When you're right at that limit, and you can sell tax free, that might be an
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.080]   optimal time depending on your current income and marginal tax rate. Obviously, the higher
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:37.360]   the marginal tax rate you face, maybe the better actually it is to sell before you surpass that
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:45.040]   limit by too far. Nine, when commission rates decline here in 2022, it's pretty amazing that
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.480]   it still costs 5% commission to sell your home, two and a half percent to each, you know, the
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.560]   buying agent and the selling agent. And then you've got like, one to 2%, based on the taxes you pay,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.600]   and so forth. So when commission rates come down, you know, it creates a more liquid market. And
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.520]   that's the irony of having high, stubbornly high commission rates is, you know, people just don't
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.920]   want to bother why bother paying that commission, paying a higher home price, or, you know, paying
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.040]   a higher rent to find a new home, just stay where you are. It's just much easier, because commissions
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:25.600]   and taxes creates economic waste. All right, finally, when there are major upcoming repairs,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   you might want to just sell because you just don't want to deal with installing a new water heater,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.440]   replacing the windows, replacing the roof, painting the house, and so forth. Right? Just sell it as
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.480]   is, make the disclosures and just let the new buyer spend their time and money to fix those
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.400]   things. Now, if you just painted the house, well, it's actually could be a good time to sell too,
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.320]   because it's as good as it's gonna look. And then it just fades over time. At the same time,
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.120]   you might want to enjoy the fixing for a while because it hopefully won't give you problems for
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.160]   many, many years. All right, now that we've gone through the pros and cons, I think the bottom line
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.080]   is it is better to keep holding on to your rental property in a high inflationary environment,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:17.360]   and capture market rents. That is the 70% plus move. When it comes to owning investment property,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.520]   real estate in general, the ideal holding period is forever. It's almost like a war of attrition.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.960]   Whoever can hold on to their real estate, the longest generally becomes the wealthiest. All
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.480]   right, I hope you enjoyed this episode. This is the exact type of analysis I do for some of life's
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.360]   biggest dilemmas in my book, Buy This, Not That, how to spend your way to wealth and freedom.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.800]   I appreciate all your support, pre-ordering hard copies. They really mean a lot to me. And the
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:51.120]   book is out July 19, 2022. Because of supply chain issues, it's been delayed by three weeks, but it's
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.720]   It's still coming and it's going to be better than ever.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.920]   Thanks so much, everyone.
