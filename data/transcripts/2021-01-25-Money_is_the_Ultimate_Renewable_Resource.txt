[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.160]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.080]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.080]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.160]   Today we're going to talk about philosophy, philosophy of time and money.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.120]   Because I believe that if you have your philosophy right, and what I mean by right is right for
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.280]   you, then you'll be more empowered to make appropriate decisions with how you use your
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.960]   time and your money.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.040]   So in today's show I'm going to give you a menu of ideas that will lodge themselves in
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.900]   your brain and you can use to analyze your actions and think about whether your actions
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.080]   align with your values and with your personal philosophy.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:01:01.400]   I have found myself amplifying this topic more than almost any other topic in my private
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.800]   consulting work.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.200]   I find myself talking about time and money.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.400]   I've mentioned the statement I'm about to make publicly at various times, but I haven't
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.480]   really amplified it in the same way that I'm going to do now.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.720]   But I believe it's important and will help you to think about things properly.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.840]   Goes like this.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.620]   Money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.120]   Money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.320]   There is no limit to the amount of money that is available.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.500]   There's no limit to the amount of money that is available in the world at large.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.520]   There are hundreds and hundreds of different currencies that have been developed throughout
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   human history.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.480]   Oh, thousands, I mean more than hundreds if we don't hit through all of history.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.160]   But there are hundreds of currencies actively in use around the world today.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.640]   There are many competing hundreds of new currencies being developed and lobbied for and participated
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.560]   in today.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.160]   And most of these currencies have no literal end as to how much there can be.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.200]   Anytime we need more money, we just make more of it, right?
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.240]   We just print more of it.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.080]   We just lend some more money out and manufacture some more digits on a computer screen and
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.720]   we've got more money.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.160]   There's no limit to the amount of money that is available in the world.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.800]   And even if you want to talk about money not in terms of the number of digits, but simply
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.480]   in terms of a representation of value, there's no limit to the amount of value that can be
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.160]   created in the world.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.880]   There's no objective limit to the size of an economy.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.460]   You could have a country that has a $100 trillion economy and there's no reason in the world
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.000]   why a decade later that country can't have a $200 trillion economy.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.760]   Money is unlimited.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.240]   And even if we bring things down to a more personal level, the amount of money that is
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.480]   available to you is unlimited.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.740]   You can always earn more money.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.680]   You can always make more money.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.000]   You can always gain more money.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.680]   You bring more value to the marketplace and you can gain more money.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.160]   And you can do this at any time in your life.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   The Motivational Speakers folders are full of stories about Colonel Sanders and Grandma
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.440]   Moses and many aged people who hit upon that idea, that thing that they all of a sudden
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.960]   developed to make them exceedingly wealthy.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.320]   And they're all true.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.200]   And I would argue that your own personal experience mirrors this.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.600]   Throughout your lifetime, there have been many times where you haven't had enough money.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.040]   And at every single one of those times, you've just gone out and figured out how to get more.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.440]   That's what people do.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.140]   When they don't have enough money, they go out and they figure out how to get more money.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:20.080]   And so I argue that money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.340]   Now let's contrast money with time.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.480]   My argument is that time is the ultimate non-renewable resource, both on a macro scale and on a personal
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.680]   micro scale.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   Why?
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.080]   Well, time has an absolutely fixed quantity.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:53.120]   There was a point in the history of this universe when history itself began because time began.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.480]   There was a point when time began and there will be a point in the future at which time
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.720]   ends.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.000]   That's on the broad scale.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.360]   Our entire life's existence is governed by time.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.640]   Everywhere in the world, we all have some system of a calendar through which we track
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.240]   the years, the months, the weeks, the days.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.800]   And every single one of us has exactly the same amount of time on a daily basis.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.040]   24 hours and it's gone.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.360]   And while there are different ways of marking the time, there are different calendars that
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:46.480]   we could look at to decide what year it is, the reality is that time is a fixed constant.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.560]   More importantly, once time is gone, it is gone.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.080]   You've now been listening to me for five minutes and 55 seconds.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.400]   And in the last five minutes and 55 seconds, you've experienced something that you will
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.620]   never ever experience again in your life.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:15.720]   You've experienced the passage of that specific set of five minutes and 55 seconds.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.240]   That's why the most valuable thing that you give to me on a regular basis is your time.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.440]   I don't worry much about money.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.760]   I do my best to be a good provider of things for good amounts of money because I recognize
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.520]   that money represents something important.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.900]   But I feel the pressure every single day to do a good job with your time, to give you
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.400]   something worth thinking about, because that's the most precious thing.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.320]   You've got 24 hours in a day.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.040]   And once these 24 hours are gone, they're never coming back.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.640]   It gets even worse.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:07:02.560]   That the number of years, months, weeks, days, hours, seconds of your life are absolutely
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.920]   limited.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.760]   There was a day on which you let out your first cry and you were born.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:20.680]   And that's the marker that we use to identify when time began for you.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.560]   And there will come a day at which your friends all gather to celebrate your life and they'll
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.800]   all acknowledge you're dead.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:37.400]   And that's the marker that we use to identify when time finished for you.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:48.640]   Now the things that happen between those two dates are exceedingly important.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:56.680]   And it's how you use the time between those dates that will govern the meaning of your
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.600]   life.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.080]   For me, these concepts have become deeply important.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:11.120]   Just to recognize that money is unlimited, time is limited.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.720]   Now generally the direct application of this, the reason I find myself repeating this little
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.520]   truth again and again, usually in a slightly more abbreviated format than I've just done,
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:33.240]   is that there are times in life at which time and money change in importance.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.480]   And this makes sense to me.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.760]   First of all, we don't experience all units of time the same and we don't experience all
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.120]   units of money the same.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.520]   Let me sketch that out for you with an example.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.120]   I have children and one of the things that's fascinating about having young children is
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.960]   watching how important the days of their lives are to them.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.880]   Most importantly, of course, their birthday.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:04.800]   And I was recently reminded my five-year-old has been asking again and again and again,
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.080]   "Daddy, how much longer till my birthday?
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.520]   How much longer till my birthday?"
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:16.240]   And it's funny because this didn't begin a month before the actual birthday.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.120]   Rather, it was more like a month after the previous birthday.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.080]   We make a modest celebration of birthdays in my family.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.960]   I like to acknowledge the day and fet the child on that day.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.600]   But I wouldn't call it anything over the top.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.080]   We don't do pony rides and clown shows.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.300]   We just celebrate the person on that day.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.100]   We have a modest party and we give a modest number of birthday presents.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.840]   As an adult, you look at it and you say, "It's a birthday, right?
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.920]   We're happy to celebrate the child."
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.240]   But it's nothing over the top.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.920]   It's nothing that is really worth looking forward to for an entire year.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.520]   But for my children, their birthdays are very, very important.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.640]   Those specific days are a big deal to them.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.560]   And as I've watched that, I've reflected on why I think that is.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.880]   And to me, it's simple.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   It's simply to acknowledge that for a child, the passage of one year, let's say you have
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.000]   a five-year-old child.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.920]   For your five-year-old child, the passage of one year, 365 days, represents one-fifth
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.680]   of their lived experience.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.760]   They don't have a lot of previous experience to compare it to.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.240]   And so that year is a very significant chunk of time because it represents a large percentage
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.600]   of their total lived experience.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.080]   Whereas perhaps you're 50 years old, that same year is now only one-fiftieth of your
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.080]   experience.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.800]   Instead of it being 20% of your life experience, it's 2% of your life experience.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:54.240]   So while that year is still important, it's a smaller percentage of your lived experience.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.000]   So to me, it makes sense why children have different perspectives of time.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.920]   But of course, it's also true that time, while fixed in objective reality, can change its
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.040]   nature dramatically depending on how we're experiencing it.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.480]   The minutes flow very slowly when you're dancing up and down outside of a bathroom,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.520]   desperately trying to make it in the door before everything lets loose.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.440]   On the other hand, there are times when you're having a peak experience and the hours just
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.840]   disappear.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.520]   So our experience of time is different.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.740]   Now these arguments, I think, also apply to the field of money.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:40.160]   For example, the experience of somebody going from totally broke, zero dollars of savings,
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.240]   to having a thousand dollars of savings, that's a very, very important event.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.480]   It can help somebody to gain a significant level of personal freedom.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.200]   Perhaps an adult-level version of that might be $10,000, right?
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.480]   To go from zero dollars of savings to $10,000 buys somebody a significant amount of freedom.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:06.860]   That $10,000 means a lot more than going from $100,000 of savings to $110,000 of savings.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:14.200]   The first million counts for a whole lot more than going from $30 million to $31 million
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   of savings.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.760]   And so our experience of money is different depending on where we are.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:27.540]   But because our experience, because of the way that we acquire money, generally speaking,
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.800]   we always have to take into account the interaction, the interplay of time and money.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.840]   This is most commonly understood just simply that when you're younger you have more time,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.480]   but when you're older you usually have more money.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.080]   And so when you're younger you might do certain things, do certain tasks that are very time
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.520]   intensive because you don't have money to solve them in some other way.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.480]   But when you're older, all of a sudden you realize the shortness of the days and you
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.960]   don't want to spend your time doing that, but you probably have more money.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.080]   And so you buy those tasks done for you by someone else.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.360]   We're accustomed to thinking about that.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.080]   We're also accustomed to thinking about money as a representation of time.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.680]   When I was younger, my father taught me that time, sorry, money is simply stored up time.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.380]   That when you take your time and you spend it to gain money, then you can save that money
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:21.480]   and now you have units of time saved that you can then use to pay other people to do
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.440]   other things for you, which saves you time.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:29.840]   I think there's some usefulness in thinking about money as stored up time, as something
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.380]   that you can do for yourself.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.320]   I think this is useful when you think about working and not working.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:40.440]   If you have somebody who works to earn their living and they earn $100 and they spend $100,
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.900]   they need to keep working to earn their living.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.160]   But if you think of somebody who works to earn $100 and saves $50 of that, they can
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.080]   now stop working for the same amount of time that it took them previously to earn the $100
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.160]   and spend the $50.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.760]   And so having time, having money buys you time.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.880]   It buys you freedom from work.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.920]   Sometimes I think we miss the elegant simplicity of this concept by simply acknowledging if
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   you'll save 50% of your money for every year that you work, you can afford to take a year
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   off.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.200]   That's a powerful concept, extremely powerful.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.800]   But I want to go a little deeper because there are times in your life in which money is more
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.360]   valuable and there are times in which it is less valuable.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.540]   And those times change, similar thing with time.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.160]   Time is more valuable, time is less valuable.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.640]   I don't have a perfect formula to teach you other than to simply point some of these things
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   out.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:46.160]   The first thing I would point out is a lot of times in the modern conception of financial
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.960]   planning, meaning the proper layout of a life, the proper ordering of a life, a life well
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:15:00.960]   lived involves going to school, going to college, getting a good job, building a good career,
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:07.040]   working at that good job, saving money, and then retiring when you're 65 in order for
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.520]   you to live out your golden years.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.600]   That concept ignores certain things that are time bound, most importantly the raising of
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   children.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.680]   I'm very conscious of this, of course, because I have four children.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:25.440]   And I think about this on a regular basis and I realize that just like I'll never get
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:32.320]   back the last five minutes in my life, I'll never get back the last year in my children's
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.200]   life.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:42.160]   Once my eldest goes from five years old to six years old, he or she's never going to
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.640]   repeat that particular year.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.800]   Once your first child graduates from high school, he or she is never going to graduate
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.920]   from high school again.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.160]   Once your first child catches that first touchdown, he's never going to catch that first touchdown
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   again.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.760]   These moments come and then they're gone.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.480]   And so one of the things I find myself reminding people is, "Listen, why are you saving money
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.840]   in the first place?
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.360]   Why are you actually stockpiling money?
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.320]   You're stockpiling money because you have these certain things in the future that you
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.320]   want to achieve.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.720]   But what you need to realize is the things that are the hardest for you to ever get back
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.480]   are usually sitting in front of you."
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:33.120]   So my little speech often to parents is, I just look down and I say, "Recognize that
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.080]   you've got X number of years left with your child."
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.240]   Even if you use the age of 18, I usually don't.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.040]   Because while certainly in the United States culture, the age of 18 is an age of legal
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   majority, children change earlier than that.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.880]   During adolescence, a child's attention tends to go from being focused on mom and dad and
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.280]   their personal family to focused on their own life, their friends, more outward focused.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.720]   And so your relationship with a 10-year-old daughter is going to be very different in
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.640]   nature than your relationship with a 15-year-old daughter.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.240]   Whereas your relationship with a 17-year-old daughter, I think, is in many ways going to
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.200]   be very similar to your relationship with your 19-year-old daughter.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.240]   The age of 18 is not the age in which the changes happen the fastest.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.000]   It's adolescence, it's puberty.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.880]   So you got to be aware of that.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:31.680]   In thinking about your family things, over the last weeks, I've been thinking a lot and
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.680]   talking with my wife.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.000]   I'm thinking, "Okay, what are we going to do in the coming years?"
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.600]   I'm intensely conscious of the ages of my children, recognizing that there are these
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.000]   things that are happening due to time that I don't get to change.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.880]   I don't get to change the passage of time.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.340]   And so I need to make the money fit the time, not the time fit the money.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:18:02.200]   In application, I think the time is often most valuable when you could be using that
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   time to make money.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.760]   I'll give you an example.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:15.680]   I have thought through whether I regret not working more when I was younger.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.760]   Sometimes I read accounts of very young people who come across the concepts of fire and extreme
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.400]   savings and such, and they're fabulously effective at it at a young age.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:36.000]   And I've often thought, "Man, if only I had known then, if only I had known then, if only
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.960]   I had known what I could accomplish if I were 15 years old."
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.200]   I've taught and consulted with people and they teach you how to be financially independent
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.400]   when you're 25 or when you're 30.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.320]   And I believe those things have value.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.440]   The problem is this.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:58.920]   How do you compare the value of being financially independent because you've worked a lot and
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:06.160]   saved a lot with other values?
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.280]   How do you compare those things?
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.560]   There's a man that I admire named Kevin Kelly.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.920]   He is the former editor of Wired Magazine.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:22.200]   And Kevin is just this eclectic person, really interesting guy, very eclectic, very well
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.320]   informed.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.080]   But he writes and tells stories sometimes of his travels when he was younger.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:35.360]   And he writes and talks about the years that he spent in Asia, back in the 1960s, I guess,
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   '70s, when it was difficult to be there.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.820]   And I always think about these stories when I hear people tell them of, "Oh, I spent three
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.320]   years in such and such a place, and I was totally broke the whole time, but the experiences
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.960]   that I had, the things that I learned from that."
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.200]   I personally never approached my life in that way.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.560]   I was always kind of a goal-focused person.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   The idea of just going somewhere and hanging out was incompatible with my orderly life,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.920]   with my structured life.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.720]   And so I think about that contrast.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:13.400]   And I think, "Well, do I regret not living more freeform like that person?"
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:18.680]   I remember one time I had a... when I was a financial advisor, I had a client, and he
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.120]   talked about... he was in his mid to late 50s, and we were talking about his finances.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.840]   He said, "I chose to spend all my money when I was younger.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:30.200]   And I realized that I was going to have more financial problems down the road if I didn't
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.620]   save money then, but I wanted to spend my money when I was younger.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.720]   And I wanted to have those experiences.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   And I'm glad I did.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.760]   And now I wonder if I did the right thing or not, because I don't have as much money
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.160]   saved as a lot of my peers do, but I'm glad I did."
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   You think about that.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.960]   You think, "Well, is one right or one wrong?"
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.720]   And of course the answer is, "Well, right or wrong for whom?
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.080]   For whom are we doing the analysis?"
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.080]   That's what you have to answer.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.440]   I don't regret the decisions that I made, but I also acknowledge the fact that I may
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:10.400]   have missed out on certain experiences because I didn't engage in that more just exploration,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.160]   as perhaps somebody might call it.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.880]   So there's time that's valuable.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.360]   Is it valuable to have a lot of money as a young person?
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:25.760]   Well, maybe, but then it's also valuable just to reflect on having time.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.960]   And if you use all that time and you gain a bunch of money, you can't necessarily go
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.240]   back and have those same experiences.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.120]   My experience now, even if I had all the money in the world, my experience now at a different
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.160]   phase of life of going to Asia and bumming around would be very different than if I had
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.640]   done it when I was 20.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:53.600]   The most important application for me though, and for many of my listeners, perhaps even
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   you, is how this stuff applies with our children.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:08.920]   See those most productive financial years are somewhat peskily in our modern economy.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:15.160]   They're somewhat peskily situated right in those most important years of parenting.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.160]   I've often thought, "Man, wouldn't it be great if when I was young, I could have just worked
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.180]   when I was single, then got married, maybe worked a little bit more and then stopped
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.400]   working for a job while taking care of children and then I'll go start working again."
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:35.040]   I genuinely frequently find myself speaking to empty nester couples and saying, "What
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.400]   do you have to do other than work?"
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.480]   Working 40 hours a week or 30 hours a week or 50 hours a week, these are not bad things.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:49.560]   An empty nester couple can move into a small apartment and love it.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.240]   Small apartment right in the middle of the city, all the nightlife all around, working
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.520]   a job.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:01.600]   It gives a structure to life, a sense of contribution, sense of enjoyment.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.880]   So I don't want to elaborate too much on this, but just the point is when you think about
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.520]   when the money is important, I often find myself saying to people, "Recognize that you
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.200]   can always get more money, but you can't always get more time.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.720]   You can always get more money, you can't always get more time."
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:27.820]   So don't trade those things you can't get more of unnecessarily or in an out of balanced
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:33.080]   way for those things you can always get more of.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   Why would you do that?
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.140]   It makes no sense.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.140]   And yet we do it frequently.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.880]   We trade time for more money.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:46.160]   Now I think there is an appropriate element of balance in all these things.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.640]   I'm sitting here at my desk working today.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:56.200]   I could go downstairs and be with my children, but is it just time that matters?
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.480]   No, I don't think so.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.200]   I don't think that my personal goals would be enhanced any more by saying, "I'm going
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.160]   to spend this particular hour with my children instead of working."
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.160]   Why?
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.160]   What am I going to do?
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   What's the activity?
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   What's the reason?
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   What's the purpose?
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.560]   I'm happy to take more time to be with my children when there's purpose in it, but I
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.520]   also believe that what I'm doing right now is important and there's purpose in it.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.600]   And there's purpose both in the simple practicalities of earning a living, but also in the grander
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.680]   scheme of things, the meaning of my life.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.040]   And so it's important to be balanced.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.520]   It's important to have an appropriate perspective.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:42.560]   But that perspective needs to change at times.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.940]   If you find yourself out of balance, out of whack in something, then that perspective
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.200]   needs to change.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:58.720]   For example, if you find yourself working nonstop, 100 hours a week, never seeing your
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:06.400]   eight and 10-year-old children, you need a slap in the face to say, "Extra money isn't
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.160]   going to help anything."
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.440]   You need to take care of your eight and 10, assuming that you have money already.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.940]   Now if you were totally broke, I would also, you're totally broke, you're sitting around
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.120]   living like a bum, but you're with your eight and your 10-year-old, I would want to also
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.700]   give you a slap in the face and say, "You need to go to work.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.040]   There's a balance here that you need to pay attention to."
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   But what about when it comes to living rich versus getting richer?
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:40.400]   Well, to apply this to some of the concepts I spoke about recently, where I talked about
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:46.560]   my ambition, which is to live less frugally and to live more richly, I think some of these
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.760]   things apply.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.200]   Where sometimes we've gotten so focused on the money that we've lost track of the value
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:02.400]   of the time and the value of enjoying the time, gaining meaning of the time.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.160]   I think we see this often tragically when we hear about somebody who dies right on the
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.160]   cusp of retirement.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.160]   It hits us hard.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.680]   I heard from a friend of mine, there was a guy who worked for the government, local government
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.800]   employee.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.840]   He was very much looking forward to retirement.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.780]   Of course, he'd worked for his 20 years to be enrolled in the government pension.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:27.840]   He had just bought his new RV to celebrate his retirement years, and he was looking forward
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   to it.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   And then he got sick.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:35.880]   This particular guy was coronavirus, got COVID-19, and he died.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.520]   And so now that pension goes back into the system to provide a bigger paycheck for somebody
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.320]   else and it goes back and his RV will go to someone else.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.520]   It feels tragic oftentimes.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:56.560]   But what feels to me tragic about that story, which again, I heard about a week ago, is
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.800]   a lot of times because of my perception of that kind of work.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.360]   I have several friends of mine who work for governments, and they're often not brimming
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.080]   with enthusiasm about the great meaning and the grand scope of the impact that they have
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.600]   on a daily basis at their work.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.120]   I don't believe that you always have to have some kind of sense of passion for, "Oh, I'm
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.280]   passionate about this work."
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.240]   I think that can be a false god.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.400]   I think that you can be passionate about how you do work, and I honor anybody who is productive.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.700]   I honor a man who goes to work at a job that he doesn't love on a daily basis and does
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.520]   it because that's how he gains his living.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.280]   That's an honorable thing, and it's worthy of admiration.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.600]   We shouldn't put someone down who engages in honest labor, even if it's working in a
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.560]   government job.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.240]   But we also acknowledge sometimes that there are some people who work in a job like that
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.880]   who aren't there because they chose to be there, but they're there because that's where
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   they ended up.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.560]   I have a number of friends like this, where they work in these jobs, and they just, "It's
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.560]   what I do.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   It's just a job.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   It gives me good health insurance.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   I got a pension."
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.360]   And you get this sense that they're just looking forward to the day when they can get out.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.080]   They're looking forward to the day when they can escape, when they can retire, when they
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.560]   can have the big retirement party.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.080]   And for that reason, it feels particularly tragic when somebody who's right on the cusp
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.000]   of escaping dies.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   I think, "Oh man, I don't want that to be me."
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.400]   You think, "Here's this person that saved for years, and they scoped out this really
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.920]   exciting time of their life, and now they're not going to get to it."
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.120]   It feels really tragic.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.680]   But it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:41.800]   First, you don't have to defer to the future a sense of enjoyment today.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.400]   I think this is where we often are, I'm too extreme in how I talk about it.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.920]   It's not that it's a bad thing.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.280]   You can enjoy your work, working for the local county government.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.760]   You can enjoy it.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.000]   You can enjoy the actual work.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.560]   You can enjoy the fact that your job has meaning.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.040]   You bring order and structure to your local community.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.320]   You serve your local community.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.960]   You can enjoy the daily nature of your work.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.720]   You can find a sense of satisfaction from doing a job well, even if it's something that
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.720]   is not particularly fun.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.840]   There's a sense of satisfaction of doing something well, of solving, of cleaning your little
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.240]   corner of the world, making something run smoothly, working hard, being effective in
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.280]   what you're doing.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.420]   You can find a tremendous amount of fun.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.840]   You go out on the boat with your family on Saturday.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.320]   You gather with your friends at church on Sunday.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.240]   It's a meaningful life.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.880]   I want to not be one of those who dismisses the great sense of meaning and satisfaction
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.940]   in an ordinary everyday life.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.000]   There is a lot of meaning in it.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.180]   But then of course, it's also possible that the job could be changed.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.240]   If somebody really didn't find a sense of meaning and satisfaction in the common ordinary
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.240]   things of life, then they can change those things of life and go in a different direction.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:01.040]   That's always been where my focus has been for me, because I always thought that can
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.820]   be solved quicker.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.240]   Why wait to retire to do that when you could do that at ... Why wait to retire to do that
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.080]   at 60 when you could do it at 40?
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:16.220]   When I see it, people who do things earlier are in a different order.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:21.400]   To me, it seems really powerful, much more engaging.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.120]   I'll use an example.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.780]   There's an RVing channel that I enjoy called Keep Your Daydream.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.260]   The hosts are Mark and Tricia Leach.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.340]   They have this channel called Keep Your Daydream on YouTube.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.360]   They started it something like three or four years ago.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.480]   They had at the time a 16-year-old, I think a 14-year-old and a 12-year-old, something
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.520]   like that, three children.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.160]   They didn't have a big RV.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.240]   They just had a half-ton truck and they bought a travel trailer, but they decided they were
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.480]   going to go and RV the country with their children.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   They sold their stuff.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.440]   They sold their house, put their stuff in storage, and they went out and started RVing
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.840]   the country with their children.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.000]   A number of years later, their oldest daughter went to college, then they continued with
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.800]   their other two sons.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.720]   Then their second son went to a boarding school to finish out his high school career, and
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:15.280]   so they're on the road still with their third child who's almost 16, who is probably going
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.960]   to transition out of that and do his own thing at some point here in the future.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:27.640]   Now, along the way, they've been able to build a business that made them money in doing it,
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.480]   but I've often wondered, what if they didn't?
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.640]   What if they just took the money from their 401(k) and they said, "We're going to go RVing
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:41.440]   with our children, and we're going to spend our retirement on this anyway."
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.240]   You ask a financial advisor that question, and what are we financial advisors going to
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   tell you?
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   "Don't do it.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.640]   That's just too risky.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.960]   Too risky to do it.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.720]   Too risky to take the money from your 401(k) and go and spend it on three years of RV travel
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   with your children.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   Too risky.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.680]   Don't do it.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.420]   After all, don't you know that your children don't want to support you when you're old?
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.120]   After all, you can't be dependent on other people."
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.840]   Now, is there an element of truth to that?
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.600]   I think so, absolutely, but life is risky.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.000]   The other guy that I just talked about, I don't know his name.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.320]   It was a friend of mine.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.900]   The friend was talking about his friend, but the other guy, we'll call him Tom, Tom died.
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.440]   He had all the money in his 401(k) and then he died.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:31.080]   How would his children feel showing up at his funeral if all they had to say was, "Dad
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.440]   just worked and worked and worked and saved and saved and saved, looking forward to his
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   retirement.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   Now he's dead."
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.920]   That's tragic.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.600]   And yet, think about how Mark and Tricia Leach, the Keep Your Daydream family, what if they
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.480]   did spend all their money on that trip with their children?
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.440]   What if they didn't wind up creating a new business and a new career?
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.920]   What if they did spend all their money and then the children went off to college and
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.480]   they started over?
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.560]   Imagine you're a 50 year old parent, you're a 55 year old parent.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:15.120]   Ask you a question, how quickly could you rebuild if you needed to or wanted to?
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.400]   If I were 55 years old and my children were all out of the house, I could probably do
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.280]   and I'm not there yet, but if I'm coaching a 55 year old, I bet I could coach a 55 year
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:32.960]   old to in 10 years replace what previously took them 30 years.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.080]   And I often felt that to myself when I walked away from my financial planning business.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.920]   I've thought, "Man, how long would it take me to rebuild?"
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.360]   Well, I did it for six years.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.080]   Today, I could probably rebuild in two years what I did in six years.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.520]   I could do it faster the second time around.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:54.200]   So what makes more sense?
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.760]   Spend the 401k RVing with the children, build memories that they're going to treasure, build
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.320]   an actual genuine close relationship with your children or ignore the children to fund
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.360]   the 401k?
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.000]   Clearly that's a false choice.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.960]   Doesn't have to be one or the other.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.600]   Clearly it's a false choice.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:28.400]   I simply want to show you and focus on the fact that when you prioritize, recognize what
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.080]   you're giving up and then plan appropriately.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.640]   It's perfectly fine for you to look at your children and say, "I'm happy with what I'm
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.040]   doing and I don't need to go spend the 401k on RVing for three years."
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.880]   Perfectly fine.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.800]   Not everyone should do those kinds of things.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.920]   I simply personally happen to enjoy those kinds of ideas and think about what happens
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.920]   if you do them.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.400]   And so those are the examples that I give, but it's perfectly fine not to do those things.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.600]   My dad never did that with me and I don't feel like I suffered.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.960]   So I don't wish that he did.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.960]   That's not the point.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.600]   The point is that in time between money, recognize that once your children are gone out of your
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.920]   house, they're gone out of your house.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.920]   You can still have a relationship with them, but that relationship is going to be very
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.200]   different.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.440]   So don't miss the things that cost money that are going to dramatically transform what
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:29.840]   you can do in favor of things that down the road will never be available to you again.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840]   That time will go.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.560]   I want to give a few other examples because I feel like this is very practical and if
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:41.040]   I give you some examples, you'll be able to assess your own life in an appropriate way
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:47.200]   and make sure that you're living congruently with it.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:54.240]   When I talked about extreme savings, I realized my epiphany that extreme savings is a very
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.600]   effective tool.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   Frugality, extreme frugality is a very effective tool of escape for people who don't like their
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.920]   job, but it's not necessary for those who do like their job.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.440]   There's an example that for me was important that I recently was touching into.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.320]   I've mentioned this particular individual before, not by name of course, but years ago
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:23.000]   when I was a financial advisor, there was a new young advisor who joined the firm that
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.720]   I was with.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.440]   I thought this guy was going to be a total loser.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.840]   I thought he was going to be a total loser.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.500]   I looked at him and I dismissed him quickly.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:41.240]   He was a kind of a preppy frat boy, not preppy, but like a frat boy kind of guy, big partier,
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:49.280]   very good looking, dressed sharp, the modern sharp dress, came from a wealthy family, had
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.040]   all his parents play things, had his dad's $1.5 million boat that he could take out on
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.540]   the weekend whenever.
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:59.000]   Parents were wealthy lawyers and didn't really have much to worry about.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.420]   Here he comes in after college into my office and he's going to start as a new financial
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.420]   advisor.
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.080]   Here's Joshua Sheets, the financial nerd.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.180]   I've nerded out about financial stuff for a long time.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.320]   I thought this guy's not going to last.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.160]   You ask him a question, here he is a financial advisor, you ask him a question about a Roth
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.760]   IRA, he can't explain a Roth IRA, has no clue how anything works.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.200]   I thought this guy's not going to last.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.880]   I pegged him as a total failure.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.080]   I was completely wrong about him.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.960]   I was completely wrong.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.040]   And I've often thought, why did I get it so wrong?
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.720]   Where was I wrong?
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.880]   Was I jealous of him?
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:48.220]   Was I wrong about what made a good, a successful financial advisor?
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:53.120]   Was I jealous of the fact that he'd had everything handed to him or I was, and I wanted to justify
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.520]   my own perspective of, you know, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and work your way through,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.520]   et cetera.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   I don't know.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520]   I don't know why I was wrong.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.200]   All I know is that I was wrong, totally wrong.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.320]   Fast forward today, this guy continues to be an extraordinarily successful and productive
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.080]   financial advisor.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.880]   And he's in his early 30s.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:17.040]   He makes a lot of money, drives a Bentley to work every day now, always drove fancy
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.040]   cars, right?
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.280]   Started in a BMW, but right now drives a Bentley to work every day, has been groomed to be
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.600]   one of the leaders in the financial advisory space.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.800]   Very, very, very, very successful, makes a lot of money.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.000]   And I've thought a lot about that over the years because it was just such a striking
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.800]   foil to me and to who I was.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.140]   I was the guy who, when I was a financial advisor, I was uncomfortable with the image
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.360]   of being a shark, right?
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.240]   So I intentionally downplayed my image.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.440]   I didn't dress like a shark.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.800]   I didn't dress sharp with all of the, a sharp suit I would dress in khakis and a blazer,
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   right?
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.440]   And kind of downplay the image.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   Right or wrong?
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.440]   I don't know, right?
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   I don't know.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.400]   I had reasons why that seemed to me to be the right thing at the time, but it was congruent
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.800]   with my personality.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.320]   But I've often thought, maybe I got it totally wrong.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.840]   Maybe I should have gone the other route.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.080]   I drove conservative cars.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   I didn't want to pull up in front of somebody's house and then say, "Oh, look, you try the
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.080]   fancy car."
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.800]   Well, you know, my friend drives a Bentley.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.520]   He can pull up anywhere and basically say, "I'm a financial advisor, man.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.080]   I'm supposed to know what we're talking about with money.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.440]   I'm not scared of you."
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440]   It worked for him.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   It worked for him.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.440]   There's no question about that.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.860]   But I thought, like, why was I trying so hard to save?
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.840]   Why was I trying so hard to live modestly?
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.240]   Why was I trying so hard to be frugal and save money?
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.720]   It was unnecessary.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.960]   Why not drive a Bentley when you're 30?
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:56.640]   Now the answer is that that particular job, at least the way I was doing it then, wasn't
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.640]   a good fit for me long-term.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.640]   It was boring.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.720]   I didn't like it.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.000]   And so I wanted out of it.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.880]   Once I got out of it, things could change.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.040]   Whereas, as I understand it from my friend, this guy, it's a good fit for him.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   He likes it.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.160]   It's a good lifestyle for him.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.840]   And that is one of the images that has really stuck with me.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.880]   If you're trying to get out of your life, if you're trying to get out of a job that
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.960]   you don't like or get out of a life that you don't like, then saving all the money in the
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.200]   world so you can change how you're using your time, it makes sense.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.480]   But if you like how you're using your time, then saving all the money in the world doesn't
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.200]   make sense anymore.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.240]   Why?
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:45.520]   Why go through years and years and years, scrimping and saving and scrimping and saving
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.080]   just so that you can leave a bigger estate when you die?
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.840]   What's the point?
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.720]   Again, let's be careful of our false dilemmas.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.080]   Doesn't mean you may not leave a big estate when you die.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.080]   That's fine.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.760]   There are lots of people who are totally content with what they're doing, very productive financially,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:12.040]   have no desire to spend more money, and yet are going to continue to accumulate money.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.200]   I don't think it's morally superior to spend all your money.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:21.240]   Just saying from a practical perspective, why the excess focus on getting rich if it
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:26.320]   costs you to be living today in a way that you don't like?
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.680]   Doesn't make sense.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:35.120]   So my basic argument that I desire to advance is this, saving money has to have a purpose.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.960]   There needs to be a purpose behind it.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:45.640]   You get to choose the purpose, but there needs to be a purpose.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:53.120]   When you're saving money and you're building up more and more money in the bank, get clear
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:42:01.000]   on what that purpose is and make sure that you've identified it and that it fits with
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.460]   what is important to you.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:09.520]   Without question, there are many people in the world whose lives would be dramatically
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:15.840]   improved if they saved more money.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:21.880]   In my listening audience, though, there aren't many of those people.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.120]   In my listening audience, there are a lot of people's lives who would be dramatically
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:30.720]   improved if they spent more money.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:41.760]   Don't let the blind collection and compounding of money keep you from doing something now
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:48.000]   that's important for you to do.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:56.840]   Don't let just a little bit more keep you from living well today, living richly today.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.640]   Up to you to decide what you want to buy with your money.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:05.460]   You can buy the satisfaction of paying off your neighbor's mortgage or your mom's mortgage
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.860]   or your daughter's mortgage or whomever.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:17.080]   You can also buy the satisfaction of a fancy new car or anything in between.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.960]   But don't just think, "Oh, I just have to have a little more money for down the road."
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:30.300]   Recognize that time is the thing that you never get back, whereas money itself is completely
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:39.680]   and totally renewable.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:48.480]   Don't let your personal habits of life be those that have been forced onto you by people
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.680]   who don't even know you.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.240]   This is kind of what I've realized has happened to me.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.360]   I've shared many times, and I'll share again, how shocking it was for me when I first started
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.960]   talking to people personally about their money.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.880]   The question I always used in an initial interview with somebody was, "Is there a point in time
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.480]   at which you'd like to not to have to work if you didn't want to?"
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.200]   I didn't like to say retirement, but I would say, "Is there a point in time at which you'd
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.880]   like to not to have to work if you didn't want to?"
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.320]   Everyone would, the common answer about 50% of the time, "Well, absolutely.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.320]   Sure.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   You're today, right?
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   Or tomorrow."
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   One of those two.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.320]   We'd give a polite laugh.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.320]   It's a polite laugh.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.320]   Then, of course, I would say, "Okay.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   No, tell me.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   Really.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   What age?"
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.120]   A shocking number, I would guess, 75%, 70%, something like that.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:43.560]   The majority of people would say 65 or 60, 60 or 65.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.360]   I would go farther and I'd say, "Well, why 65?"
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.880]   The vast majority of the time, it was like, "I don't know.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.360]   That's the Social Security retirement age, right?"
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.640]   I'd say, "No, it's 67.2 for you."
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.320]   I realized we're all kind of group creatures.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.860]   This whole concept of retirement didn't ever exist in the context of human history.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:09.040]   It didn't ever exist in the context of human history until the modern age.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.320]   It was invented as a political experiment in the modern age.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.400]   Then it has been successfully marketed, but now 75% of the people that I talk to say they
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.320]   want to retire at 65.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.240]   There's something magical about 65.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   I can talk about the fact that the majority of people at that time, according to life
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.200]   expectancies tables, were scheduled to be dead by 65.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.400]   That was where the age was invented.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.400]   Then you start playing with it.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   You can say, "Why 65?
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   Why not 55?"
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.880]   "Well, I guess so at 55."
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.440]   "Well, why not 45?"
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.560]   "Well, I guess so."
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:49.800]   You continue this forward and then you get the power of the modern fire movement.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.080]   "Well, when would you like to be retired?"
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.000]   "Well, as soon as possible.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.680]   Five years, 10 years, seven years, by age 30, free at 40."
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.360]   "Okay.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   That's awesome.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.400]   Then what?"
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.400]   Some people have a good answer.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.920]   I'm not here to dump on anybody.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:16.400]   I believe that we should live well-examined lives to the extent that we're capable of
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.960]   it.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.760]   There are some people for whom the plan of working hard for a number of years, engaging
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.660]   in extreme savings, and then living off of their investments, that seems to be a really
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.800]   good plan.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.000]   Had lunch with somebody yesterday who did that and enjoyed it.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.120]   I think that's great for those people.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:46.280]   But I think there's some of us, like me, who kind of fall into that way of thinking without
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.440]   actually examining it.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:56.840]   It's just as much a group herd impulse to say, "I want to be fi at 40," as it is to
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.600]   say, "I want to retire at 65."
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.440]   That's what I realized for me.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.600]   "Wait a second, Joshua.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   That's not you.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.280]   You're not going to stop working.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.280]   That's not you.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   You don't want to do that."
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:15.720]   A lot of the lives of some early retirees to me sound dreadfully boring.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   Some people like it.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.840]   Again, I'm not criticizing you if you like it.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:24.120]   If you want to sit and work in your garden, if you want to do involved in your local charity,
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.880]   if you want to spend your time slow traveling the world, do it.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.200]   Go for it.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.040]   But that's not for me.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.560]   Those things bore me.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:40.080]   So each of us should pick our own path, and to the extent possible, we should do it in
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.200]   an examined way.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:49.600]   Let's do our best to appreciate things from the examples of others, and then articulate
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:57.520]   our own personal philosophies of why we do what we do, why we're living the way that
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.240]   we're living.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:05.200]   Recognize in that money is not the thing that's in shortage.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200]   Usually time is.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.280]   If you don't have any money at all, money is probably the thing that's in shortage.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.920]   I've continually found myself, I have friends and family members who, for reasons I can't
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.640]   comprehend, don't go and get jobs.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.000]   They just, "Oh, I'm doing my thing, doing my business.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.280]   I like being free.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.440]   I don't want someone else to have control over my schedule."
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.560]   I look at them, I'm like, "Bro, you're broke."
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.920]   That sucks.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.680]   To be broke, but to have all your time, to me, that stinks.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.960]   That's just not fun.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.560]   So going from zero to, I don't know, $10,000 in the bank, that would be a high priority.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.040]   If I had zero dollars, I would go get a job.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:50.200]   But then things change quickly.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:55.080]   Going from $100,000 to a million dollars, is that the ticket?
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   When are you going to start living?
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.080]   When you have $10 million?
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.080]   When you have $10 million, when?
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.080]   When?
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   That's the question.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:09.280]   I don't know that there's a right answer, but there's probably a right answer for you.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.080]   Always begin with the end in mind.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:17.120]   Recognize that at the end, your time is limited.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.200]   Your feet will be in the casket just like mine.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:26.000]   And so at that time, what's going to matter?
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.320]   Your money is going to have some importance at that point in time.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.840]   Your money is going to have some importance to your wife, to your children.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.240]   A friend of mine died of COVID.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.240]   Was that a young man?
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.240]   Young, had children, they were teenagers.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.720]   He was at his funeral last week.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.720]   I should say funeral with air quotes, right?
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.720]   Funerals in the time of COVID.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:53.040]   We all got together in a big field and there were little bubbles all around the field to
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.680]   try to remember his life.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.280]   I just was thinking afresh about death, right?
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.840]   Money matters at that time.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.840]   It matters.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:10.200]   But the time in between, right?
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   The dash, right?
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:17.360]   The dash between the two dates, that matters way more.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:22.320]   And as I listened to the testimonies of the friends and loved ones who spoke at a friend's
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:30.560]   funeral and talked about how the impact that he'd had on them, there wasn't a whole lot
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.720]   of money involved, but there were a lot of activities.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.840]   There was a lot of time.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:40.320]   There was a lot of presence.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:46.560]   The C, presence.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.560]   Judge accordingly.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.200]   I think I've said all I need to say.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.880]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
