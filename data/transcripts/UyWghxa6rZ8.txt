[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   First of all, we're social animals, so we all need them.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.640]   You're not going to get through this thing called life without them,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.880]   at least not successfully.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.240]   And if you look at the world we live in right now,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.080]   rising rates of depression and anxiety, inability to cope with stress,
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.920]   in the worst case scenario, suicide,
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.560]   what you find is that friendship fixes all those things.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.880]   It's the ultimate biohack.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.320]   Even the obsession with longevity.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.680]   You know, you've got everybody talking about diets and exercises and supplements,
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.320]   and yet nobody's talking about friends.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.440]   And if you look at all the blue zones and all of those things,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.000]   yes, they're eating these vegetarian diets, yes, they walk a lot,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600]   but they also commune, they also eat with friends, they also walk with friends.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440]   And I've met so many people who've lived to old age,
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.120]   who didn't do any of the things that the biohackers in Hollywood do,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.040]   and they're in their 90s, and they're happy, and they're healthy,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.680]   and they're walking around, and you hear them laugh and talk about their friends.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.640]   And so I think that we forget about friendship,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000]   because it's a little more amorphous, can't measure it as easily.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240]   You know, we live in a metrics-obsessed world.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.320]   We're so metrics-obsessed, we forget that some of the harder-to-measure,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.520]   more qualitative, beautiful things in life actually contribute to our health.
