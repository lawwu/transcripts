[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   So what I want to do is a core idea.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.800]   I think the series has been going well.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.560]   These, the core idea videos,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.160]   which we have been releasing as standalone videos
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.760]   at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.380]   have been some of the most popular videos
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.760]   we've been releasing.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.640]   When Jesse and I had the original idea
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.860]   for doing a series of core idea segments, I made a list.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.720]   Well, here are top of mind,
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080]   the core ideas I come back to again and again
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.040]   in my writing and on this podcast.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.900]   We have almost gotten through that entire list,
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680]   but there is one topic left on that original list,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.980]   and that is the topic I want to cover today,
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.020]   which is the case against email.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.080]   Now, this is the ideas that I fully articulated
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.100]   in my most recent book, "A World Without Email."
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.320]   I also explored a lot of these ideas
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.040]   in my New Yorker writing.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.120]   So if you look back at my New Yorker archive
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.680]   from before and even after the publication
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.520]   of "A World Without Email,"
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.460]   I also explored a lot of these ideas
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.320]   in the pages of the New Yorker as well.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.660]   I want to capture them all now in one core idea segment.
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.040]   There's four parts here that I want to tackle.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.600]   One, I'm going to introduce the notion
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.560]   of the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.040]   It's the most important piece of vocabulary
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.280]   that you will come away from this segment having learned.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.360]   If you listen to one thing, know this term.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.960]   Two, I want to get into why the hyperactive hive mind
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.120]   is such a villain in the context of modern knowledge work.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.520]   Three, I'm going to tackle if it's so bad,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.660]   why is it so common?
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.280]   And then four, we will briefly touch on,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.640]   so what should we do about it?
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.440]   All right, so that's my goal.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.800]   So let's start with this first point,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.720]   the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.280]   So the name of my book was "A World Without Email,"
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.280]   and I got any number of seemingly clever,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.560]   notes from people, often in response to,
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.000]   let's say a mailing list, mailing from my mailing list,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.800]   where they would say, "Ha, I'm reading an email from you,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.440]   and you are saying we should have no email in the world.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.600]   Gotcha," right?
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   They're joking, but I would get that comment a lot,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.120]   like how ironic is this?
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880]   And this is where I need to clarify
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.920]   that the issue that I come after in that book
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.480]   is not email by itself.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.440]   No particular beef with email as a technology.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.240]   The actual villain of that book,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.160]   the thing I think we should have banished more
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.720]   from our world is what I dubbed
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.100]   the hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.620]   Now, this is not an elegant title.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.720]   I couldn't call the book
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.960]   "A World Without the Hyperactive Hive Mind Workflow,"
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.640]   but that's probably what I should have named it
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.360]   because that is accurately what the book is really about.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.460]   So what is this thing, the hyperactive hive mind workflow?
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.600]   It is a means of collaboration
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.680]   in which the bulk of your collaboration
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   occurs with ad hoc, unscheduled digital messages.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.960]   So we're trying to figure something out.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.800]   I'll send you a message, you'll send me one back,
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   I'll bounce it back to you.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.200]   So maybe it's Jesse and I scrambling over the furor created
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.480]   when we mixed up Brandon Sanderson with Pat Rufus,
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.560]   and maybe I sent him an email,
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.640]   "Hey, what should we do about this?"
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.540]   He sends one back, like,
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.840]   "Well, maybe we should meet about it."
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.760]   And he's like, "Well, what about these times?"
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.200]   You're just sending messages back and forth.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.040]   They're ad hoc,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.480]   so it's not like you had a particular plan.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.320]   It's just in the moment,
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.960]   let me send this message, and they're unscheduled.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.520]   So there's not like a particular time
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.000]   when this communication is going to happen.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.140]   Email made the hyperactive hive mind workflow possible,
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.700]   but two key points here, it doesn't make it inevitable.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.840]   So having email around makes it possible
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.600]   for you to do ad hoc back and forth messaging
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.680]   as the main way that you coordinate,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.320]   but it doesn't mean that's the way you have to.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.840]   And two, once that became dominant,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.640]   other tools came along that made it even easier
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.600]   to engage in the hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.040]   So you got, for example, instant messenger tools
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.680]   like Slack, like WhatsApp,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.880]   they all are enabling the same workflow.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.720]   And it's this hyperactive hive mind workflow
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.180]   that I want to put our attention on.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.880]   So this brings us to the second point,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.280]   what's wrong with the hyperactive hive mind workflow?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.220]   Well, let me start by saying in the abstract, nothing.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.060]   It's actually a very natural way to coordinate.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.520]   It is in a pre-digital age,
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.800]   the primary way that human beings work together.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.920]   If there was three of you out hunting a mastodon,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.880]   it's a hundred thousand years ago,
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.040]   you would coordinate using the hyperactive hive mind workflow
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.160]   it'd be ad hoc back and forth, unscheduled messages.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.640]   Hey, you come over here, stop there.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.480]   I think he's over here.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.680]   You go around that way.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.880]   It's a natural way to human beings collaborate.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.120]   So there's nothing fundamentally wrong
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.560]   with it's very natural.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.000]   It's also quite flexible, right?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.960]   You have one tool, one communication tool.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.600]   You figure things out on the fly.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.280]   There's very little overhead,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.760]   very little predetermination required
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.640]   to figure out how to get things done.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.160]   We just sort of rock and roll and get things done.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.120]   So abstractly speaking, there's nothing particularly wrong
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.800]   with this mode of collaboration.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.000]   The issue is that it doesn't scale.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.400]   So email, the arrival of email made it possible,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.020]   made it possible for very large groups of people
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.400]   to coordinate with each other on a large number of things,
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.440]   all using this hyperactive hive mind.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.280]   Because now with almost no friction,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.880]   I can shoot off a message to almost anyone in my organization
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.240]   almost any of our clients, any of our contractors.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.200]   We have this very low friction simplified
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.880]   way of communicating.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.760]   It is in the scaling that the hyperactive hive mind
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.480]   began to weave its web of negative implications
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.400]   in the modern office.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.680]   And here's why.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.340]   Let's walk through this thought experiment.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.640]   If I work with one other person
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.720]   and we're working on one thing
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.280]   and we're not in the same room,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.580]   going back and forth with unscheduled email messages
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.280]   is a perfectly reasonable way for us to coordinate.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.400]   All right, well, did you get this?
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.240]   Should we meet?
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.060]   Well, when can you meet?
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.900]   What do you think about this?
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.720]   We could go back and forth.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.140]   It's a perfectly reasonable way for us to coordinate.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.020]   So let's say a typical thing,
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.060]   just so we can use round numbers.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.080]   So we want to coordinate about,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.200]   it's going to require about 10 back and forth messages.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.040]   That's fine.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.740]   10 back and forth messages over the course of a day or two,
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.900]   no big deal.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.580]   Now imagine like the typical knowledge worker,
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.220]   we've now scaled up the number of people we work with
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.780]   and the number of things we work on.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.180]   And now we have 10 different things that are going on.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.260]   A big project over here,
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.100]   a report that has to get to a client,
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.260]   trying to reschedule a visit with a candidate
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.980]   that's coming in to interview.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.940]   We're trying to figure out a problem,
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.660]   working back and forth with facilities
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.780]   because there's something that has to be repaired.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.700]   So we have like 10 different things going on.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.940]   Each of them are being worked out
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.860]   with the hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.080]   Each of them on average,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.440]   maybe it's going to require about 10 back and forth messages
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.440]   to figure out.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.440]   Each of them on average is relatively time sensitive.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.360]   We need to get a resolution in the next day or two.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.840]   So we have 10 messages for each of these things,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.360]   each of which needs to be seen, processed,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.600]   and replied to within the next day or two.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.760]   Let's multiply these numbers through.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.960]   10 things, 10 messages,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.840]   that's a hundred total messages that have to be seen,
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.780]   received, and replied to all within a day or two.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.580]   This is where we begin to get into trouble
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.780]   in the modern workplace,
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.500]   because now if there's going to be a hundred messages,
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.420]   I'm going to have to get through each of them
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.220]   in a relatively timely fashion.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.620]   In the next day or so,
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.240]   there is no alternative for me,
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.940]   but to constantly check
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.100]   whatever communication channel we're using.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.900]   If it's an email firm, I'm always in my inbox.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.460]   If we're a Slack firm, I have to keep checking Slack.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.680]   And the reason why I have to do this
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.860]   is not because I'm lazy, not because I'm bad at tools,
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.660]   but because there's a hundred messages
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.980]   that are going to have to be hit back
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.660]   over that virtual ping pong net
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.980]   pretty quickly after they arrive.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.920]   So I have to check constantly.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.500]   And the data on this shows this is exactly what we do.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.560]   In my book, I talk about a really good comprehensive data set
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.180]   from the software company RescueTime.
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.620]   They studied tens of thousands of knowledge workers
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.180]   and found that they were checking inboxes on average
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.900]   once every six minutes.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.140]   It's required.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.540]   If you have hundreds of messages
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.580]   that are going to have to be seen,
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.980]   each of which is going to have to be responded to
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.980]   relatively quickly, just so progress can be made
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.500]   on the various projects you're working on.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.140]   All right, so now we have a situation
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.700]   where we have to check an inbox or a chat channel
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.740]   once every six minutes,
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.500]   because this is the only way network is going to unfold.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.740]   Every one of those checks induces
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.580]   a cognitive context shift.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.580]   You see an inbox full of information,
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.820]   different than what you're primarily working on,
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.120]   a lot of which is urgent,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.260]   all of which is tied to specific individuals
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.700]   that need things from you.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.700]   That is a arresting context shift.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.340]   Your brain begins to immediately shift over its context
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.760]   to those things you see in your inbox.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.700]   Now, the issue is you're just checking your inbox real quick
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.960]   because you're seeing, hey, did the reply come back yet
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.420]   from Jesse about when we're going to set up our next meeting
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.500]   so you pretty quickly try to bring your attention back
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.340]   to what you're doing,
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.820]   but you've already induced that context shift.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.000]   That has a cost.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.080]   Your cognitive capacity is going to be reduced
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.100]   and for a while after that check,
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.780]   10, 15 minutes after that check,
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.720]   you're still going to have a reduced cognitive capacity
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.620]   as your brain is now in this intermediate state
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.140]   between what you were focusing on before
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.820]   and what you just saw, and then you stopped looking at that,
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.460]   you tried to go back to the main thing,
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.780]   you have what's called attention residue,
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.380]   cognitive capacity is reduced.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.220]   Not only that,
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.860]   but you're going to get a low grade sense of anxiety
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.300]   because you see all of these unresolved tasks
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.060]   in that inbox all tied to people
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.880]   and we take seriously requests from people
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   and you get an overall fatigue.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.080]   This is this burnout effect that office workers feel
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.360]   whereby two in the afternoon,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.320]   they're just done trying to do anything hard
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.520]   because they burnt out their brain,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.040]   shifting those contexts back and forth.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.220]   It's the shifts that kill you, the shifts that kill you.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.360]   So we've created a hyperactive hive mind scaled up,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.960]   creates this need to have to check inboxes or channels
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.180]   all the time because you have 100 messages a day
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.040]   that you have to hit back over the ping pong fence
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.540]   and you can't wait four hours to do that.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.740]   And all those context shifts completely fry our brain.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.700]   And so it's misery making, it's fatiguing,
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.940]   it's anxiety producing and we get a lot less done.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.800]   So it's a huge problem that we try to coordinate
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.540]   so much work with the hyperactive hive mind workflow,
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.380]   not because it doesn't make sense, it's very flexible,
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.220]   but because it doesn't scale.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.820]   At scale, it requires constant shifts
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.840]   and our brains simply can't do that.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.100]   So if the hyperactive hive mind is so bad,
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.880]   this brings us to our third point, why is it so common?
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.420]   Well, I looked into this in my book
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.440]   and in my New Yorker reporting,
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.180]   and here's the story I uncovered.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.520]   It is largely accidental.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.040]   No one ever said coordinating all of our work
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.020]   with these rapid back and forth unscheduled messages
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.880]   is gonna make us more productive.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.120]   No one ever said, look, there's gonna be some sacrifices
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.700]   to this, but it's gonna be the right way to work.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.760]   It's gonna unlock new levels of production.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.480]   No one ever thought that or said that.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.520]   We stumbled into this way of working
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.880]   and here's how it largely unfolded.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.640]   In the 1990s, email made a rapid move
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.800]   through the front office.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.760]   That is when most businesses that have standard computer
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.040]   cubicle style knowledge work adopted email
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.320]   and began to use it extensively.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.680]   And the reason they did, again, I went back to the archives,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.480]   was looking at the New York Times business section,
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.640]   I was looking at articles in other technology magazines,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.240]   trying to document, look at the documents
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.160]   of how people were talking about email
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.000]   when it first spread in the 90s.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.480]   The reason why email spread is not because they said,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   we will have this utopia where we can communicate
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.360]   with each other all the time.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.120]   It was because it was replacing three existing tools,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.860]   fax machines, voicemails, and interoffice memos.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.540]   It was a better version of those three tools,
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.760]   which were very popularly used in the decades
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.040]   leading up to the arrival of email
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.280]   and email was unquestionably a better way
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   of implementing that communication.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.000]   Attaching a file is much better than faxing,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.760]   sending an email is almost always much better
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.400]   than leaving a voicemail that requires someone
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.560]   to type in a code and listen to you actually talking.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.720]   Sending a CC message about the new parking policy
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.800]   to the whole office is clearly much more efficient
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.040]   than having to print that out
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.560]   and put it in everyone's mailboxes.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.800]   So it was solving a real problem,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.440]   which was there was asynchronous communication
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.000]   that existed, those three tools implemented it,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.880]   email was cheaper, had more features and was faster.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.920]   That's why it spread.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.520]   Once it was in people's offices though,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.200]   once people had those addresses,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.720]   once the friction was removed
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.200]   for any interpersonal communication,
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.740]   the hyperactive Hivemind workflow emerged naturally,
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.600]   not by choice, but naturally.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.680]   And why did it emerge?
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.760]   Well, this gets complicated,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.960]   but here's just a summary of it.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.060]   It emerged because we had an ethic of autonomy.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.280]   In the context of knowledge work,
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.960]   we had an ethic that in knowledge work,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.080]   it's up to individuals to figure out
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.480]   how to organize their work.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.000]   Productivity is personal, we said.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.440]   How you keep track of things,
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.560]   how you choose what you say yes to, no to,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.280]   how you manage your time during the day,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.040]   how you manage your tasks,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.900]   that's up to you as the individual.
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.840]   Buy a Cal Newport book, buy a Stephen Covey book,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.580]   buy a David Allen book, that's none of our business.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.920]   We give you objectives and we motivate you,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.300]   but you figure out how to do your work.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.160]   That is the dominant ethic in knowledge work
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.000]   for various reasons.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.440]   In that context where we leave the organization
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.500]   and execution of work up to the individuals,
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.000]   it is not surprising that when this new tool emerged,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.280]   we began to use it in the most flexible,
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.400]   easiest way possible.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.000]   The hyperactive Hivemind was convenient and flexible,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.520]   so we all sort of fell into it
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.140]   because there was no one looking down
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.300]   at the organization as a whole
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.800]   and saying, "What's the best way to do this work?"
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.880]   When we make our own decisions,
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.860]   we end up with whatever is easiest in the moment.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.980]   And so we stumble backwards in this swamp of autonomy
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.900]   towards a world in which the hyperactive Hivemind
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.700]   was dominant, and we look up,
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.180]   and by the early 2000s found ourselves context shifting
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.560]   every five to six minutes,
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.380]   miserable, barely able to get any real work done.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.980]   So that brings us to the final point,
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.400]   which is what should we do about this situation?
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.300]   Well, now that we know that it's largely accidental
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.500]   that we arrived here,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.980]   now that we know that there's more damage
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.080]   that we may have expected occurring
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.460]   because of all these context shifts,
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.600]   this should embolden us to seek solutions.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.780]   And in seeking these solutions,
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.500]   I think the first point we have to make
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.540]   is that this is not a game
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.880]   that is going to be one with individual habits.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.840]   This has been, up until most recently,
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.580]   the most common way we've tried to deal
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.860]   with the email problem, which is say,
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.860]   well, people are just using email wrong.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.100]   Don't check it so much.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.300]   You're addicted to it.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.720]   We introduced that terminology of addiction.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.220]   Remember when the hyperactive hive mind
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.460]   first began to emerge,
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.100]   and we first noticed it when people
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.060]   were using early generation blackberries all the time
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.160]   to keep up with the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.120]   we introduced the term crackberries
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.860]   and tried to make it seem like these people
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.780]   had some sort of weird addiction to this thing.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.040]   They need to get rid of that addiction.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.700]   It's orthogonal to their actual work, but it wasn't.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.220]   They're checking the blackberries all the time
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.560]   because there was more work being worked through
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.020]   with ad hoc unscheduled messages,
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.220]   and they had to respond to those messages
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.820]   for work to unfold.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.600]   It was required, not a flaw.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.220]   So we're not gonna solve this problem
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.520]   by saying just check your email less often,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.380]   or write better subject lines,
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.680]   or have better filters,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.580]   or if you move from Gmail to superhuman,
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.020]   or from superhuman to hey,
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.140]   that if you just have enough automatic filters and features,
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.620]   you can tame this problem.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.620]   You're just not handling email well.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.040]   But when we recognize that the problem
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.900]   is actually the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.180]   we know none of these individual habit fixes will be enough.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.180]   The reason why we have to keep checking our email,
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.500]   we have to keep checking Slack,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.380]   is not because we have bad habits or bad setups,
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.940]   but because we have 10 different things
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.780]   that are being organized with unscheduled messages,
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.140]   and we can't ignore those messages.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.660]   Each of these things has 10 messages
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.620]   that has to get sent back and forth today
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.700]   because we need to finish this by the end of the day.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.860]   So I have to keep checking,
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.120]   'cause if I wait four hours
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.500]   before I answer message number two,
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.900]   we're not gonna get the message number 10
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.740]   before the day is done,
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.580]   and it's a problem.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.660]   We check email all the time
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.700]   because the hyperactive hive mind demands it.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.780]   If that is the way we coordinate our work,
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.740]   there is no alternative
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.060]   to constantly checking in on these channels
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.340]   and keeping these messages bouncing back and forth.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.180]   Can't solve it by checking email less often,
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.340]   we can't solve it with better inboxes,
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.300]   we can't solve it by changing norms,
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.260]   we can't solve it with response time expectations changing.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.380]   You can say what you want about response time expectations.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.300]   We have 10 messages that have to get back and forth
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.900]   to schedule this visit tomorrow.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.380]   That has to happen.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.420]   Don't tell me our norm is
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.180]   don't expect an answer within 24 hours.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.780]   These 10 messages have to finish today
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.100]   because that person's coming tomorrow
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.340]   and we have to tell them what time their meeting is.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.640]   So how do we solve this problem?
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.860]   You replace the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.260]   We need alternative ways of collaborating
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.660]   that do not depend on unscheduled messages
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:19.660]   that require a response relatively quickly
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.600]   after they arrive in your inbox.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.220]   That is the only way to solve this problem.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.500]   And that is gonna require hard work.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.100]   It means we're gonna have to identify
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.540]   what are the different things we do again and again
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.260]   in my job in our office.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.960]   And for each of those things actually work out together
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.660]   alternative systems for collaboration
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.220]   that don't require unscheduled messages.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.900]   And each different type of thing you do
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.180]   might require a different system.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.700]   And each system might require polishing
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.380]   and optimization over time to get right.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.960]   And it's all a pain, but we have to do it.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.440]   Because the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.520]   though flexible, though convenient, though cheap,
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.000]   is not scaling and it's killing us
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.640]   from a cognitive perspective.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.200]   And so that is the main argument I make
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.560]   in the end of that book, A World Without Email.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.520]   We have to start building from the ground up
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.720]   bespoke, clearly specified systems of collaboration
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.320]   to talk about when and how we communicate
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.260]   to get things done.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:24.120]   Unscheduled messages have to play a decreasing role
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.140]   in coordinating work.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.560]   So when I talk about A World Without Email,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.640]   I mean a world in which the hyperactive hive mind
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.020]   is rarely used.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.780]   Regularly occurring work has clear systems
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.240]   for how we collaborate that don't depend
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.480]   on unscheduled messages.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.080]   I could care less, by the way, about other uses for email.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.000]   Your broadcasting information, great.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.320]   I don't want you to mail it to me, that's fine.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.160]   You have a non-urgent request or question
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.480]   I can answer in a sentence or two,
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.120]   yeah, email that to me and let me get to it
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.960]   when I wanna get to it.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.760]   That's a great use of email.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.540]   I'm happy with all of that.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.680]   The thing that's gonna kill us is we're going back
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.160]   and forth about something.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.560]   We gotta get that out of email.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.760]   We gotta get that out of Slack.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.960]   We gotta get that out of WhatsApp.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   And we have to put in place bespoke systems
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.320]   that say here's when and how we communicate.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.280]   Now we're not context shifting.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.820]   Now we're not exhausted.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.600]   Now we're not reducing our cognitive capacity.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.760]   Now we can actually produce work without burning out
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.080]   and be proud of what we produce.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.280]   So when I'm making my case against email,
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.920]   I'm making my case against the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.080]   And when we know that's the villain, we know the solution.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.600]   We have to vanquish that particular enemy.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.080]   And yes, it's a pain because we have to replace him
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.600]   with alternative ways of getting things done.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.360]   But work is not supposed to be about friction reduction.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.200]   Work is not supposed to be about what's easiest.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.280]   It's about what works.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.000]   By definition, work is resistance against objects at rest.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.600]   It's supposed to be hard.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.000]   So yeah, it's a pain to figure out.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.080]   For this client memo we produce every month,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.480]   instead of just rock and rolling on email,
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.640]   let's have a system where drafts go
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.760]   to these shared folders at these times.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.240]   And we use the comments and the designer knows
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.800]   that at this point he can grab what's
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.560]   in the shared document and design it.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.080]   And I'll sign off on it virtually.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.680]   And I have office hours every day.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.440]   And if you have questions, you come to my office hours.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.280]   That's when we discuss it.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.880]   You have to do stuff like that.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.720]   More overhead, more annoying, more delays.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.680]   But it gets rid of the need to have to check an inbox
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.520]   or check a chat channel,
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.380]   look for an unscheduled message and reply.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.520]   That is the key.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.820]   That is the world we need.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.400]   We have to get past this world where we just rock
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.600]   and roll with communication tools.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.260]   We have to get more bespoke and more structured.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.740]   But if we do, we're all gonna be much happier
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.600]   and we're gonna get a lot more done.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.600]   All right, so that is my core idea.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.640]   The last core idea from my original list
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.780]   of ideas I wanted to tackle.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.120]   There's other core ideas I'll do
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.920]   and feel free to send them suggestions to me.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.120]   You can send that in the interesting@calnewport.com.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.520]   Other things you've heard me talk about,
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.880]   you think we should do a core ideas video on,
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.720]   I'm happy to hear it.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.520]   But that was the original list.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.120]   So our playlist will soon be completely up to date.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.860]   (upbeat music)
