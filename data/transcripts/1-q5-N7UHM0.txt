[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   "He who abides in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.440]   I will say to Yahweh, 'My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.'
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.360]   For it is He who delivers you from the snare of the trapper and from the destructive pestilence.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.920]   He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you will take refuge.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.400]   His truth is a large shield and bulwark.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.320]   You will not be afraid of terror by night or arrow that flies by day, of pestilence
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.280]   that moves in darkness, or of destruction that devastates at noon.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.760]   A thousand may fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, but it shall not approach
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.760]   you.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.440]   You will only look on with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked, for you have
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.480]   made Yahweh my refuge, the Most High, your dwelling place.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.560]   No evil will befall you, no plague will come near your tent, for He will command His angels
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.140]   concerning you to guard you in all your ways.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.200]   On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.520]   You will tread upon the fierce lion and cobra, the young lion and the serpent.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.480]   You will trample down.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.000]   Because He has loved me, therefore I will protect Him.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.240]   I will set Him securely on high, because He has known my name.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.440]   He will call upon me, and I will answer Him.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.840]   I will be with Him in His distress.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.440]   I will rescue Him and honor Him with a long life.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.560]   I will satisfy Him, and I will show Him my salvation.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.060]   Amen.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:57.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
