[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.760]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.560]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so excited you're here today for our first live
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.080]   episode.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.800]   Now you're probably not hearing it live right now, but it was recorded live on
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.680]   Monday with a bunch of All The Hacks listeners joining in.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   And I wanted to do that because this is a really special episode.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.680]   Last Sunday marked the one-year mark from when I started the podcast.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.960]   So this is a big celebration for me.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.560]   And first off, I am so appreciative of everyone who has supported me along the
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.000]   way, made this possible, written in questions, feedback, hacks, all the guests
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   out there who've been on the show.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.920]   A tremendous thank you to everyone for everything you've done to support me and
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.520]   the show.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.000]   I am so excited to be doing it more and more.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.920]   I want to just share some of the exciting stats from the last year.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.120]   I went into this thinking, "Okay, let's do four or five episodes, see what
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.720]   happens."
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.120]   And it's been 55 episodes.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.160]   For anyone that is doing the math, that is not 52.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.960]   I did a few experiments throughout the past year where I'd post a small episode
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.600]   on a Thursday or on a Monday.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.240]   So that's the few extras.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.160]   The show has gotten over one and a half million downloads, which is about one and
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.960]   a half million more downloads rounded off than I anticipated getting started because
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.440]   I didn't know where this would go.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.120]   A couple of stats that I'm most excited about, I've had over 100 people have
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.520]   emailed in sharing stories of getting upgraded or going on a free trip that they
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.720]   otherwise wouldn't have.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.800]   And this took a little time, but I went and looked at all the emails I've gotten
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.520]   of people that have gotten signup bonuses or signed up for new cards.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.680]   And by my calculation, there have been at least 20 million points earned.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.600]   I hope that it's a lot more than that because I'm sure some people aren't
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.160]   writing in.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.240]   I'm excited for all the trips everyone's going to be taking and everything people
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.760]   can do.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.280]   And I don't have a metric for how much money we've saved collectively as a
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.480]   group, but I'm just going to make up a number and say it's in the millions of
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.360]   dollars as well.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.680]   A few check-ins for me, when I reflect over the past year, I thought about trying
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.840]   to summarize everything I've learned, but I feel like that would just literally be
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.480]   impossible because every episode, I'm learning so many things and actually
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.440]   putting them to use.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.480]   But I will say that thanks to the episode I did with Marshall Allen, number 34, I
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.960]   have so far gotten most of my medical bills from having to go to the ER twice
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.160]   reduced to nothing.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.840]   So that's been great.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.800]   I think I still have one out there that I'm trying to figure out, but I'm still
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.560]   optimistic that that will come down.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.200]   So I'm very appreciative of that and actually want to give a quick shout out
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.040]   to a listener.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.320]   Prema emailed me just in time last night to say that she's been fighting bills
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.840]   with all the tactics from episode 34.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.760]   And she was more successful than I was in that got the entire thousand dollars of
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.640]   medical bills reduced to a $20 copay.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.240]   So hearing stories like that are amazing.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.800]   I just got another one from Paul, who's a listener who took advantage of this
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.840]   upgrade program we launched recently, where if you're looking to book a five
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.640]   star hotel, we've got a network of thousands of hotels that we can help get
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.440]   upgrades at and free breakfast.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.600]   And he said that on his trip to Southern California, he and his wife were the most
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.880]   relaxed they've been in over 10 years, which I think it was their first trip
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.560]   without children.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.280]   So I can't say that we're responsible for that as much as being able to take a trip
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.240]   without their kids, but it really makes me so happy to hear any of these stories and
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.360]   all of them about people being able to put some of these tactics, some of these
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.200]   lessons into good use and really, really enjoy life even more than they could have
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.800]   otherwise.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.160]   I also want to touch on a couple things before we jump in to questions.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.880]   There are a few things that I'm thinking about for the upcoming year that I just
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.560]   want to share.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.840]   I've gotten so many people reaching out, asking questions, wanting to understand
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.000]   how other people are doing different things in the community.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.280]   And so I'm going to commit that this year, I'm going to try to launch -- not even
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.720]   try -- I'm going to launch a community for everyone, listeners, subscribers to the
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.960]   newsletter, etc.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.720]   And I'm trying to find the best platform and way to do it.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.960]   That means something where people can ask questions, people can interact with
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.440]   others, people can share the best deals they have.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.840]   A lot of the hacks I share are hacks that people have sent me.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.240]   So I want a place for all those things to live.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.280]   And this might not be as soon, but I really want to make becoming a part of
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.400]   the community beneficial for everyone.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.000]   So trying to negotiate and secure deals that are exclusive to the community,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.320]   offers, things like that are all things that I'm trying to think about with all
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.800]   the hacks for year two of the existence.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.080]   I've spent a lot of time thinking in the past year about the podcast and the
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.440]   newsletter and how to bring those together so that people can get value from both,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.640]   but they're not necessarily completely distinct.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.480]   And I'm going to keep doing that.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.160]   And hopefully people can get a lot from both those channels going forward.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.520]   Finally, another big thing.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.440]   I don't yet have a second baby.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.640]   Maybe by the time this airs, I will, who knows.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.640]   But at least during this live stream, I don't.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.000]   But bear with me for the next month because when baby two comes at any point
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.040]   in time, I don't know what that means.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.040]   Maybe an episode doesn't get out on time.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.840]   Maybe a newsletter doesn't get out on time.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.240]   But I really want to make sure that I'm there and can prioritize that moment.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.800]   If I go radio silent for a week or two, that's why.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.920]   And then none of this would have been possible.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.960]   I wouldn't have the time and the energy to do all of this without the
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.320]   support of a lot of people that also need to be mentioned.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.480]   Mauricio, Eric and his team at UpFire have helped with production and editing.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.960]   There's been a handful of people that have helped put together notes and
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.960]   ideas for some of the newsletters.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.640]   There's also a whole bunch of people helping with interviews.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   Nancy's been helping.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.920]   Jenna Savage is helping.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.200]   There's a bunch of people have written in to offer to help and I appreciate that.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.120]   The kinds of things, if you're interested in supporting the show in the future,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.920]   that are the most are little simple things like sharing it with someone.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.600]   That is literally the most meaningful thing anyone can do because my goal is to
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.480]   grow the show and create something bigger.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.120]   The bigger the community is, the more I can try to secure better partnerships,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.840]   better deals, better discounts for everyone in the community.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.840]   So helping me grow and share the show is the biggest thing you could do to help out.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.360]   And then a big thank you to all the sponsors we have on the show.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.640]   I don't think this would be possible without them.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.320]   I spend a lot of time looking at sponsors and vetting them because I don't want to
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.200]   have just anyone backing the show.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.560]   I want products I care about.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.640]   So a huge shout out to everyone that's done that.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.840]   We actually have a few of them who are going to be doing some giveaways as part
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.800]   of this, so I'll just mention it on the outset and then I'll explain a little
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.000]   more details at the end.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.880]   But Viori, which I'm literally wearing a Viori shirt and Viori pants right now,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.200]   is going to be giving away a $100 gift card as part of this celebration.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.680]   Emmanuel from Card Pointers, who's I know in the live stream right now.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.520]   It's a fantastic app.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.880]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.840]   He's going to give away a free lifetime membership.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.000]   And then I figured why not?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.680]   I give back.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.720]   I'm going to just take 10,000 Capital One points and just transfer them to someone.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.240]   So I'm giving away some Capital One points.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.880]   Unfortunately, Capital One, if you're listening, I would much rather you give
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.520]   them away.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.440]   But since you're not interested, or at least I'm not aware, I'll give them away
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:02.960]   myself.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.400]   So that's going to happen at the end.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.360]   I'll give all the details of how that's happening.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   But to all the other sponsors that have made this possible, thank you so much.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.200]   I want to jump in.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.840]   I got a few questions by email, so I'm going to start with those.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.000]   But hopefully everyone's here because they have things they want to know.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.320]   So first question, I got a couple emails about this over the years.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.680]   So Colin wrote a question in a few days ago asking about how to maximize points
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.160]   trying to buy a house.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   And this is a kind of question where I don't have a good answer for you.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.720]   I have bought a house a few times and in none of them was I able to maximize
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.160]   points.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.520]   I am not aware of a single way that buying a home can help you earn points,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.920]   which is a bummer because it's a massive purchase other than using services that
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.600]   charge fees.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.600]   So that's not a rewarding answer.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.440]   There have in the past been banks that offer really big sign up bonuses to get a
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:57.840]   mortgage.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   So they'll say, "Get your mortgage with us and we'll give you 100,000 points."
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.040]   But all of those things have always come at the cost of usually the interest rate
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.320]   or closing costs or fees.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.880]   And so I think that is just not something worth it.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.680]   The follow up to that was, "What about buying a car?"
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.320]   And Colin asked the same question.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.560]   That on the other hand, I think it is a negotiable thing.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.800]   So when you buy a car from a dealership, the dealer will often take some portion
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.640]   of a down payment on a credit card and they're just going to eat the fee.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.720]   But that's something you can negotiate.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.160]   So unless you're buying a Tesla online where I don't think there's a way to do
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.640]   it, it is possible to put part of your down payment for your car on a card.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.840]   And I would say the limit there might only be the limit of your card and the
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.480]   limit of what you can get the dealership to accept.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.240]   So if that's something you're thinking about, I would definitely encourage you
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.600]   to push and negotiate there.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.480]   Actually, I stand corrected.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.200]   Michael in the chat just shared that if you're buying a Tesla, if you remove the
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.040]   add-ons like full self-driving from the purchase price, you can actually upgrade
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.680]   it after and pay with a card.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.160]   Given that it costs about $10,000, you could probably meet a full signup bonus
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.400]   minimum spend in one go, though it'd probably mean you won't be able to
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.120]   finance it, so keep that in mind as well.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.480]   I love learning these kind of hacks from listeners, so please keep them coming in
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.120]   the chat, by email, Twitter, Instagram, DM, or anywhere else.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.560]   I might actually use Michael's hack if the Tesla we ordered that keeps getting
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.800]   delayed ever ends up coming.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.960]   So thank you so much.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.120]   I'm going to do one more email one, which was from Chad about flexibility and what
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.160]   being flexible means when it comes to booking.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.480]   He pointed out, rightfully so, that you have to be flexible.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.680]   And he's like, "Hey, you took this trip and you waited until the last minute.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.920]   Is that always possible?
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.840]   What about for hot destinations versus not?
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.120]   Having backup destinations, how that works?"
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.240]   So what I always say with points is there's kind of two times that are the most ideal.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.560]   It's like as far out as possible and as last minute as possible.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.160]   Now that doesn't mean you can't use points other ways.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.760]   And that doesn't mean I haven't taken trips with less flexibility than that.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.520]   But anytime you can reduce one area of where you want to go, when you want to go,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.760]   what airline or what type of travel you want to take, whether it's in business or
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.720]   coach, reducing one complexity makes things easier.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.320]   If you can reduce more, it's even better.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.960]   I always say if you're looking to be flexible, that doesn't mean you have to
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.440]   plan super far in advance.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.000]   It might mean you need to be flexible with what day of the week you're traveling.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.400]   It might mean you might need to be flexible with taking a layover somewhere
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.200]   else, or maybe even buying a ticket, often called a positioning flight.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.720]   So if you live in, let's say, Las Vegas, you might not be able to find the award
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.200]   flights you want, but if you're flexible to buy a $100 ticket to LA or to San
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.480]   Francisco, or maybe to Phoenix, you might be able to get an award flight you
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.600]   wouldn't have otherwise gotten.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.480]   So when I think of flexibility, it's in all of those ways.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.880]   If you're willing to fly anytime, anywhere, I think you can
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.200]   probably go wherever you want.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.720]   And the big cool thing about last minute stuff and the positive outcome for at
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.400]   least award travel with the pandemic is that with a lot of change and cancellation
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.280]   fees being waived, you can book with miles.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.880]   And then if something opens up better, you can usually change or
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.120]   cancel and rebook at the last minute.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.680]   So there've been times where I ended up booking a flight that I didn't think
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.560]   was as ideal as the alternative.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.760]   It was maybe two layovers and then went to the airport one day, like four hours
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.680]   early, something opened up, canceled and rebooked at the airport.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.240]   I was flexible in the last minute to change because I was flexible early on
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.720]   to take something that was less than ideal.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.560]   Okay.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.000]   So I'm going to scroll up, hit on Weber's question.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.000]   Thanks for asking, "Where would you stay in London for a luxury splurge?"
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.320]   Well, this is a question I definitely have no clue how to answer.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.400]   The last time I was in London, I distinctly remember being very young
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.880]   and having a Discman and listening to Alanis Morissette's new album that
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.040]   just came out, which can tell you how long ago that was.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.120]   So I literally have no idea where I would recommend staying, but I'll tell
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.880]   you how I would if I were taking a trip.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:03.120]   So Weber's got 150,000 Marriott points, 100,000 Chase points and 80,000 Amex
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   points and can transfer to British Airways to take the nonstop flight from
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.640]   Austin, but what do you do for hotels?
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:15.480]   So when I'm thinking of hotels with points, it's unfortunate that
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.280]   there aren't a ton of great options.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.960]   I've accumulated some Marriott points.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.840]   And so using those for Marriott, great.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.400]   If I have Chase points, transferring those to Hyatt is great.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.320]   And Weber, I'm trying to make this as broadly applicable.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.360]   I know some of this might not be relevant, but I want to emphasize
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.520]   that outside of using points in a hotel chain that you already have or using
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.920]   the hotel credit card to earn them and transferring points to Hyatt, I don't
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.800]   actually think using points to book hotels is the best way to use points.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.720]   I wish it was, it just unfortunately is not the best transfer rate.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.480]   So I typically, if I'm not doing Hyatt or Marriott, I'm looking to pay for
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.160]   hotels and when I'm looking for deals, I'm using sites like Google hotels,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.640]   like the same kind of common search engines to find them.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.960]   And then using the tactics we've talked about a number of times on the show of
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.080]   booking directly with the hotel, reaching out and looking for the upgrade.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.600]   So hoping for the upgrade helps a lot of times, if you're looking for luxury,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.160]   that's one of the things that we have a partnership with Savanti, the company
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.440]   that Lee Rowan, who's been a guest on the show a few times, runs where we can
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.840]   try to help hook up the different types of upgrades, early check-in, late
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.880]   checkout, free breakfast, sometimes a property credit, all that kind of stuff.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.400]   So if I'm looking at you with 150,000 Marriott points, I would
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.520]   do that search on Marriott.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.800]   If the chase points are available, I would transfer them to Hyatt and I
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.840]   would just try to find the best thing you can, otherwise I'd be searching
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.680]   for the cheapest prices for the best hotel and reaching out to try to get deals.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   All right, Mallory, I don't know where you are to unmute you, but feel
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.560]   free to unmute and ask this question.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.200]   Hey everybody.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.800]   I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point.me, my favorite
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.360]   award search tool, to give you a special offer of only $1 for your first
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:07.040]   month of their standard plan, if you go to allthehacks.com/pointme and
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.640]   use the promo code HACKS.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:16.080]   Again, allthehacks.com/P-O-I-N-T-M-E or find the link in the show notes.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.480]   So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with points.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:26.400]   So my question is when you're at the beginning of a trip plan, where
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.360]   you've just decided the location, but don't really know what you're going
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.680]   to be doing or where you're going to be staying, what's your process for
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.880]   figuring out what cards to get and when to open them, what order and how long
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.640]   to wait in between opening them?
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.760]   Like, for example, I'm trying to plan a big trip to Japan next winter, but
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:52.000]   I really don't have any idea of where to start card-wise for making sure
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.880]   that I can cover most of the trip with points.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.120]   So great question.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.240]   And if anyone listening hasn't been to Japan, you're on the right track.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.920]   It's amazing.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.560]   So when I'm thinking of a trip and trying to figure out how I can make the
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:11.680]   trip free, I sometimes like to do some quick searching about award sweet
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.040]   spots for Japan, right?
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.720]   In your case or any country.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.760]   And you'll try to get a sense of "Is there an airline that has some of the
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.120]   best flight deals with points to Japan?"
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.120]   So I happen to know that ANA is one of those airlines, and I can't remember
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.080]   the exact number of points off the top of my head, but I think in business
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.880]   class, it's something like 80 or 90,000 points round trip, which is way better
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.960]   than a lot of other options.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.800]   So if I found a country I was going to, and there was a particular airline that
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.920]   was like the best deal for booking, I would consider trying to earn points in
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.200]   a program that will transfer to that airline.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.080]   So in this case, Amex is a partner of ANA, 100,000 Amex points might get you
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.960]   to Japan in business class because you can go through ANA, but 100,000 Chase
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.200]   points might not because there might not be a Chase partner that has as good of
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.840]   a deal for booking flights to Japan.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.760]   When it comes to flights, that's what I'm thinking about.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.840]   The other aspect is just what's most flexible, right?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.200]   Earning United points would be much less flexible than earning Chase or Amex or
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.240]   Built or Capital One points because you can only use them on one airline versus
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.320]   a lot. Second, I would be thinking about is what are the big offers right now?
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:30.480]   I'd rather have 100,000 Amex points than 50,000 of almost any other point.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.080]   So when I think about trying to plan a trip this far in advance, I'm thinking,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.960]   what are the big signup bonuses that are available right now?
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.680]   The Chase Sapphire Preferred at 80,000 right now is a big one.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.160]   I think that Amex Platinum is still at 100,000, which is a big one and just
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.040]   depends. I think the Venture X card is still at 75,000 points, which is another
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:57.200]   big one. So I try to keep track of what's a big opportunity right now and then be
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.440]   opportunistic. If there's a card that launches something with a huge signup
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.120]   bonus, maybe be ready to take advantage of that.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.480]   And as many of you know, I have a page set up at allthehacks.com/cards where I
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.960]   link to the latest signup bonuses and card offers.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.640]   When you sign up for a card there, you're supporting me and the show.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.400]   So thank you so much to those of you that have done it already and to anyone in the
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.480]   future who does it. I really appreciate it.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.400]   As far as waiting between card signups, I've kind of heard it's best to wait 45 to
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.280]   60 days between signups.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.440]   It usually takes me at least that long to spend enough to meet the minimum spend.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.160]   So that's how I think about it in advance.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.320]   When it comes to hotels, I think it really is location dependent.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.880]   Some locations, even really nice hotels are cheap enough that it might not even make
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.000]   sense to worry about points.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.080]   There are a lot of really high end hotels in Thailand that using points might not
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.560]   even make sense. If cash flow is a thing, use the portal to book them, then even
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.840]   worry about transferring them.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.480]   But for example, you mentioned Japan.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.160]   The Park Hyatt's are like thousand plus dollar a night hotels that you can book
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.560]   with 40,000 Hyatt points.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.560]   If you want to go all out, I was lucky to stay at the Park Hyatt in Kyoto.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.880]   And it's literally like the nicest hotel I've probably ever stayed at and was a
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.720]   great deal with points. And that was with Hyatt.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.080]   So I would be thinking if there's a hotel that I'm really excited about, I would be
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.400]   trying to earn the points in that hotel program.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.880]   Maybe that means getting the Hyatt card because those points are gonna be extra
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.920]   valuable or chase which transfers there.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.080]   If there were a Ritz Carlton or a St.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.080]   Regis, I might look at a Marriott card because I have a particular use case for
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.920]   those points and get that in advance.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.480]   Then I leave some room for flexibility.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.080]   You said you're going to Japan. I don't know exactly which city.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.880]   I would be open to starting to think about where I want to go and building that
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.120]   around availability.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.200]   So sometimes there might be, "Oh, well, this one hotel is only got these four
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.760]   days. Maybe I plan around that.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.360]   I only find flights this week.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.400]   Maybe I plan around that."
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.120]   I think if you have enough flexibility, you could kind of organize the trip in the
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.080]   most cost effective way for your points by maybe changing the order of the cities
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.680]   you visit or the day you fly.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.960]   And then I wouldn't be afraid to not always use your points.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.840]   So like the train in Japan is really efficient.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.480]   I don't think there's a good way to use your points on it.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.360]   I wouldn't force yourself to try to use your miles to fly between cities if the
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.400]   train's more convenient.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.160]   Also, the experience of the train in Japan is worth taking.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.600]   So I think, yeah, that's what I often do.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.160]   Awesome. Thank you so much.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.840]   I do have a follow up question, if that's OK.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.120]   OK, so it's given me a lot of anxiety to try to figure out all the rules,
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.880]   especially like Chase 524 in relation to this trip.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.680]   I've already used a lot of Chase spots for a past Disney trip that I covered with
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:49.040]   points. So now I'm afraid if I use the American Express points, that's all you
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.560]   can get. You get them and then that's it.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.000]   It seems like especially now, since there's a lot of stipulations on cards, if
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.680]   you get one IHG card or Southwest card, then you can't get another type of
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.360]   rewards card of that same family.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.200]   I'm very new to it, so I'm still trying to figure all that out.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.080]   I don't know if you have any advice on that aspect of it.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.360]   There are a lot of rules about this.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.760]   The big one, 524 is Chase has a rule that I just talked about at length with Julia
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.280]   on a recent episode.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.640]   It was the last episode, if you're here live.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.480]   So definitely listen there.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.360]   I would say there are apps and one of them is doing a giveaway today.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.400]   Card Pointers, it's an app where you can add these cards, keep track of your 524
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.160]   status. We're going to give someone here or that enters from the podcast a free
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.680]   lifetime subscription to Pro.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.800]   I use it to track what are all my cards, where am I going to spend for different
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.680]   categories, what credits am I using, how long has it been since I opened this
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.920]   card. So one answer, which isn't the full answer, is to track everything in one
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.080]   place. The other answer is you're going to have to look around because the rules
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.440]   change and the rules are different.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   So it's not the perfect answer to say, oh, go search IHG card.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.800]   What are the rules? Chase, what are the rules?
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.600]   But the one thing I will say is if you are looking to get a card, there are cards
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.880]   that business cards often if you're in the situation to have a business and a
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.960]   business doesn't mean you own a business with thousands of employees, it could
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.720]   mean you have a freelance business, you generate some kind of income, you don't
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.400]   even always need an EIN from the IRS to get a business card.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.600]   And they don't usually count towards the 524.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.720]   So if you've already opened up five cards in the last 24 months, it can be hard to
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.920]   get approved for a chase card.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.600]   But if you open a business card, that doesn't count towards the limit.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.160]   So if you're at that four, you're like, I've opened four chase cards, you can open
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.160]   a business card, you'll be able to get it because you're under five and then it
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.000]   won't count towards the five and you can get another one.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.480]   So I typically say open up the chase cards first, accept business cards before
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.600]   that so that you're staying under those limits.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.080]   Perfect. Thank you so much.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.200]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.280]   reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.120]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.000]   I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens and I am excited to be partnering
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.200]   with them for this episode.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.200]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I've
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.640]   kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.600]   Every morning I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.880]   It tastes so good when it's cold and I head to my office feeling focused and
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.440]   energized for the day, which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.200]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, and super
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.160]   foods and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.280]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.960]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.600]   year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.920]   with your first purchase.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:58.240]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.760]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens to take ownership over
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.280]   your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.360]   You all know I love credit card points, so I'm excited to be partnering with
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.240]   Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.440]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.040]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.640]   purchase.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.120]   You can also load it on your partner's phone so they always know the best cards
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:30.680]   to use.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:35.640]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:41.840]   over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.920]   America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.720]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.800]   Chase offer in just one click.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.280]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.120]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.040]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well, but if you
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.600]   want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.960]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:17.880]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:22.920]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.280]   Brandy says, "How do you decide personally when to maximize points and when to just
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.000]   spend the money?
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.320]   You could spend hours maximizing points, but at some point, the value of the
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.720]   savings is probably outweighed by the value of the time.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.840]   How do you avoid becoming obsessive?"
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.640]   This is a skill that I am still working on.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.760]   I think the answer I would give for someone thinking about this is to always
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.680]   kind of think about what your time is worth.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.160]   I know it's difficult and we typically undervalue our time.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.920]   But one thing that helped me was when my wife was working at Lyft, I signed up to
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.720]   be a Lyft driver.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.360]   And I was like, "Okay, now I know exactly how much at a floor I could make going to
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.440]   do something at any time."
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.800]   So if I'm going to spend more time than I would make doing that as an hourly rate,
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.680]   that gave me a mental answer.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.160]   And then I looked at my options.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:15.360]   So there are services where point.me as a concierge, Book Your Award, I can link to
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.320]   more in the show notes that will go through this entire process of "I want to
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.720]   book a flight here, go search all the options and come back to me."
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.840]   And they typically cost anywhere from $100 to maybe $300, depending on the
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.320]   complexity of the trip, the number of people and where you're going and what
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.640]   cabin you're traveling in.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.880]   And so I'm like, "Okay, if this is going to take me 30 hours, it's probably worth
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.520]   it to hire a service to do this."
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:43.320]   And many of them come with a guarantee that if they don't find something either
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.920]   better than you've already found or something at a reasonable price, they'll
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.560]   refund you.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:54.000]   So my approach typically is, "Let's do a search on my own.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.360]   Let's spend half an hour and just see if I find anything good and get a sense of
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.320]   how hard it's going to be."
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.720]   Like when we were going to Bora Bora, it's like, "Are there flights every day or
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.600]   are there flights like once a month?"
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.440]   And if I do a search and it's every day, I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to be able to
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:09.920]   handle this."
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.560]   If it's like once a month, I'm like, "Okay, if I have enough flexibility, maybe
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.080]   it's easy.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.320]   But if I didn't have a lot of flexibility and it looks like there's not a
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.160]   lot of availability, I would definitely try to hire a service to help out."
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.000]   However, early on, I wanted to understand how it all worked.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.600]   I was fascinated by it and I loved spending time on it.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   So I would just go down the rabbit hole.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.320]   And if I spent 10 hours checking 100 sites, it didn't feel like work to me.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.240]   But now that I think I have more responsibilities in life, I just can't
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.360]   spend 10 hours going down that rabbit hole.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.800]   That's a little bit about how I think about booking an award versus hiring
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.240]   someone to help book an award.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.000]   When it comes to just spending the money, I get a pretty good sense when I'm
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.560]   looking at a flight, whether it's going to be available at a lower cost.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.720]   And what I mean by that is on United, you can book almost any flight with miles.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.000]   It just sometimes might cost an insane number of miles.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.960]   And if you look at Hilton, when we're looking at Bora Bora, it wasn't that you
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.640]   couldn't book it.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.320]   It was just that on the days that it wasn't 100,000 points a night, it was a
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.280]   million points a night.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.240]   And so if I start to realize that all the days I'm looking for are going to be at
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:23.160]   that like insane, crazy price, then I usually will just say, "If this is a trip
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.480]   I need to take on these days, then I'm just going to pay for it."
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.760]   There's not a cents per mile where it makes sense.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.680]   Sometimes it's, "I just want this trip to be free.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.080]   And I don't want to deal with the expense of the trip this month."
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.640]   And it's okay if it's at a lower number of points per mile.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   I'd rather you take the trip than get the most out of your points because I
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.760]   think travel is amazing.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.880]   So Jared asked about elite status and whether I value them.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.360]   I'll just talk broadly for a moment.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.680]   I think there was a time in my life where I was traveling a lot for work and status
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.440]   on airlines and hotels was really, really important.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.800]   And I remember going on a mileage run where I just flew to Kansas City for the
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.160]   day.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.560]   I didn't even have to go to Kansas City.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.080]   There was nothing to do.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.000]   I just flew there, sat at the airport and flew back so that I could get, I think,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.560]   United status for that year.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.680]   And I got to a point where it just felt like you now need the highest, highest
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.720]   tier of status on any airline to ever get an upgrade.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.160]   And it can never be reliable.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.240]   And I got to the point that I was like, "I either want the upgrade or I don't
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:22.720]   care."
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.560]   And chasing status with airlines just wasn't worth it.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.680]   And so I was like, "If I have the miles or the points, I'll just use them to fly
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.200]   in business if I want to.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.240]   And I'm not going to worry about trying to chase the status to maybe get the
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.760]   upgrade."
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.320]   And most of the time, I think that in the long run, that's been the better
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.120]   decision.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.320]   So that's how I think about airline status.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.240]   Hotel status is a little different because the highest tier of hotel status on most
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.480]   chains usually includes breakfast at the hotel.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.240]   And that has a tangible value.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.720]   So for me, I think if I'm going to stay at enough hotels in the year, I know how to
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.560]   calculate that.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.240]   So Marriott status, for example, I've had for almost 6 years.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.480]   And it's been worth trying to stay at a few extra Marriott's to get free
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.040]   breakfast.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.600]   But I'm slowly coming to the point that I think I would be happier if I just
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.240]   prioritize the hotel I want, the place I want, and take away some of the stress
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.120]   that we talked about earlier in Brandy's question of like, "Oh, now I need to book
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:25.600]   in this chain."
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.280]   So for me, I think I started out valuing elite status a lot more.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.880]   And in the past year, I think I've just let it become less important, maybe the
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.800]   last few years.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.720]   Andrew said, "My company likes us to use IHG for work travel.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.080]   So I have elite status and the points there already.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.720]   And the discussion here is about Hyatt and Marriott.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.960]   Should I try to get out of IHG or is there a good way to leverage my perks?"
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.560]   I actually don't have a problem with IHG as a hotel chain.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.400]   The challenge is if you don't have IHG points, then I think it's really tricky.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.360]   So you already have IHG points, which is fantastic.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.120]   The reason why is that a lot of times, if you look at how many points you earn per
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:10.400]   dollar on a Marriott card or an IHG card, depending on the card, it can be on a
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.680]   hotel stay, you end up earning like 10 points per dollar on some of these hotel
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.840]   stays when you combine the hotel, the card, and everything.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.800]   When you're looking at spending money on a regular card, you're earning 2, 3, maybe
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.840]   5 points if it's an Amex on a flight.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.160]   So you can earn a lot of hotel points on different chains at a much higher rate on
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.480]   the per point level staying at them.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   So if I were saying a lot of IHG points, you could rack up a lot of IHG points and
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.480]   have awesome trips and there's some amazing IHG hotels.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.200]   The challenge is when you go to transfer points to IHG from their partners, which
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.760]   off the top of my head, I can't remember, but let's pretend it's Amex, you're just
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.240]   going to get one IHG point per dollar.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:57.440]   So I don't love using flexible points with Chase or Amex or Bilt or anywhere else to
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.680]   transfer to hotel partners that are not Hyatt because I just don't think the rate is
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:02.960]   good.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:09.000]   Like a hotel on Hyatt, the highest end is like 40,000 points and a hotel on the
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.960]   highest end on Marriott and IHG and Hilton can be over 100,000.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:18.400]   So if I'm using Amex points or Chase points and they're going to one to one, it's
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.200]   just not a great value transferring to IHG, transferring to Marriott.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.480]   Whereas when I can go one to one from Chase or Bilt to Hyatt, it is a really good
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:27.800]   value.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:33.400]   That said, if you can stay at a lot of IHGs and earn points there, I'm all for going
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.360]   deep on IHG, getting the credit card, earning the bonus points, working for elite
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:37.960]   status.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.160]   And that's kind of in effect what I've done with Marriott for almost half a decade
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:48.040]   or more is stay in lots of Marriott, use the Marriott card, earn over a million
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:48.840]   Marriott points.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:54.280]   I've just never transferred points from credit cards to Marriott because I don't
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:54.960]   think it's a good deal.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:00.120]   So I would say if there's a hotel chain that you're fond of that isn't Hyatt, that
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   doesn't mean don't use it.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.760]   It just means the best way to earn those points is going to be from staying at that
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.360]   chain or using the card for that chain.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.120]   And it's not going to be from flexible points programs.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:10.920]   I'll just share.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.960]   Jared said, if you can find someone with an Amex gold, they're running a 90,000
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.440]   point signup bonus plus 20% off restaurants for a few months, if you can get
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.120]   referred to the card by someone with that offer.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.000]   That's awesome.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.160]   I don't think I knew that.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.200]   I have an Amex gold.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.960]   I'm happy to refer people, but this is exactly why I want to build this kind of
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.920]   all the hacks community.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.640]   I want to be able for Jared, who I'm guessing knows this because he has one, to
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.520]   be able to share that link with the community, share this stuff with people.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.760]   And this is kind of what an experiment that I wanted to run is what happens when
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.880]   you get a few people in a room and I'm seeing people sharing ideas.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.520]   And that's what I'm really hoping to do.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:49.160]   So hopefully before the end of the year, there's a place for those kinds of tips
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.440]   to be shared, for people to share those with each other and help everyone out.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.880]   Also, Emmanuel from Card Pointers pointed out that there's still a resi offer for a
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.520]   75,000 point Amex gold offer with 20% at restaurants.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.000]   So if you search that, I'll also link it in the show notes.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.200]   Brandy said a competitor to Card Pointers doesn't allow you to track points from the
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.760]   two different accounts at the same bank.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.080]   Does Card Pointers allow for that?
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   So Card Pointers, to their benefit, but maybe to the detriment of the feature
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.120]   you're looking for, relies on a massive database.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.080]   They've got like 4000 different cards in their database.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.200]   So you don't actually have to link your accounts.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.000]   So Card Pointers is not a place to track your points amongst all of your balances
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.760]   in one place.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.080]   Unfortunately, I haven't found a good solution for that.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.920]   I know that the Points Guy has an app that does it.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.400]   I know Award Wallet does it.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.720]   And unfortunately, I don't think any of them work across everything.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.880]   So you're having to do some stuff manually.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.480]   So sadly, I end up just doing it all in a spreadsheet.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.480]   What Card Pointers does is says, "Okay, we know you have an Amex Platinum.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.000]   We know you opened it when the 100,000 point signup bonus was there.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.240]   And we know that means you need to spend 6,000.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.720]   So make sure you do that and let us know when you do and we can check that off your
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.000]   list." But it's not tracking it in real time by linking with your banks.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:10.120]   I don't know of a great service that can track across multiple banks, across
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.120]   multiple accounts.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.760]   Award Wallet would be the closest thing to that.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.040]   I would love someone to build that.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.760]   I think the Points Guy wants to, but I have the same concern there, which is I use
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.600]   their app and I can't sync both me and my wife's stuff.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:27.400]   So and then below that, and I'm going in order, Emmanuel said he's working on a
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.640]   specific card recommendation system, which takes into account all the bank rules.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.040]   So to the question before about managing all those rules, it sounds like that's
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.480]   coming in the next big update for Card Pointers.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.240]   JC asks, "How do I keep all the information notes for a podcast organized?"
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.560]   I want to do an episode in the next month or two about all the tools I'm using for
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:50.720]   everything. But specifically for the podcast, I run everything through a product
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.640]   called Notion, which I think it's like Google Docs/Wiki.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.480]   I don't really even know how to pitch it best.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.040]   So if Notion, if you're out there and you want to sponsor the show, I promise I'll do
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.840]   a better job because I love the product.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.800]   But I organize everything.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.840]   It's kind of has its own mini databases where I can link things.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.560]   So I actually have a whole like a Kanban board, which is like I move cards through
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.960]   different stages of guests and where are they?
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.000]   Have I reached out to them?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.680]   Did we commit to a time?
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.560]   Have we recorded?
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.360]   And then that pipes into another database that I use for each episode so I can line
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.400]   up that interview of a guest with a specific episode.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.240]   There's another database of sponsors.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.200]   But it all works together and looks mostly like Google Docs does or kind of like an
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.280]   old school wiki where you can edit things, have collaborators and comments and
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.720]   everything. So I go into each guest's page on Notion and I put in notes before the
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.200]   interview. And I keep that pulled up during the interview so that I can reference it.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.040]   I go in and I write down notes about sponsors and I even track which ones I'm
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.160]   excited about coming up, all of that, all in Notion.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.440]   So if you have any project, I highly recommend Notion.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.560]   My wife and I use it for all kinds of other stuff with our family.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.800]   So we actually have a Hutchins and Fox family Notion board where right now we're
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.040]   going back and forth commenting on baby names.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.240]   We keep all of our like frequent flyer numbers in one place.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.760]   We used to use it to track things when we were having the first baby of all of our
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.840]   registry items and things we need to buy.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.400]   So Notion is the place I go for all of that kinds of stuff.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.840]   But I do want to do an episode where I dive into all of the different tools.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.960]   So expect that, let's call it sometime this summer.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.840]   All right, Mallory, another one.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:35.680]   "Any tips for low income individuals using points for travel, especially from slower
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.480]   spending to reach the sign on bonuses, the cards with higher annual fees, figuring out
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.680]   spending that just isn't covered by points when traveling?"
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.280]   So I'm a big fan.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:49.400]   Episode 5 with Scott Kyes, Scott's Cheap Flights is an awesome newsletter that I've
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.880]   used just to track for years about best deals.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:58.200]   So when it comes to flights that aren't with miles, I found some great deals there.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.600]   The Google Flights destination search where you could just leave a destination off and
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.040]   find where is this cheapest place to go is fantastic.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   In the episode 55 with Julia, we talked about buying clubs, which is something that I am
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.720]   not the expert on, but I would definitely recommend a listen for helping meet minimum
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.280]   spend.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.160]   There are these clubs where effectively, people who often for export reasons, want to buy
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.000]   like a lot of a certain thing that's limited like an iPad or something like that, they
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.480]   will basically pay you to buy it and ship it to them.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.960]   So that's a way to earn minimum spend.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.640]   If you have a card that pays cashback or points, I don't typically encourage or like to
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.800]   buy points unless you have a redemption in mind.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:48.040]   But a card like the Venturex card, which earns two points per dollar that you could cash
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.760]   out, you can pay your taxes on them.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.000]   So if you owe taxes, if you don't mind giving the government a loan, you can pay your
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.520]   taxes.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.000]   Even if you overpay them, you'll get a refund and they'll send them back to you.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.720]   So I don't like doing that to earn points because I just don't think paying 1.87% to
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.680]   earn points is worth it.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:10.760]   But if it's a 2% cashback card that you need to hit a minimum spend on, then you could
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.840]   use paying your taxes as a way to hit that minimum spend and get the big bonus.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.960]   That's another tactic.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.400]   I think Julia and I talked about a few other ones, so I would reference that episode.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.080]   But if that doesn't cover it, I will think of other ideas for a future episode and share.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:31.480]   So Yevgeny, hopefully I got that right, asked if I could talk about BlockFi alternatives
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.720]   since they no longer accept signups for the interest account.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.360]   This is a great question and one that I think will change over the next few months.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:44.280]   So ultimately, I think it's a bit strange the way regulators have approached this in
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.640]   preventing BlockFi from operating, not preventing other companies who are offering a
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.160]   similar thing from operating, but saying it's not allowed.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:57.800]   My guess, I don't have any inside knowledge, is that in the coming weeks/months, most of
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.440]   the BlockFi alternatives out there are going to have to go through the same kind of
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.800]   securities registration process BlockFi is.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.880]   And the best alternative will be to sign up for the new version of BlockFi that will be
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.120]   coming out once they finish that process.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:15.640]   Until then, there are sites that offer yield on crypto.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:21.800]   And I think it's a short win to get yield there for now because I think it's going to go
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.640]   away. So for me, for new dollars that I want to earn interest on, I've just kind of been
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.560]   waiting. The interest rates just from the Fed have gone up.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:34.120]   So I know Wealthfront last week raised their cash rate to 0.85%.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.200]   And if you look, there's a really cool site that I'll link in the show notes.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.720]   It's called the Countdown to the FOMC.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:48.720]   It's like this FedWatch tool that shows the odds on what is going to happen at upcoming
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.880]   Fed meetings. So you can kind of get a look at what they think will happen.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:58.160]   So the June 15th meeting, it looks like the expectations are that interest rates, 94% of
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.960]   people are assuming they're going to be in the 1.25% to 1.5% range.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.560]   By July, that goes up to 1.75% to 2%.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.400]   And then by September, it's over 2%.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.960]   So not a perfect alternative.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.720]   But I think sometime over the next few months, also, you're going to see high yield savings
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:21.240]   rates all across the country at various different banks, online banks go up as well.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   So I think that'll be an alternative that will probably cross that 1% mark pretty soon in
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.720]   the future. Okay, Peter, "Any tips for a student who doesn't have established credit?
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.360]   He tried to sign up for the built card to pay rent and the application is pending."
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.760]   I'll give two things.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.760]   One, anytime you sign up for a card, if your application doesn't get approved, I guess
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.160]   if it's in a pending state, I would search.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.920]   I don't know if Built has this, but I know Chase and Amex, they all have reconsideration
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.960]   lines. So if you apply for a card and it doesn't get approved, I would definitely call the
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.160]   reconsideration line.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:58.320]   I know I basically never get approved for any Chase cards anymore because Chase has
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.080]   basically given me all the credit they're willing to give me.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.080]   So I call the reconsideration line.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.200]   And then we go through this process of "Okay, where do I want to move credit?
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.360]   I'm going to take $5,000 of credit from my Chase Freedom Unlimited card, and I'm going
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.720]   to move it to this new card."
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.440]   So I have to call Chase every time.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440]   I never get approved.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.160]   So I wouldn't say not getting approved means you got denied.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.120]   It means you might need to call and understand what they need.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.000]   I also keep my credit frozen.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.280]   And every now and then, I'll apply for a card and forget to unfreeze it, which happened
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.400]   with the VentureX card from Capital One.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.920]   So I called and they said, "We didn't approve you right away because your credit was frozen,
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   so we couldn't do it."
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.120]   So I had to unfreeze it and have them rerun it.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.920]   So I'll flag that if you don't get approved right away, there might be reasons that aren't
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.360]   due to your established credit.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:44.120]   Otherwise, this is not a great answer.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.040]   But if you're new to this, it's finding a card that has lower credit requirements.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.080]   I know the Credit Karma app will actually recommend cards that you can get approved
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.400]   for or even have pre-approval offers.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.080]   I would try to find the best one that falls into that bucket so that you can start building
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.080]   up credit.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.960]   I will say that the mileage may vary on this trick and it requires someone that trusts
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   you.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.680]   But I know that when you become an authorized user on cards, it shows up on your credit
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   report.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.600]   And so if you've ever gone through your credit report, and you and a partner maybe share
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.880]   a card and have one or the other as an authorized user, you'll actually see that card on both
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.240]   credit reports.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.680]   So if you have someone who has a card that they've had for a really long time...
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.800]   I know this worked really well 20 years ago or 30 years ago when my dad added me to his
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.280]   card just to help me build up credit.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.760]   So that's another hack that I would consider trying.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.200]   I would spend some time Googling around to make sure that whatever issuer you're about
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.480]   to do it for does report authorized users.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.000]   And the trick is they don't even have to send you the card.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.400]   They could add you as an authorized user if it's free and not actually give you the card
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.240]   to go spend money on.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.880]   That's one that's worked in the past.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.960]   Otherwise, I would just say get the card you can get, pay it off on time, ask for credit
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.180]   increases at certain intervals so that you can try to establish more credit.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.360]   So Benji, you asked about cashback debit cards.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.000]   I don't have an answer for you right now.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.280]   I understand that if credit is hard to get right now, that a debit card might be a great
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.600]   place to try to earn points because you don't have that alternative.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.960]   I will share 2 thoughts that I have.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.520]   One which is the Extra card, extra.app.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.660]   It's a product that's a debit card that helps you build credit.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.560]   So while you're not going to earn points, if the reason you're using a debit card is
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.880]   because you want to try and build your credit so you can actually get approved for credit
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.760]   cards, check out the Extra card.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.320]   I don't have any affiliation with them.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.780]   I can't endorse them.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:44.080]   But I know that it's a card that helps you build credit with debit.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.880]   Outside of that, I don't know if I have a good example.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:52.920]   I think there are a few like FinTech platforms that offer like 1% cashback on some debit
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.880]   cards, but they usually require a ton of purchases or joining a membership or something like
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.880]   that.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.120]   So I haven't found a good one, but I'm also not looking for one.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.000]   So I don't have a good answer there for anyone.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.680]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.680]   I get it.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.220]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.240]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.320]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.120]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.880]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.680]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.520]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:34.680]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.520]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.080]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.960]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:51.000]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.180]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:58.100]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:03.440]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.240]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:10.280]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.560]   Before we get back to the episode, I just want to thank you for listening to and supporting
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.560]   the show.

[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.360]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.160]   Mallory, I see another question.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.160]   Jump in.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.160]   Yes.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.200]   So this one's more on mindset and personal finance.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:55.040]   So me and my husband, we have limited resources and we've built up a list of about 70, 80
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.920]   goals that we want to financially save for.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:04.600]   And it's been rather difficult to just sit on those goals and not be able to get them
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:10.760]   because there's some that are just like $30 for a lunch or something small like a lunch
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.040]   box or new slippers.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.520]   There's bigger ones that are like the trip to Japan.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:25.560]   And I didn't know if you might have any hacks for ways to think about this sort of thing.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:31.920]   How to approach having so many goals but limited financial resources, that sort of thing.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.240]   My quick reaction to that is that's a lot of goals.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.800]   I struggle to have more than like 3 goals at any given time.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:43.880]   So I would consider maybe could you bucket some of those goals together and say, "We
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:48.960]   have a short-term goal of trying to save X to do these 5 things," and then just focus
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.120]   on the X number instead of the individual ones.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:56.400]   I would also consider trying to just automate the savings away and say, "Okay, I'm just
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.880]   going to put money in these 3 different savings accounts."
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.960]   When I was at Wealthfront, we built this feature called Autopilot.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.240]   So you could literally open up all of these different virtual accounts linked to your
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.320]   cash account and say, "I'm going to put $10 a month in this one until it reaches $1,000.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.120]   I'm going to put $20 a month in this one until it reaches there."
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:16.440]   So just trying to automate it so that you're not trying to think about it every day.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.600]   You might have all of these goals, but if you could not have to think about them every
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.820]   single day, it'd probably be less stressful.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:27.480]   So if you could try to automate the behavior of saving, it might make that a little bit
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   easier.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.280]   If I was achieving them faster, I would say...
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.920]   I have this episode coming up that I haven't recorded yet with a woman named Jen Glantz.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:43.520]   And she had been a bridesmaid for a handful of people and realized that her friends got
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.720]   so much value out of her doing that, that she started a company that at the time was
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.680]   totally different than anyone else out there.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.660]   And she started Bridesmaids for Higher Business, where she posted on Craigslist, "If someone
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:59.080]   needs a bridesmaid to help them get through this craziness, I will help."
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.200]   And she ended up turning that into an entire business.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:07.180]   So the other way I would say, it's hard to cut your spending more and more and more.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:11.120]   It's definitely easier than making more money and that there is a specific way to do it
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.640]   and you could start tomorrow.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.400]   But I would consider if you're trying to achieve goals faster, think about are there skills
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.520]   or hobbies or passions that you have that maybe you've never thought of turning into
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.720]   a side hustle that would be able to help you get there faster.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:32.360]   And I did an episode with Nick Loper from Side Hustle Nation, all about that.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.580]   And I would definitely say check that out.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.800]   And he has a whole podcast all about this.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.120]   And JC, thanks for noticing the new crate and barrel couch back here.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.240]   We got 15% off buying coupons online.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   It's doing great.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:47.140]   Although, if anyone has a hack, I'm going to ask.
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:52.440]   If anyone knows where to buy sofa bed sheets that actually...
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.440]   Maybe it doesn't matter.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.520]   Maybe you just buy the regular size.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:01.500]   But I was blown away that I couldn't find a mattress topper or sheets or basically anything
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:06.060]   the size of a sofa bed mattress, which is like 10 inches shorter than everything else.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.780]   So there's certainly an opportunity out there.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:12.660]   Based on how long it took me to get this couch delivered, there are other people out there
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:13.660]   with sofa beds.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:18.540]   So I highly recommend someone doing that so that one day we can buy a sofa bed sheet set
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.140]   that actually fits the bed.
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:24.540]   So Weber, best card for earning points when shopping on Amazon?
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.260]   I think there are 2 answers there.
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:33.260]   One is there's a 5x on the Freedom Flex and Freedom cards on Amazon right now for this
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   quarter.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.020]   And then there's 2 other approaches.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.420]   Buying Amazon cards at grocery stores is one.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:45.060]   So use a card that earns 4 or 5x points on grocery stores or office supply stores and
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.420]   buying Amazon cards and putting them in.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:52.500]   I will say that I don't actually love that approach for certain types of purchases, primarily
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:57.100]   because I love the purchase protection that a lot of credit cards come with.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.860]   Great example is I bought an iPhone.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:02.180]   I didn't buy this from Amazon, but the same thing would apply.
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:05.900]   And I dropped it like 2 months later and the screen broke.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:10.580]   And I used my Chase purchase protection to go in and get the screen repair paid for.
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:15.260]   So I was able to get a screen repair, which unfortunately now costs 200 and something
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.720]   dollars for free because I bought it on a credit card.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.620]   If you go buy Amazon gift cards and you use them to buy on Amazon, then you don't get
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.780]   that purchase protection from your credit card.
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:30.540]   So I would say I have no problem if you're buying your groceries on Amazon using a gift
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:35.300]   card because you're probably not going to try to do a warranty claim on your groceries.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.100]   But I do think that if you're buying anything that you might want to extend the warranty
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:44.660]   or replace if it's broken, I would definitely try to use a credit card.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.620]   And I actually use the Amazon Chase Visa.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.580]   So someone asked about cashback and I'll hit on that.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.340]   But I'm not typically a fan of cashback.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:59.540]   But the alternative to earning 5% cashback, if the alternative is earning 1x points, I'll
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.040]   just take the 5% cashback from Amazon.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.900]   And so that's what I do on Amazon.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:08.440]   It's the only cashback card I use because there isn't another option.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:13.060]   When there's a quarter and the Chase bonus is 5x points on Amazon, then I'm switching
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.740]   the card for that quarter and I'm using my Chase cards, the Freedom and the Freedom Flex
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.620]   to earn 5x points.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:25.340]   Also, Andrew mentioned that Discover has consistently had 5% back on the last quarter of the year
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:26.500]   at Amazon.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:31.380]   So it actually comes to another question I got about Discover cards.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.820]   And someone said, "You never talked about Discover cards.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.340]   What's the deal?"
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.780]   And honestly, I've never had a Discover card.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.780]   So I don't really have a good answer.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:46.740]   But I often try to prioritize the cards I'm getting with trying to earn the most points
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.740]   I can.
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.260]   And I know Discover just doesn't have a flexible points currency.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.820]   So for me, it's been something that I've never focused on.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.980]   And that question was from Leslie from Massachusetts.
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.460]   So thanks for asking it by email.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:01.580]   It's never been a thing I had.
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:05.220]   So I know that it sounds like from Andrew that they've got good cash back and if cash
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.580]   back is what you're focused on, it could be an option.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:10.020]   And I just haven't spent a lot of time focused on that.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.180]   So sorry, I don't have a better answer.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:15.660]   Actually, it looks like Emmanuel from Card Pointers has something to add.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.660]   So let's jump to him.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.740]   Can I throw in one thing about Discover real quick?
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:26.060]   So as much as it doesn't have a transferable currency, Discover, you can redeem the cash
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.420]   back that you earn for some gift cards.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:29.980]   And they change that.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:34.900]   But oftentimes, there are bonuses, like you can get a Nike gift card and get 20% or 40%
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.020]   more value.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:40.020]   So in fact, it's like you're earning 1.2, 1.4X.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.380]   And Discover has a rotating category that gives you 5X, which is really good.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:48.020]   Sometimes, I don't know if they still do, but they have a double your cash back in the
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.020]   first year.
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:52.380]   I think that was about 1.5% to get 3% cash back.
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.900]   So it can be an interesting one.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.020]   And that's actually my oldest credit card is a Discover card.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.260]   So I've had that one forever.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.260]   Awesome.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.260]   Thank you.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:04.180]   And to the question earlier about building credit, the reason I'm sure Emmanuel is not
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:06.860]   canceling that card ever is because it's one of his oldest cards.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.340]   So friendly reminder that if you have an old card that you opened up to start building
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:16.500]   credit, if you can get a no-fee version of it, which you can often do by asking to downgrade
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:20.620]   or maybe it is a no-fee card, I would try to make sure you put a purchase or two a year
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.900]   on it just to keep it open to help keeping your credit high.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:27.780]   Another asked, "What are some good free cards that have good benefits like extended warranty?"
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.860]   And that's a question I'm going to punt on because I want to do a whole episode about
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:36.060]   card benefits to address everything from purchase protection to extended warranties, travel
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:39.780]   coverage, things like trip cancellation, rental car, and more.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.420]   So stay tuned for that one.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:46.340]   Marlon just asked -- he's about to go remodel something and wants to pay cash.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.620]   Any good ideas for a remodel card?
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:53.460]   I have a hard stop today at 1.30 because we're in the middle of a remodel and I asked if
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:58.900]   I could have a break from the demolition from 12 to 1.30 so that I could record this.
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.580]   And there is not a good answer.
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.340]   I don't think this will work for remodeling.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:07.140]   But I have found that if you ask services that maybe ask you to not pay with cards to
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:11.020]   pay cards, maybe one in three or one in four times, there's an option.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:17.940]   So I ran a little promotional thing for all the hacks in a podcast app called CastBox.
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.940]   And I just asked them.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.060]   They said, "Hey, here's the invoice.
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.060]   Pay with check or ACH."
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.780]   And I was like, "Okay, can I pay with a credit card?"
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.780]   And they're like, "Sure."
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.100]   But they didn't mention it out in the outset.
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:31.460]   So it's always worth asking just to find out if there's an option.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:36.620]   If not, I would say I don't have a good answer other than if there are things that you can
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:37.620]   buy.
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:42.580]   So just because the contractor might not take card doesn't mean you can't pay for a lot
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:43.620]   of the stuff.
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:47.500]   So the plumbing fixtures, the vanity, you could ask if there's any stuff you can pay
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.940]   for directly instead of them.
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:53.580]   And if you have to buy that from a plumbing store or anything like that, you could certainly
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.580]   put that with your cards as well.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.220]   So definitely worth doing that.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:01.380]   So Emmanuel shared a hack of people buying $500 gift cards and paying with those.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.820]   You could certainly say, "Hey, could I pay you in Amex gift cards or gift cards that
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:06.820]   you get at the store?"
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.900]   Or even ask, "Is there a gift card that you're particularly interested in?"
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.620]   That might have a similar effect to paying cash to the contractor in that this is not
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.940]   advice, but it was something told to me when we were Airbnb in our place, someone from
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:24.240]   Germany said, "When you pay cash, it's often tax neutral."
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:30.420]   And so what I would say is if someone really wants to get paid cash, and you could say,
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.380]   "Look, I can't pay cash, but I could pay you in gift cards.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.440]   Pick any type of gift card and I'm happy to do that."
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:40.100]   Maybe you could find a negotiating point there where it feels like cash to the person you're
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:44.340]   paying if it's a small project, but you're able to put those cards on your credit card.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.580]   I think that's everything.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.300]   Thank you so much for everyone being here.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.340]   I'm going to talk a little bit about this giveaway.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.580]   I'll mention it in the episode also.
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:56.500]   But I've got three things to be thankful for this giveaway.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:00.900]   One, early on, I used my referral link and some people signed up for the VentureX card.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:05.500]   So I'm going to give away 10,000 of those Capital One points to people listening right
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.420]   now and in the future.
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:14.580]   I'm going to thankfully be able to, from a manual support, give away a lifetime membership
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:20.300]   to Card Pointers Pro, which is just really generous and I appreciate him doing that.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.580]   It's a great app.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:24.860]   If you aren't the one who wins it, I still think you should check it out.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:28.500]   There's a trial if you want to check it out and see how it works.
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:34.700]   And if you go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers, you can actually also get what I think is
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:38.980]   the biggest discount there's ever been to get 20% off Pro, whether you want to do it
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:41.420]   monthly or a lifetime membership.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:43.220]   So there's that.
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:46.020]   And then another really big thank you to Viori.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.620]   I literally wear Viori every day.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.500]   This is not like the sponsors paid me.
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:52.900]   In fact, all the Viori clothes I have, I actually paid for myself.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:57.020]   But I reached out to them and said, "Hey, we're doing this live episode."
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:00.540]   And they offered to give $100 gift card to Viori to someone.
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.380]   So huge thanks to them.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:07.340]   If you haven't checked out their clothes and you don't win allthehacks.com/viori, which
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:11.660]   is not spelled like it's pronounced, it's V-U-O-R-I.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:16.260]   So allthehacks.com/viori, V-U-O-R-I.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.940]   And I think they're literally the most comfortable clothes.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.740]   I just wear black t-shirts and gray t-shirts that happen to be there.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:26.540]   So it's probably not obvious to you that they're comfortable, nor are the joggers I'm always
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.540]   wearing.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.780]   But definitely check them out.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:33.580]   And thank you so much to Viori for offering that this episode.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   I think that's all.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:39.140]   The way I'm going to do the giveaway, if you go to allthehacks.com/giveaway, there's a
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.860]   quick form, it's four questions.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.700]   It's "Which things do you want to enter in?"
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:48.220]   The Card Pointers Pro membership, the Viori gift card, and the 10,000 Capital One miles.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:52.100]   The reason I had it set up like that is because Capital One will let you transfer miles to
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.860]   people but only people who have a Capital One account.
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:58.420]   So for the sake of the people who do, I want to make sure that whoever wins can actually
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.420]   use them.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.300]   And many of you probably already have a Card Pointers Pro membership.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.220]   So maybe that's not the right one.
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.420]   I need your email.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.740]   And then I'm actually doing something different.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:12.700]   I'm going to do a drawing and the drawing is going to pull from everyone, but you're
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.700]   going to get multiple entries for different things.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.700]   So if you subscribe to the newsletter, if you subscribe to the podcast, if you follow
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:26.180]   me on Twitter or Instagram, if you write a review for the show on Apple Podcasts, and
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:30.340]   if you attended this, each one of those is going to count for an entry.
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.100]   And then I just have like a fun "Please certify that you actually did these things."
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.580]   I might check before we give things away, but it helps me grow the show and I really
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:39.580]   appreciate it.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:43.340]   The one last thing I want to share is that there is an awesome deal happening right now.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.340]   This week is Rakuten's Big Give Week and it ends May 16th.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.340]   So why do you care?
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:53.380]   Well, first off, if you don't have an account already, you get $40 for free in your account
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:56.660]   after you join from a referral and spend $40.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:02.260]   So if you want to use mine, it's allthehacks.com/rakuten or click the link in the show notes.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:08.060]   But more importantly, they are offering 15% cash back at hundreds of merchants.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:14.940]   From Ace Hardware, to Under Armour, to Walgreens, to Dick's Sporting Goods, and so many more.
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:19.860]   And best of all, you can choose to earn Amex points instead of cash back, which I think
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.420]   makes this deal twice as valuable.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.820]   So definitely check it out.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.660]   All right, that's it for this live episode of All The Hacks.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:31.620]   I would love to hear what you thought, so please shoot me a DM or email and share.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:36.140]   Again, thank you so much for all your support over the past year.
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:40.300]   Please don't forget to enter the giveaway for a chance to win $10,000 Capital One Miles,
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:45.160]   a $100 Viore gift card, or a free lifetime membership to Card Pointers.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.200]   And I'll see you next week.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.860]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:51.860]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:56.700]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.060]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:02.100]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:06.700]   I'm Chris@AllTheHacks.com or @Hutchins on Twitter.
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:07.700]   That's it for this week.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.320]   I'll see you next week.
