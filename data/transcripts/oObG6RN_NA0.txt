[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   [music]
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.040]   In episode 123, you explained how food is made holy by the Word and prayer.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.240]   And as a follow-up question, Pastor John, should we pray before meals?
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.480]   Why or why not?
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.640]   That question, "Should we pray before we eat?" might be coming from two different mindsets.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.680]   It might come from a convert out of paganism who's never seen anybody in their life pray
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.080]   before they eat.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.120]   And then they see it done the first time at church or visiting a Christian, and they wonder,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.480]   "What is that?"
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.760]   And so the question might be perfectly, wonderfully appropriate and innocent coming from somebody
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.480]   who wants to bring their life into conformity to a biblical way.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:01.240]   However, I just have the sense that this question might come from a 20-something who might have
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.840]   grown up in a home where every meal time was preceded by prayer, and it didn't feel all
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.160]   that authentic to him, and therefore, he's having a hard time making that part of his
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.120]   life, and he wonders whether, "Do we have to do that?"
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:31.720]   So let me just say a few things, and whichever of those applies, I have more the second person
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.160]   in mind because I'm just suspicious that may be where it's coming from.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.560]   So here's my first observation.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.680]   The question may reveal an unwholesome view of duty.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.320]   Here's what I mean.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.080]   Edward John Carnell, who wrote the book Christian Commitment, one of my favorite books, which
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:03.720]   is out of print, in that book writes this, "Suppose a husband asks his wife if he must
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.040]   kiss her goodnight.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.640]   Her answer is, 'You must, but not that kind of must.'"
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.840]   When I read that 30, maybe 40 years ago, I said, "Wow, that is so illuminating."
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.440]   Yes, you must kiss me tonight, goodnight, but no, no, not that kind of must.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   My statement then with regard to eating, I mean, praying before we eat is we should,
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.080]   but not that kind of should.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.200]   In other words, depending on the tone of voice, when you say, "Must we?"
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.840]   What does that mean?
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.000]   What is going on there?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.080]   There are morally, spiritually fitting things to do, and their oughtness rises not from
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.040]   law but love.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.820]   First John 5, 3 says, "This is the love of God that we keep as commandments, and his
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.080]   commandments are not burdensome."
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.600]   In other words, yes, we should keep the commandments, but no, not that way.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.240]   Yes, we should pray, but not that way.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:28.840]   Our aim is to cultivate a heart that feels a duty like being told to, "You must enjoy
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.280]   your hot fudge sundae."
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.240]   Oh, okay, I will try.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.080]   In other words, if you eat a hot fudge sundae because you have to, you don't have to eat
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.120]   this hot fudge sundae, but you really should eat the hot fudge sundae.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.120]   That's number one.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.440]   The question may reveal an unwholesome view of duty.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.720]   Here's a second thing that I'm afraid a lot of people today don't think through.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.360]   Habits of the body nourish habits of the soul as well as vice versa.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   A lot of people think that it is a spiritual and life-giving thing if habits of the soul
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.080]   give spontaneous rise to acts of the body, and that's right.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   They do.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   That's wonderful.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080]   That is life-giving.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   That feels free.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.400]   But in the real world where we live, it works the other way, too, and a lot of people don't
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.880]   think about that.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.800]   Habits of the body, like praying at mealtimes, which sometimes are enlivened by the spontaneous
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.080]   delights of the soul in God and His goodness, and sometimes are at 50 percent and sometimes
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.240]   at 10 percent, and sometimes we're just doing it, that, too, should be preserved for the
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.320]   sake of the soul, for the sake of the spontaneity, for the sake of the joy.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.040]   It's like, I'm wondering if the person could try this, it's like kissing your wife goodbye
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.760]   in the morning and hugging every kid.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.600]   Should you do that?
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.480]   And if someone says, "Well, I should do it when I feel like it, then it'll be authentic."
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.280]   I'm going to say, "No, no, no, no.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.240]   I don't think it works like that.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.080]   I don't think it works like that.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.240]   If I say I will only kiss her and hug them when I'm feeling especially warm, I will destroy
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.520]   a pattern of life that has value not only to express the affection when it's there,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.480]   but to tip me off when it's not there, and to be there when the affection returns, that
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.480]   is, the pattern of life will be there so that the affection can come down like an anointing
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.720]   on it, even sometimes when I'm not expecting it.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:57.300]   So I think in family life especially, and single life is getting ready for family life,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.440]   we should cultivate outward expressions of love that matter when feelings rise, when
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.880]   feelings fall.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:15.300]   We don't need the habit of body at mealtime just because it's always authentic.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.800]   We need it to be there so that when the authenticity comes, there'll be something to feel.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.500]   Here's a third observation.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.040]   Giving thanks at mealtime is a wonderful, well-timed opportunity to obey the command
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.360]   to give thanks.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.120]   The Bible says, Ephesians 5, "Give thanks always and for everything to God, and what
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.840]   better time to build obedience into our lives than at a very moment when God is freely giving
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.080]   us something we need for our very lives."
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.240]   It's also one of the clearest ways of teaching children massively important truth about where
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.680]   everything comes from.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.780]   Children, especially little children, they're not reading your heart every time.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.360]   They're reading your body, your faithfulness, your commitment, your steadiness, and it's
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.720]   a wonderful time to be teaching them simple prayers about how to be thankful to God.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.520]   I think the last thing I'd say, Tony, is why would you not want to?
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.040]   Why would that not be the question?
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:34.120]   What would be the new, compelling, modern arguments against a tradition that has gone
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:43.480]   back 2,000, probably 4,000 years, and is practiced by Christians in every culture on the planet?
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.760]   What would be the new discoveries people are making today that would say, "Oh, I see.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.720]   We can have a better view of this than has been had all these years."
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.060]   So it is a beautiful Christian tradition.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.360]   Why would we not want to do it?
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   Right.
