[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   [Music]
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.240]   All right, so we have a big question here from EA.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.640]   EA asks, "Is Cal Newport's outlook on the future too positive?
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.640]   Cal often compares social media and digital technology addiction to cigarettes,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.480]   claiming that it will probably end up with bans and less tolerance as happened with cigarettes.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.920]   It seems to me that everything is pointing towards the opposite.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.440]   Here are six examples that EA gives.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.560]   One, it is almost impossible to go to a restaurant and not see kids on a phone.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.880]   Two, schools are becoming lax in their rules.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.920]   Three, proving that cigarettes are harmful is way easier than proving that social media is harmful.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.360]   Four, this troubling rush for remote work indicates that people want more digital interactions, not less.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.480]   Five, I contend that cigarettes actually prove that people want more addiction as long as it's less visible.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.080]   And six, something could also be said about energy drinks.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.240]   I'm not sure if I get point six.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   So here's what I'd say, EA.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.240]   You might not be correctly portraying my views on this.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.520]   So here are the two claims I actually make, which are similar, but I think they've become
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.760]   twisted a little bit in the way that you're talking about them.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.560]   So one, when it comes to cigarettes and social media use, the claim I've made is that
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.920]   teenage social media use will be seen in the future like we now see teenage smoking.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.000]   So we realized teenagers are particularly vulnerable to the
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.440]   addictive properties of nicotine, so we should find it to be inappropriate
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.880]   for a 16-year-old or a 14-year-old to be smoking cigarettes.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.720]   Cigarette companies should not advertise towards them.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   The culture shifted on that.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.800]   And obviously, some teenagers still smoke.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's not like it once was, where like, look, this is if you're cool is what you're doing,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760]   and it was much more prevalent.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.280]   So I've made that argument, not that digital use in general, culture-wide, population-wide,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.440]   is going to go the way of cigarettes, where cigarette usage, after staying stable at about
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.160]   30% for a long time, has in more recent years been falling.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:24.080]   Two, I've been arguing that the age of having a small number of social media platform
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.800]   monopolies that everyone feels cultural pressure to use, universal social media tools, like we were
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600]   five years ago with Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, that that age is going to go away.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.280]   And that the tools we use to communicate and to be entertained is going to fragment
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.680]   and become more bespoke.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.560]   And so you might be using TikTok, and I might be listening to this podcast, and you might be into
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.000]   this streaming service, and I use that streaming service, and you might be on this social network,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.560]   a platform that's specifically aimed at athletes, and it's going to become much more fragmented and
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.040]   bespoke.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.120]   This age of, if you're not on this one or two platforms, it's weird that we look at you with
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.920]   concern in our eyes, that you get the same type of blowback I used to get in 2014 or 2015 or 2016
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   when I said, I don't use social media, that type of pearl-clutching gasping, what do you mean?
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   That's all going to go away for a lot of reasons I've talked about before.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.760]   However, none of this claims that people aren't going to be very distracted looking at screens
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.240]   all the time.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.720]   I don't know if that's going to change broadly anytime soon.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.840]   I just think we're not going to have 14-year-olds with unrestricted social media access.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.880]   I just think that we're not going to have two companies that everyone has to use their service.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.720]   And I think that's good, and I think that is optimistic, but I do not have a view that is
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.160]   so optimistic that it says, oh, we're not going to be distracted by the digital in the future.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.080]   I don't think that's going to be the case.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.800]   I think if anything, it might become more distracting, and we have to talk about the
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.760]   metaverse and augmented reality and virtual reality, and it's a whole complicated picture
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.160]   that I can't see clearly through.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.960]   So I think I'm a lot more narrow in what I claim EA.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.680]   So for better or for worse, my optimism is more focused than the brand of optimism that
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.960]   you're pushing back against here.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.400]   I will say one thing, though.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.640]   Your point number three, proving that cigarettes are harmful is way easier than proving that
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.920]   social media is harmful.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.960]   I'm not sure that's true.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.480]   And I'll just point you towards a New Yorker piece I wrote in the fall, last fall.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.160]   I wrote a New Yorker piece that asked the question, should teenagers be using social
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.880]   media?
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:46.000]   And one of the points I made in there is we often forget how long it took to convince
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.360]   ourselves that smoking was harmful.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.320]   And I went back and I found the original articles.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.520]   I mean, I have scientific articles from early 20th century where people are saying there
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.360]   might be a lung cancer thing going on here.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.320]   And there was a lot of pushback about it.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.160]   When did we get to the point where we had a sort of consistent message from, let's say,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.480]   the surgeon general that smoking caused lung cancer?
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.760]   You had to get to the '50s or '60s.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.880]   I mean, it took decades.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.360]   And I talked about it in that article.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.200]   So I was looking at the research and I was talking to experts about the social psych
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.840]   research on social media use among adolescents and harmful outcomes.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.760]   And I was saying, yeah, it's a messy literature.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.120]   These literatures are messy.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.360]   And even when it says clear cut as smoking and lung cancer, it wasn't clear cut.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.920]   And it took decades to really be confident about it.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.440]   So my point there was don't expect the quote unquote "science" to come in and have a
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.400]   clear answer.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.080]   We couldn't do it for smoking.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.400]   It's going to take a long time to get an answer like that for social media.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.040]   So we have to move beyond the science and depend more on our own experience, the testimony
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.680]   of the people using these tools, our own instincts as parents and educators that this is a cultural
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.080]   problem, not one that we can look to the science to solve.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.160]   So, you know, it's interesting aside, it took a long time to figure out that smoking
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.840]   really was harmful.
