[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Hey Radicals, this is Joshua Sheets today. I have a quick announcement for you that consulting calls are back open and available to you during the month of April and at a reduced price.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   If you would like to book a personal consultation with me, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It also works if you go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   You can book a call with me there now.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   These are available during the month of April at a reduced price, 20% discount off of the normal rate.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   So if you would like to speak to me about your personal situation, you'd like to talk about your personal financial plan,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   you'd like an independent certified financial planner's review of your situation,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   you can schedule a call with me during the month of April at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   This time I have opened up a total of 100 call slots available and I've dedicated the month of April to this work.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   So last time I opened up 50 and I sold out of the consulting appointments in about a week and a half.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   So I would estimate that there should be some there for you at least for the next couple of weeks because this time I've opened up 100 slots.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So if you'd like to talk to me about anything relating to your personal financial planning,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   anything relating to your retirement planning, your finances, budget planning, I've done quite a lot of business consulting in these calls.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I do quite a lot of tax consulting, do quite a lot of internationalization consulting.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   All of these are available to you at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult at a reduced rate here during the month of April.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   These calls have not been available over the last few months.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It really works best for me to bunch these calls together so I like to bunch them into a few weeks at a time.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I guess it's turned out that I've come up with kind of a spring consulting season and sort of an autumn/fall consulting season as well.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   This works well, well has worked well because recently we've been in baby mode and that's of course taken up a huge amount of my time
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and then we'll have a travel season here this summer.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So this is your time if you'd like to talk to me personally.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   If you've ever thought about working with me but you're not sure if I can bring you a value first,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I would just refer you to the archives of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   There are thousands of hours of me sharing with you my ideas, me answering questions specifically.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Feel free to listen to the Friday Q&A shows and you can hear how I handle inquiries, how I think about things.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   The big reason to speak with me on a one-on-one call is a few things.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Number one, you get privacy so of course one-on-one calls offer you the chance to share more personal details with me
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   which can help me to provide more accurate information.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Usually on a Friday call I won't get into too deep of the details.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I'll kind of just riff on your generalized question and then you can go back.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But on a personal one-on-one call I can work with you very, very directly, very, very closely.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And so I'm happy to serve you on a very personalized basis on a one-on-one call.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   The way I use the time on a one-on-one call is extremely efficient.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I encourage all of my clients to send me a written summary of their situation in advance of the call.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I review that summary so I come to the call ready to go, prepared with ideas, prepared with thoughts and frameworks, etc. that can help you.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And so personalized attention, extended amount of time with me and I've got a pretty high rate of success.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I can only think of one time where I know specifically a client has been upset
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   but I have a vague impression that it's been at least one more time than that.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Although I can't remember the specifics of the second situation, I remember the specifics of the first.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So I've got out of hundreds and hundreds of, I don't know the number, but hundreds and hundreds of consulting calls
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I've had two unhappy clients.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So pretty good average satisfaction rate.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I've got lots of testimonials from listeners and customers who've called with me.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I've lots and lots of repeat clients.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Every time I open up one of these sessions, I have about 15 to 20 customers who just immediately book several calls with me
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   because we've had such good interaction over the years.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   If you're looking to work with a financial planner on just a completely unbiased perspective, it doesn't get any better than this.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I don't sell any products. I don't sell anything other than just simply my advice and expertise.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And so if that sounds good to you, if you'd like to brainstorm ways to progress in your career,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   how to 10x your income, if you'd like to brainstorm ways to speed up the results,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   if you'd like to analyze your business, if you'd like to look through your financial planning
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   and do kind of a checkup with an independent financial planner.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   By the way, that is a big service.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I have lots of DIY customers, people who do all their own financial planning,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   but they'd like to talk with a professional and just make sure they're not missing anything.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And so I think this is a great service as well.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Sometimes clients use me to kind of check some of their other advisors out, make sure everything's going well.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And so these are all services that are available for you.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   If you'd like to speak to me, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult, radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult and book a call now.
