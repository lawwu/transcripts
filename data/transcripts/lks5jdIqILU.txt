[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What about rewarding kids?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   And here, rather than start off by asking,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.720]   you know, what are the best ways
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.140]   to reward kids in healthy ways?
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.880]   I will ask that in a moment.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.020]   How can we evaluate the notion of rewards or incentives
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.880]   through this lens of sturdiness, boundaries, and empathy?
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.080]   - Yeah.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.760]   Because, you know, I could imagine, you know,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.320]   a reward that's outsized in comparison to what a kid did.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.360]   You know, okay, great, you know,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.320]   you took your plate to the kitchen sink after dinner.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.200]   You know, you get $10,000, obviously out of scale,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.920]   extreme example, but just by way of example.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.040]   You know, screw up their reward mechanisms for life,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.440]   if you ask me, everything I know about reward
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.960]   and neuroplasticity says that that would occur.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.720]   But this idea that, you know, you can incentivize kids.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.440]   If you turn off the TV now,
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.880]   then you definitely can watch tomorrow night.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.400]   Whereas if you don't, you can't.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.560]   So you're sort of merging reward and potential punishment.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.440]   You know, how do we bound rewards?
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.640]   And how do we take into account
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.040]   that when we start adding rewards to scenarios
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.160]   that we're mixing and matching life experience for them?
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.520]   You know, okay, so now doing what I'm told,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.860]   do I always expect a reward?
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.880]   If the reward doesn't come next time,
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.600]   we know based on reward prediction error,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   we tend to be worse off emotionally
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.880]   than had we never received a reward in the first place.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.920]   Again, pretty vast parameter space,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.000]   but what are your thoughts on best ways to reward kids
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.480]   for standard good behavior versus achievement,
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.760]   versus elimination of bad behavior?
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.600]   - Yeah. - Maybe.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.720]   So three categories.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.840]   - I think you're asking a much bigger question,
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.640]   or I'm gonna, I think you are,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   which is like, why do parents think we need to reward kids?
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   I think that's, why do we think we need to punish kids?
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.200]   And this is actually where everything I work on started from
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.640]   because the way I was trained to work with parents,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.600]   I went to, you know,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.200]   the best gold standard evidence-based program.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.560]   And it was all about timeouts and punishments
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.320]   and rewards and stickers and ignoring and praise.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.960]   And honestly, during the training,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.560]   for the years after I kind of practiced this way,
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.600]   I feel like that, you know this better than I am,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.520]   so I shouldn't even say this,
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920]   but like that left part of my brain,
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.560]   like logic and linearity.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.800]   I was just like, this is amazing.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.760]   Oh my goodness, we're gonna get more of the good behavior
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.880]   and we're gonna not get the bad behavior.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.600]   And I'd start teaching this to parents in my private practice
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.560]   and there was this little thing in me,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.440]   I don't even know, I was like, I don't know about this.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.280]   I don't know.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.200]   And it got louder and louder to the point that in a session,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.880]   I literally said to a parent in front of me,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.800]   I was just like telling them how to do a timeout.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.640]   I said, I'm sorry,
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.600]   I don't believe anything I've been telling you.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.680]   That's literally what I said.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.080]   'Cause I just, it was so loud
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.880]   and it was obviously super awkward,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.560]   but it led me to, I feel like from this first principles way
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.240]   be like, there are a million assumptions that we have
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.560]   about raising kids and I think about relationships.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.680]   And if I just strip them back, what do I be left with?
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800]   And what would it be a new building from there?
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.520]   And rewards and like punishments to me are these assumptions
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.440]   that we have somehow converted from like
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.040]   the fiction shelf of the library in my mind
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.120]   to like the nonfiction shelf as like truths.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.080]   And I kind of rail against all of them.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.440]   So I think the question,
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.200]   if that's okay to go in that direction to me is like,
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   why do we think we need to reward kids?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.080]   And is there actually a better system,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.960]   both short-term and long-term?
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.720]   I'm incredibly long-term greedy in my parenting approach.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.400]   'Cause at the end of the day,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.800]   18 and up is where things really matter.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.240]   Not really matter, I mean, they all matter,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.360]   but I'd rather, I wanna help my kids
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.560]   become sturdy, resilient adults.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.200]   But I'm short-term greedy too 'cause I'm a realist.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.520]   Like I just can't deal with like
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.240]   all of these difficult moments.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.040]   You get both for sure without rewards and punishments.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.560]   So I don't know, what might someone tell me
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.800]   they give a reward for?
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.680]   Do you wanna use the like clearing the table or example?
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.840]   Let's start that there.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.800]   It kind of goes back to like
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.040]   believing kids are inherently good inside.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.320]   I really think it goes back to that.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.280]   If you really believe kids are inherently good inside,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.240]   which by the way, when I strip back every assumption,
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.080]   the only thing I was left was that.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.440]   Literally the only thing.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.040]   And then I started to think, okay,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.960]   so if they're good inside,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.680]   why do they do so many annoying things like all the time?
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680]   But that gave me a gap.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.440]   And I feel like that is very exciting to have a gap.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.920]   Like why do people who are good inside
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.360]   do such bad things, right?
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.080]   Adults or kids.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.000]   And to me, right, kids are born with all the feelings
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.840]   and none of the skills to manage those feelings.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.680]   Like period.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.360]   And we've often thought, therefore, when feelings,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.800]   feelings without skills come out in behaviors.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.680]   I think that's what bad behaviors are.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.920]   Feelings or urges or something without a skill
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.400]   to manage them or without access to the skill,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.320]   maybe in that moment, either way.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.640]   And then we end up punishing behavior,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.880]   but the behavior was just a sign of the lack of skill.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.080]   So I can't imagine anyone thinking
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.480]   I could teach my kid to swim
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.520]   by punishing them for not swimming.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.840]   Like, I think someone would say that was crazy.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.360]   And, but that's kind of how we raise kids.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.360]   And then we think rewarding them is gonna be effective,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.360]   but it actually leads over and over to what you said.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.320]   I've seen these parents over and over my private practice.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.360]   My 14 year old literally won't pick up their clothes
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.160]   from the floor unless I give them $5.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.080]   Like, how did I get here?
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.660]   And I'm like, yeah, that's a problem,
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.240]   but I saw how they got there.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.240]   So let's take clearing, you know, their plate.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.760]   Like, I know this is gonna sound cheesy,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.420]   but kids do have something in them
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.000]   where they wanna feel like a purposeful,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.800]   meaningful part of society.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.640]   They do.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.160]   Impact drives adults and it drives kids.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.480]   It's not the same type of rewarding as playing Fortnite.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.360]   It's a totally different system.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.460]   But I think the question is like,
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.160]   why do we think we have to bribe kids
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.960]   or, you know, kind of trick them into doing things
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.440]   that are kind of like basic parts of human life?
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.280]   And so if we take that,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.000]   and my kid chronically isn't clearing their plate,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.400]   I could say to them, look,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.600]   every time you clear a plate, I'm gonna give you a sticker.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   After five stickers, you're gonna get,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.680]   I don't know, whatever it is.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.920]   To me, like a much more just effective way
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.480]   is I'd say to my kid, hey, I know you know,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.240]   like clearing a plate is just one way
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.080]   of being part of this family and taking care of stuff.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.960]   I know you know that, we're on the same team.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.560]   I say that phrase, we're on the same team, right?
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.120]   We are.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.040]   Something's getting in your way of remembering.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.440]   I'm gonna assume, I like the most generous interpretation.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.640]   That to me allows you to separate someone's bad behavior
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.120]   from their good identity.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.680]   Then I'm gonna say, what would help you remember?
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.760]   We literally did this with my son
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.640]   who always had his towel on the floor.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.640]   And I was just like, I bet he just doesn't remember.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.720]   He literally doesn't see it.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.440]   And we talked about it and he's like,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.720]   we talked about him putting a Post-it, literally,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.960]   something simple like a Post-it on my door
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.280]   that just says, pick up my towel.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.920]   He wrote it in his own handwriting, right?
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.720]   Trying to facilitate him like solving his own problems.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.160]   And now he has a much higher rate of picking up his towel.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.400]   Like, I guess I could have said,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.600]   every time you pick up your towel, you'll, I don't know,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.760]   get a dollar or whatever it is.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.000]   But again, it makes me think,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.320]   I'm not building the generalizable skill that way.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.920]   I'm just kind of offering something at the end,
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.760]   which sets me on this kind of awful cycle
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.360]   that I think kind of misses the point.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.720]   I love the idea that kids want purpose.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.400]   - And am I correct in wondering
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.920]   if that goes back to this, am I real component
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.560]   of the, am I real, am I safe?
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.400]   - Yes.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.840]   - Like one way that we know we are real
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.800]   is our ability to impart change on the world around us.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.160]   I don't want to get too abstract here,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.880]   but as a neuroscientist,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.080]   I've often sat back and reflected
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.240]   like all the emotions we feel,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.440]   like no one sees that or knows that.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.880]   Unless we say something, we write something,
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.600]   we sing something, we shout something,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.920]   all the forms of expression,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.600]   just like none of our dreams,
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   our creative insights or wishes exist except inside us,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.360]   unless we transmute them into something in the real world.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.400]   So there does seem to be something
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.080]   about having this nervous system
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   from a time we're really young,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.840]   like it's seeing our effect on the world
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.960]   that really makes us real and on others.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.480]   And I love the idea that, well,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.120]   and I must say, I absolutely believe in my heart
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.080]   and I just feel it as a feeling
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.400]   that kids are inherently good inside.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   Like, I just, I can't imagine any other version of that,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   but does that mean that there are people out there
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.440]   who believe that kids are inherently bad
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.520]   or at least not good?
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.120]   I mean, like, how could that be?
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.040]   But then again, maybe I'm just naive.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.840]   - I don't know if anyone consciously believes that,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.040]   but when I go back to that system
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.760]   I was first trained in, rewards and punishments,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.640]   like it feels like a system of behavioral control.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.720]   And to me, like I've always thought about control
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.680]   and trust as opposites.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.600]   So I only control what I don't trust.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.560]   So nobody said to me in that program,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.240]   by the way, Becky, everything you're learning here,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.680]   we believe kids are bad inside.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.520]   And so we do this thing,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.560]   but well, if I don't trust my kid
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.400]   and if I don't trust they inherently have the things
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.880]   in them to do good, by the way,
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.200]   that's not gonna happen naturally.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.960]   That's why we have a big job as a parent to coach our kids,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.640]   to bring that out, to set boundaries when they can't do it
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.800]   and so many other things.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.160]   But I don't believe anyone would say,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.360]   yeah, it's 'cause they're bad inside.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.480]   But there is a nature where you're constantly interacting
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.040]   with your kid from that other system,
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.000]   looking at them like, I don't trust you.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.840]   I don't trust you.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.400]   And when you do bad things,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.000]   I cannot hold on to the fact that you have a good identity.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.080]   That's why I'm giving you a punishment.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.960]   That's why I'm sending you away to your room.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.240]   And so if I'm reflecting back to you constantly,
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.120]   that you are just your latest behavior,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.400]   that I don't trust you,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.200]   that I kind of have to bribe you
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.920]   to do very basic human things.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.080]   Well, our kids form their identity
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.720]   from our reflection of them.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.920]   And so then this is what really compelled all of this.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.880]   I'm like, we're raising generation after generation of kid,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.760]   kind of saying to them,
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.760]   like, you're kind of a bad, untrustworthy kid.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.680]   And then we wonder why we have such high rates
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.120]   of like massive mental health problems.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.920]   Well, like, there's some linearity there.
