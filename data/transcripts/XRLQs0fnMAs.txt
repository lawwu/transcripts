[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - Today we have an incredibly thoughtful
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.720]   and detailed question from a concerned dad.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.480]   It's anonymous.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.200]   Pastor John, my 14 year old daughter
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.900]   read through the book of Job for the first time this year
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.760]   and is really struggling with how God
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.320]   is portrayed in that book.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.440]   She has heard all of her life that God is loving and just
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   and cannot understand why God would allow Job
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960]   and his children, wife and servants
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.360]   to suffer such devastation.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.080]   She's deeply disturbed by the fact that God pointed Job
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.600]   out to Satan intentionally,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.320]   thus drawing his attention to this righteous man,
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520]   allowing Satan to take away nearly everything Job had.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.900]   And for what purpose?
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.600]   Merely to prove a point to Satan and to the host of heaven
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.920]   that Job's reverence for God was unshakable.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.580]   How would you explain to a girl
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.440]   who understands the gospel intellectually,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.120]   but who may not have had it applied to her heart yet?
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120]   To her, it seems that God was arbitrary and almost cruel
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.020]   to allow Job and everyone around him to suffer,
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.600]   to prove a point or to perfect a man
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.720]   who was already more righteous than most of us.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.920]   She wonders about the collateral damage to Job's wife,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.120]   including her faith, who suffered the loss
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.680]   of everything Job did with the exception
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320]   of her personal health.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.040]   It does not bring her much comfort to think
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.880]   that following God can result in such devastation.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.520]   I've talked with her about the fact that death
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.680]   and suffering is part of our human existence
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.040]   since the fall and is a direct and indirect result of sin.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.280]   We've talked about the fact that it was Satan's cruelty
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.600]   that was the actual instrument of suffering,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.760]   although within the sovereign will of God,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.640]   and that this life and its suffering here on this earth
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.520]   is nothing compared to glory in eternity.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.760]   We've also talked about how God himself has suffered
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.200]   on our behalf and bore our sins on the cross,
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   and that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800]   although our sins grieve him.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.320]   Pastor John, what else would you say?
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.800]   Well, I certainly want to commend this dad
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   for the kinds of things he has patiently shown his daughter.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.560]   That's an amazing list of insights
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.480]   that he has shared with her.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.040]   If he hadn't asked me, "What else would you say?"
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.600]   I would have said what he said.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.720]   Those are all solid biblical truths
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.680]   that he highlighted there at the end of his question.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.960]   So what else?
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.840]   That's what he's asking.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.920]   What else would I say?
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.800]   And keep in mind that if I knew her,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.440]   I would try to take into account how to say them,
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.440]   but I don't, and so I'll do the best I can.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.960]   First, I would try to help her see
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.840]   what only a divine miracle can make her see,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.840]   namely, that the value of God and his glory
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.240]   is infinitely greater than the value of all human beings
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.760]   who have or ever will exist.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.600]   Until a person believes this and feels this,
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.080]   the superior value of God himself,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.200]   much of the Bible will make no sense, including Job.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm thinking, for example,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.800]   when I say this principle of the ultimate value of God,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   I'm thinking of words like Isaiah 40, 15 to 17.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.760]   "Behold," God says,
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.400]   "the nations are like a drop from a bucket
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.240]   "and are counted as the dust on the scales.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   "All the nations are as nothing before him.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.240]   "They are accounted by him as less than emptiness."
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.160]   Now, stressing this infinite difference
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.440]   between the worth of God and the worth of all other reality
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.680]   is not contrary to the love of God.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.480]   It is what makes the love of God amazing.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.520]   If you try to enhance the love of God
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.380]   by reducing the distance between his value and ours,
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.840]   you wind up replacing reality with imagination
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.460]   and destroying grace.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.800]   Second, this means that when we make judgments
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.640]   in this world about good and bad, right and wrong,
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.280]   beautiful and ugly, just and unjust,
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.000]   we should never, this is what I would try to help her see,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.000]   we should never start with our own sense of the good
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.120]   and right and beautiful and just
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.080]   and then use them to judge the acts of God.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.560]   Rather, we should start with the acts of God
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.560]   revealed in the Bible and think our way out from there
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.320]   to what is truly good and right and beautiful and just.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.280]   I remember the years 1979 and 1980,
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.480]   I wrestled for months with the logic
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.600]   of Romans 9, 14 and 15, which goes like this.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.440]   What should we say then?
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.280]   Is there injustice on God's part?
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.820]   By no means, for he says to Moses,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.960]   "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.400]   and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.440]   And I just sat staring at that for months saying,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.040]   "How does that work?
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.120]   How does that logic work?"
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.220]   I wrestled month after month with biblical logic saying,
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.000]   "I gotta get my head fixed.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.520]   I'm not gonna fix this text.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.120]   This text is God's word.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.240]   My head is the problem, not this text."
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.080]   And the second book I ever wrote
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.400]   called "The Justification of God"
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.120]   was my answer to that one question.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.480]   200 pages to answer that question.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.560]   And it was driven home to me.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.580]   You will never grasp the truth of God.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.820]   You will never understand the Bible, John Piper,
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.960]   if you start with yourself and judge God
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.040]   instead of starting with God and judge yourself.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.080]   Third, hand in hand with this biblical God-centered approach
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.640]   to reality goes the heartfelt conviction
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.120]   that human sinfulness, my sinfulness in particular,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.120]   makes us all liable to God's just judgment.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.200]   Or as Paul says, makes us all, quote,
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.680]   "Children of wrath," Ephesians 2.3.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.980]   In other words, every breath
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.460]   that every human takes is undeserved.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.840]   It is another moment, another gift of grace
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   and no suffering that any human receives from God
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.800]   in this life is more than what we deserve ever.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:12.200]   Therefore, no injustice from God
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.140]   is ever done to any human.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.100]   On the earth, everyone is treated by God
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.960]   better than we deserve, everyone.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.920]   On the horizontal plane, in relations between humans,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.240]   there are horrific injustices,
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.820]   which God hates because God hates sin.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.240]   But we have not yet fathomed the greatness
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.860]   of our offense against God if we think
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.860]   that any suffering from his hand, from his hand,
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.240]   is undeserved.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.800]   This is why God was perfectly right and just
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   to drown every single human being on the planet,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.820]   old and young, except for eight people
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.280]   in the flood of Genesis 6.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.900]   He did no one any wrong.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.760]   He was perfectly just in that judgment.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.000]   Until we feel the depth and horror
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.680]   of sin like this, much of the Bible
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.820]   will simply make no sense to us at all.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.820]   Fourth, Job is in the Bible, like all other descriptions
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.880]   of suffering of the righteous, to help us be ready
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.480]   for our own suffering with confidence
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.080]   that it is not ultimately owing to caprice
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.840]   or to nature or to sinful man or to Satan,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.520]   but it is in the hands of our all-wise,
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.340]   all-powerful, all-good Father.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.720]   This dad says of his daughter, quote,
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.020]   "It does not bring her much comfort to think
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.020]   "that following God could result in such devastation."
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.700]   And my response to that sentence is this.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.000]   God doesn't expect us to be comforted
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.240]   by the suffering that following him will bring.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.640]   He expects us to be comforted that all the suffering
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   he appoints for us will be for our ultimate good,
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.940]   for the advancement of his wise purposes,
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.140]   and that he will keep us for himself through them all.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.720]   But it sounds like this young lady has not made peace
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.920]   with the promise that if Jesus suffered,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.800]   his followers are going to suffer.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.400]   That's a promise.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.440]   I've been struck with this again recently
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.720]   as I'm working my way through 2 Thessalonians
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.200]   for a look at the book.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.180]   Paul says in chapter one in verse five
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.940]   that the very affliction that the new Christians,
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.660]   baby Christians, like several weeks old as Christians,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.680]   are enduring afflictions, and he says this,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.600]   "This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.500]   "that you may be considered worthy of his kingdom
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.280]   "for which you are suffering."
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.680]   Wow.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.020]   Paul had said to these brand new Christians
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.640]   in 1 Thessalonians chapter three, verse three,
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.480]   "Don't be moved by your affliction,
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.660]   "for you know that we are destined for this."
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.360]   And now it has happened, and he calls it
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.180]   the righteous judgment of God to fit us for heaven.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.340]   Oh, how pastors and youth leaders
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.920]   need to teach the biblical doctrine
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.080]   of the necessity of Christian suffering
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.040]   in obedience to Jesus.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.940]   They need to say to young people
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.440]   that Christ is not calling them to an easy life,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.740]   but to a life of serious joy, not silly joy,
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.160]   and that most of the things young people live for
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.920]   will vanish like mist in the face of real life,
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.740]   especially life in the service of a crucified Messiah.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.920]   So the last thing I would ask of our young friend
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.320]   is that she would pray with me and with her father
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.040]   the prayer that we all need to pray every day,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.040]   namely that the Lord would enlighten the eyes of our heart
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.180]   to see God and to see the world
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.780]   and the way God does things in the world
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.680]   in order that we might make wise judgments the way he does.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.220]   - Yes, amen.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.060]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.500]   And to the father out there who sent us this question,
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.340]   thank you.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.980]   We commend you for your parenting
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.500]   and pray that this episode will be useful to you
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.460]   and your daughter, and that it helps
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.660]   many other listeners out there
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.280]   who are struggling with the same questions.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.160]   Wow.
