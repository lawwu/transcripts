[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:14.560]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.740]   My guest today is Rick Rubin. Rick Rubin is a world-renowned music producer,
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.160]   having worked with an enormous number of incredible artists producing, for instance, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys,
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.380]   Jay-Z, Johnny Cash, Adele, Lady Gaga, Tom Petty, and of course Slayer.
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.880]   This last year, Rick also authored his first book, which is a truly incredible exploration
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.640]   into the creative process. His book is entitled "The Creative Act, A Way of Being."
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.080]   Rick has appeared once before on the Huberman Lab Podcast, and during that appearance, he offered to answer
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.080]   listeners' and viewers' questions. Those questions were put in the comments section on YouTube,
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.800]   and we received thousands of them. So today, Rick answers your questions about the creative process.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.360]   I also took note of the feedback that when Rick previously appeared on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.760]   that perhaps I spoke a bit more than the audience would have preferred. So today,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.880]   I refrain from speaking too much and try and give as much airtime as possible to Rick in order to
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.120]   directly answer your questions. You'll notice that today's discussion gets really into the practical
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.440]   aspects of the creative process. The most frequent questions that I received for Rick were ones in
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.080]   which people really want to understand what his specific process is each and every day, as well
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.000]   as when he's producing music or other forms of art. And of course, people want to know what they
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.360]   should do specifically from the time they wake up until the time they go to sleep, even whether or
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.160]   not they should take note of their dreams, et cetera. We get into all of that. So today's discussion
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.640]   is very different from the one I held with Rick previously, and at least to my knowledge from any
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.660]   of the other interviews or discussions that Rick has had publicly. Before we begin, I'd like to
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.840]   emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is,
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.220]   however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.720]   and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.080]   sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison. Maui Nui Venison is the most
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.160]   nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available. I've spoken before on this podcast, and there's
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.680]   general consensus that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of protein per
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.480]   pound of body weight. Now, when one strives to do that, it's important to maximize the quality of
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.360]   that protein intake to the calorie ratio, because you don't want to consume an excess of calories
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   when trying to get that one gram of protein per pound of body weight. Maui Nui Venison has an
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.880]   extremely high quality protein to calorie ratio, so it makes getting that one gram of protein per
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.600]   pound of body weight extremely easy. It's also delicious. Personally, I like the ground venison.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.320]   I also like the venison steaks. And then for convenience, when I'm on the road, I like the
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.880]   jerky. The jerky is a very high protein to calorie ratio, so it has as much as 10 grams of protein
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.800]   per jerky stick, and it has something like only like 55 calories. So again, making it very easy
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.040]   to get enough protein without consuming excess calories. If you would like to try Maui Nui

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.280]   8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.720]   I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.320]   mental health, physical health, and performance. Now, a key component of getting a great night's
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.160]   sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.280]   drop by about one to three degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.040]   body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees. One of the best ways to make
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.320]   sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.520]   and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.000]   environment. And that's what 8 Sleep allows you to do. It allows you to program the temperature
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.720]   of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.880]   wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized. I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.560]   mattress cover for almost three years now, and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.520]   So much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my 8 Sleep,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.200]   I very much look forward to getting home because my sleep is always better when I sleep on my 8
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.920]   Sleep mattress cover. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8sleep.com/huberman to get
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.140]   $150 off their pod three mattress cover. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.760]   countries in the EU and Australia. Again, that's 8sleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.160]   brought to us by Waking Up. Waking Up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of meditation
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.660]   programs, mindfulness training, and yoga nidra, which is sometimes referred to as NSDR. I'm a
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.200]   longtime fan of meditation. I started meditating when I was back in my teens, and I started doing
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.000]   a daily 10 or 20 minute meditation. And I kept that up for a number of years, but then it became
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.200]   more sporadic. And then eventually I stopped, and then I'd start again, and then I'd stop. What I
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.160]   found with the Waking Up app is that it makes it very easy to take on a meditation practice and to
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.280]   do meditation, if not every day, very close to every day. And that we know based on a lot of
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.540]   research has an outsized positive effect on everything from stress regulation to sleep.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.240]   You come up with better ideas. So indeed, meditation can make you more creative, more focused,
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.480]   and on and on. And then about 10 years ago, I got introduced to yoga nidra or NSDR, non-sleep deep
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.400]   rest, which is a practice of laying completely still while keeping the mind very active. So
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.680]   you're relaxing, but keeping your mind active. And I use NSDR essentially every single day. I'll do
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.140]   it anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, and I find it to be incredibly restorative. It really resets my
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.840]   ability to think and to engage in physical activity. And with Waking Up, I can select
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.160]   different lengths of meditations, different lengths of yoga nidras or NSDRs so that I keep up my
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.520]   practice. If you'd like to try Waking Up, you can go to wakingup.com/huberman to try a completely
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.760]   free 30-day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman to try a free 30-day trial.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.800]   And now for my discussion about protocols for creativity with Rick Rubin. Rick Rubin,
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.440]   welcome back. Thank you, sir. Happy to be here. We're going to answer, or rather you are going
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:42.120]   to answer the questions of the listeners of our previous podcast episode. Before we do that,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.040]   however, when we were out in the lobby, you mentioned that you have a breathing exercise,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.680]   a coherence breathing exercise that you thought might be useful for us to do now and perhaps for
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.800]   some of the listeners to join in. Yeah, let's do it. And then if you want to talk about it after,
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.360]   we can. Sounds good. The reason I started doing this is I have relatively low heart rate
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.720]   variability and you want to have a higher one. So I looked at all the things that can raise your
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.840]   heart rate variability and I started doing this breathing technique specifically for heart rate
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.520]   variability, then it went up. Awesome. So it's tested. Great. Let's do it together here. It'll
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:26.560]   say take a deep breath and then you'll hear the sound of a, if you follow me for the first inhale
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.640]   and exhale, you'll know what sound means what. And you do this eyes closed typically? I do it
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.040]   closed. Okay. We'll close our eyes. Thank you.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   Okay.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   [Inaudible]
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   [Inaudible]
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:26.600]   That was five minutes. I like that. Feels nice, isn't it? Yeah. I noticed I don't
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:34.040]   spontaneously breathe at that cadence. I breathe quite a bit faster. Mm-hmm. So especially on the
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:44.000]   exhale. Mm-hmm. So once I got into a rhythm of it, yeah, the mind just goes pseudo random for me.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.640]   What about for you? Does your mind tend to go one place? I do now I count. So the reason I knew it
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:58.280]   was five minutes is because it's six breaths per minute and I counted five, one, one, one, two,
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:06.720]   one, three, one, four, one, five, one, six, two, one. So I was occupied with a task. How often do
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:13.280]   you do that? At least once and sometimes twice a day. I aim for 10 minutes a day, but if I get
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:21.840]   20 minutes a day, it's noticeable in my heart rate variability results. Do you do the coherence
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.680]   breathing at particular times of day or just whenever it occurs to you? I think it depends
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.800]   on where I am and what else is going on in my life. So I had a window of a very specific thing
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   that I was doing. I would do coherent breathing and I would do squats, just air squats in one
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:48.560]   location where I didn't have any other equipment. And then I found a way like where I was doing
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.360]   treading water, which you got to experience with me, I would tread water. And then after treading
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.840]   water, I would get out of the pool, sit in the sun and do the coherent breathing. Great. Yeah,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.240]   we should probably mention what the treading water was about because people will wonder
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.880]   very briefly. I went and visited Rick overseas this summer and we spent a fair amount of the
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:17.280]   daytime treading water while listening to podcasts from a speaker on the side of the pool. And it was
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:27.120]   awesome. Time together as friends is awesome. Time in the sun is awesome. Learning from podcasts and
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.880]   listening and being entertained by podcasts is awesome. And then treading water is awesome.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.960]   You're much better at treading water than I am. I was fatiguing. It's just, as I said, when we were
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:45.360]   doing it, it's like doing stairs. If you practice doing stairs, it gets easier to do stairs, but
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.800]   nobody's good at doing it. You know, marathon runners can't run up the stairs. It's a particular
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.160]   thing and treading water, if you just do it, even in the little bit of time that we were doing it
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.400]   every day, by the end of your stay, it was easier for you than when you started. Definitely. Yeah.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.920]   You acclimate quickly. Yeah. I was able to adapt. I was impressed at your endurance and treading
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.320]   water early on. By the way, I've continued the treading water practice because I'm fortunate
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.640]   to have a pool in my new place. I listened to your podcast, Truly, Tetragrammaton. Love it.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.680]   Love, love, love it. I listened to a few other podcasts and I've started listening to more
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.560]   episodes of the podcasts that you introduced me to, which was History of Rock Music in 500 Songs.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.680]   Andrew Hickey's podcast. It's an English podcast, great podcast, real in-depth information about
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.160]   music. Yeah. Yeah, that was such a great trip. Thanks for having me over there. Thanks for coming.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.480]   It was fun treading water. It was. Loved the time with you and your family. So I'm going to,
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.440]   I'll invite myself again. You're always welcome. On the topic of meditation, one of the questions
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:56.800]   in this list of questions, we'll talk about the list itself in a moment, was about this anecdote
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.520]   that you've told me and you've mentioned a few other places apparently that you've once meditated
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:08.560]   all the way from, was it San Francisco to New York or Los Angeles to New York flight? It was either
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.680]   LA to New York or New York to LA, I can't remember. And I may have done it more than once. The question
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.200]   specifically was, which meditation did you do? TM. TM was the first meditation I learned,
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:26.480]   transcendental meditation learned when I was 14. It's pretty much a default setting for me.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:35.360]   Now sometimes it'll evolve from TM into breathing. Like I might start by doing breathing before the
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:43.520]   TM piece starts and the breathing may just take the whole time. Or it may turn from breathing
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:50.720]   into a gratitude practice or a meta practice, which is four phrases. May I be filled with
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:57.200]   loving kindness? May I be well? May I be peaceful and at ease? May I be happy? And you repeat those
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.720]   phrases over and over. And it starts may I, and then eventually if you've done it for a year or
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:10.320]   so, you could start saying may we for your immediate family. And then as you build up
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   the charge for your immediate family in another year or so, you can spread it to your community.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.240]   And eventually after maybe five years, you can do it for the planet.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.360]   So that's the meta. Meta, M-E-T-T-A. Amazing.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.760]   Loving kindness practice. And are there any particular links,
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.120]   maybe you could pass us later and we could put in the captions, maybe one that you've used.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.920]   I learned it from Jack Kornfield, who's a Buddhist scholar and a brilliant teacher.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.560]   Terrific. What do you think meditation has allowed you, afforded you,
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:52.080]   as well as what it's helped you avoid in terms of a daily practice, or maybe in just how doing it
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.720]   once in a while has wicked out into areas of your life. This is probably a long list of things, but
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.400]   if you were to pick maybe like the top three where you go, yeah, when I'm meditating
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:08.080]   regularly blank happens and blank doesn't happen. And when I'm not, those things disappear.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.240]   Because I've been doing it for such a long time, it's so part and parcel of who I am
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.120]   that without, I don't know who I would be without it. That said, I don't always do it,
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:29.600]   but I don't have, at this point, I don't have to always do it to be in this zone where I've been,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:40.800]   you know, for almost 45 years, it's been a big part of my life. So a great deal of the benefits
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:48.320]   are in me now. When I practice, it gets amplified. But as Maharishi described it,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.320]   every time you meditate is like making a deposit in a bank. So it's always there. Every time you
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:01.920]   do it, you're building a base. And the goal of the practice is less about the practice. It's about,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.480]   the practice is to change the way you are in the world. So it's a practice for life.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:14.240]   Do you know what I'm saying? Like the changes that come in the meditation
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:21.760]   are to help your reactions in the real world. In some ways, not to trivialize it, but it's like
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.120]   physical exercise. You know, during a good workout, your blood pressure is really elevated. You're
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.800]   secreting all sorts of inflammatory cytokines. You know, if we were to draw your blood mid-workout,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:38.720]   you'd say this person is in trouble. But then all these wonderful adaptations occur that allow you
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:44.880]   to sleep better, better mood, walk up stairs easily, and on and on. It's funny about sleeping
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.920]   better. This morning I was walking on the beach and had my headphones on, wired headphones,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.800]   and I was listening to a podcast. I can't remember what I was listening to, but I was listening to a
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.320]   podcast. And someone flagged me and interrupted me who I didn't know. And I went over to talk to him
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.280]   and he said, "I heard you talking about Steve Martin on a podcast." And he told me a story
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.080]   about Steve Martin that he got to see him in 1979. I would say this person was probably
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:21.120]   mid to late 60s. And he was wearing all black. He was wearing shoes on the beach, tennis shoes.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:32.640]   He was wearing dark sunglasses and a hat. And he said, just want to talk about comedy and things
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.920]   that he heard me say on a podcast and we talked about it for a while. And then he said something
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.080]   about he loves podcasts and he listens to them at night because he's got terrible insomnia and he
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.720]   can't sleep. And I'm looking at a guy in the sun wearing sunglasses and I say, "Well, you know,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.760]   the reason you can't sleep is because you're wearing sunglasses now." He said, "What are
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.000]   you talking about?" I said, "Well, the way the human body works is we react to the sun. The sun
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.760]   is what tells us we're awake. And then at night when it's dark, that's what tells us to go to
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:06.560]   sleep. So you're mixing the signals to your body by wearing the sunglasses." And he said, "Well,
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:13.280]   I'm a dermatologist." He said he was a dermatologist for the last 40 years.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.440]   And my whole practice is about getting people to get out of the sun.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:28.560]   We started talking about it. And he was all covered up. I was wearing my board shorts and
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:36.480]   nothing else. And I said, "Well, I'm in the sun hours every day." And he's like, "Aren't you
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:43.840]   worried about cancer?" And I said, "No, I feel pretty healthy. I feel okay." And then he said,
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.360]   "Let me see your back." And I turned around and he looked at my back. He's like, "You have perfect
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:58.160]   skin. They should study you in an institute." I said, "This is what normal healthy skin looks like
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.600]   if you expose it to the sun." And he said, "So you're saying everything I've been teaching in my
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:10.160]   medical practice for the last 40 years was wrong?" I said, "Yes, everything." It was funny. Funny
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.640]   conversation. - Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, we could go down a deep rabbit hole with this,
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:20.080]   but listeners of this podcast will know that I'm very much a proponent of getting those sunlight
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:26.480]   signals to the eyes at least once a day in the morning, but also in the evening. I'll just share
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:35.360]   with you now, I learned from a guest whose episode we haven't aired yet that what is so special about
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.800]   that morning and evening sunlight are the contrast between blues and oranges, blues and reds, blues
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.120]   and pinks, that we can't always see if there's cloud cover, but they come through. And it's the
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:51.440]   mathematical difference in their presence, a subtraction of a lot of blue and then next to it,
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.520]   a lot of orange or a lot of blue and then next to it, a lot of pink that triggers the body's
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.480]   understanding that this is morning and evening and that night is coming in the evening and that it's
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.600]   time to be awake in the morning and throughout the day. In the middle of the day, when the sun
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.160]   is out and it's overhead, it looks like white light and white light includes the blues and
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.920]   the oranges and the pinks and the reds, but they subtract to zero because they're all mixed
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.920]   together. That's why it looks just blue and white. And so while bright light is great throughout the
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:27.040]   day, it's those morning signals. Now the, I think the dermatology community is starting to come
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   online with the idea that low solar angle sunlight early and later in the day, sunrise and sun rising
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.480]   and sun setting. And I say that because people always go, oh, do you have to see across the
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:43.120]   horizon? That would be ideal, but rising and setting do not create the kind of skin damage
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.640]   or eye damage that they've been so concerned about. And I think the next step for the field
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.520]   of dermatology is going to be to start communicating with the neuroscientists and the
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.640]   circadian biologists and really learning that. So thanks for bridging that gap on the beach this
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.320]   morning. I do think that's how it starts and then it wicks out. Headphones. So I made the choice a
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.920]   few years ago to stop using the Bluetooth headphones based on my personal experience,
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.520]   which was I kept getting these cysts behind my ears, which I was told were lymph, swellings of
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.640]   lymph. They would actually drain lymph if they got big enough. It was, there was really gross and
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.360]   kind of troubling. I stopped using them. I didn't get them. I started using them again. I started
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.440]   getting those lymph things and, and there was some significant heat effects as well. And I've
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.920]   interviewed a couple of people, including a neurosurgeon on the podcast about the level of EMS
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.480]   that come from them. And they were not concerned. Others I've spoken to are concerned. I'm going to
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.960]   try and balance out the conversation over time, but my feeling was, look, if there's any concern
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:51.440]   whatsoever, why would I use them? And I, so I use the ones with wires, but use the ones with wires
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:58.160]   that are even one step further away from wifi transmitters. There are ones with air tubes
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:06.240]   that I use depending on what's going on. And those have no electrical, there's no electric
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.080]   near your head. It's just an air tube where the sound is traveling. This actual sound is traveling
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.920]   in the tubes to your ears. I definitely sleep better with the phone out of the bedroom. Some
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.800]   people are now turning off their wifi at night. I think you and I are both really aligned in the
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:29.440]   sense that we've seen enough things come and go in the health space, like disparaging remarks about
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.920]   lifting weights. Like that's just for bodybuilders. And now everybody knows muscle bound. You become
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.800]   muscle bound. Now, men and women, elderly and young are encouraged to do resistance training.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:46.400]   Yoga used to be cast in this kind of magic carpet realm, breath work. All of this stuff has become
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.120]   over time mainstream, but it's taken a very long time and the road has been choppy and sometimes
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:57.280]   my opinion, really unfair to the, to the practices and their value. I mean, these are zero cost
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.880]   practices in many cases that can really help people. And so when I look at something like
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.160]   sunscreen or, or, you know, Bluetooth headphones, or we're talking about some of these things,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.880]   I wish I had a portal into the future where we look back and go like, of course,
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:17.040]   of course. So what are your thoughts on just kind of health and wellness as you've observed it in
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.600]   the last 20, 30 years? I mean, you've been in this for a while. I mean, you paid attention to
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.920]   mindfulness and mind, body stuff. You know, what are your thoughts? I try to live in as natural
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:34.720]   way as possible. I try to eat as few processed foods as possible, try to eat grass fed animals.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:43.760]   And I use hardly any products of any kind, you know, that, that aren't just something that grows
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.160]   or lives on the planet. There were a couple of questions about this, so I'll ask now.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.840]   You lost a tremendous amount of weight. You look great by the way. Thank you. You look super fit.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.440]   Every time I see you, you're in better and better shape. And that's, that's in,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:06.000]   that's your perception. It's not in fact the case. I don't know when I see each time you, I mean,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.280]   you're extremely mobile, you you're sleeping well, you have a robust life, like, you know,
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:19.200]   I mean, all the marks of health and vitality. So I've heard you mentioned before that you lost a
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:25.760]   significant amount of weight. How much weight and how did you do it? 135 pounds through a high
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:36.640]   protein, low calorie, low carb diet. And that went against the convention at the time? Well,
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:44.640]   the person who suggested it was someone at UCLA. So it was a mainstream doctor who helped me with
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:51.600]   my weight loss. I had been a vegan at that time, which was not mainstream then. And it was very
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:57.360]   unhealthy, but I did that for 20 some odd years because I believed in the theory of it, but it
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:04.000]   proved not to be healthy for me. Do you think that different diets likely work for different people?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.840]   Yes. So that not everyone necessarily should do what you did? No, no, but I think most people
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:18.240]   would probably benefit from healthy red meat. I'm saying that only because it's so vilified in our
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   culture. Yeah, I agree. And I think the healthy piece is key there to non factory farmed animals,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.200]   which fortunately reasonably cost sources that are becoming more available.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:36.320]   Well, I'm going to start pulling from the list of questions. By the way, folks, there were more than
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:43.840]   a thousand questions in just the one third printout that I did. It's an intimidating stack
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.120]   in front of you. It's the most notes I've ever put in front of me during a guest discussion here on
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.920]   the podcast. And we are not going to ask you every question, but I've organized them in some sense of
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.160]   coherent order. Did you organize them or did AI organize them? I organized them,
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.840]   but that's a great opportunity to ask you one of the questions that came up several times,
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:12.400]   which was what are your thoughts on AI and its ability to shape how music is made,
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:18.880]   how visual arts are made? Are you one of these like scared of AI or do you embrace new technology?
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:25.760]   I don't know enough about it yet to talk about it. What I will say is what I find interesting
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.640]   about art is the point of view of the person making it. And I don't know that AI has a point
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   of view of its own. So I don't know how interesting it would be, AI's point of view.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:44.800]   But I like people's points of view and what makes an artist a great artist to me is something about
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:52.320]   their point of view does something to me. Childhood. A question for Rick Rubin was
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:58.720]   what activities did you find most enjoyable and easy to get lost in as a child? I love this
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:04.320]   question for you in particular. Reading was a big part of my life. Listening to music was a big part
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:10.480]   of my life. Playing guitar along with music can't really play, but the idea of playing along. So it
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.680]   didn't have to actually be good enough to play along because I didn't have that skill set,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.720]   but I liked the experience of doing my best to play along with something I was listening to.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:35.120]   And also magic. Learning like shuffling cards in front of a mirror and coin tricks and slide of
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:41.200]   hand was just interesting to me. Do you still do magic? I don't. Okay. At the time that music took
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.720]   over my life, I had to choose between the two because both of them were full-time life pursuits.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.120]   I went and saw a mentalist in New York this summer with my sister, Asi Wind is his name,
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:27:00.880]   A-S-I, first name, last name, Wind. Every time I see a mentalist, and especially when I see Asi,
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:08.880]   I've seen him twice, it blows my mind. What are your thoughts on mentalists? It's my favorite
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:17.840]   form of magic. Really most interesting because it doesn't rely on props. It's pure.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:31.040]   It feels like pure magic. If you have a box and you pull something out of the box,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:37.600]   there's probably something tricky about the box. But when someone can look at you and tell you what
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:47.920]   you're thinking, it's just wild. It's really wild. So I love that. After Asi did his act,
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:53.120]   when we pseudo-returned to reality, because it really does change the way you look at
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.320]   things after that for quite a while, maybe forever. I asked him if he was willing to share
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:04.000]   maybe just one nugget of insight into how he does what he does. And of course I wasn't expecting he
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.360]   was going to give away the whole thing. And he said, a lot of it has to do with forming and
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.840]   erasing memories in people quickly, which sounds very dark and mysterious. That's really
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.960]   interesting. Yeah, that maybe it's possible to erase memories in people. Like maybe what we
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.920]   thought we saw, we really didn't see or hear. Wow. So I dig that. Great description. Yeah.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.760]   I'm going to bring him out here, by the way. So we should all get together. I would love to see that.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:37.520]   I want to get him on the podcast. Okay. A full 10% of the questions for you
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:47.040]   were around writer's blocks, sticking points, this kind of thing, like feeling stuck in the creative
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.400]   process. Now people didn't specify whether or not they were stuck at the beginning, the middle of
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:59.840]   the end, but based on my read of all of these questions, I got the sense that people were
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.000]   feeling like there's something in them that they want access to. They want to create, but they
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.400]   don't know how to get past that initial stage as opposed to somebody who's like 90% done and they
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:17.680]   just can't finish the last 10%. What are your thoughts about these kinds of blocks and how to
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:24.560]   overcome them? Any experience you've had with them yourself and perhaps with working with other
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:35.760]   artists? The first thought is to go past the idea of the block and think about what's the cause of
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:44.720]   the block. And the block is usually something like, it's either a personal, I'm not good enough.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:52.960]   It can be a confidence issue. I don't have anything to say. Or it could be a
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:30:01.760]   thinking about someone else. Nobody's going to like what I make. Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:09.600]   So it's either a self-judgment or a fear of outside judgment. So if you're making something
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:20.960]   with a freedom of, this is something I'm making for myself for now, that's all it is.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:29.680]   It's a diary entry. Everything I make is a diary entry. The beauty of a diary entry is
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:40.080]   I can write my diary entry and you can't tell me my diary entry wasn't good enough or that's not
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:46.000]   what I experienced. Of course, it's what I experienced. I'm writing a personal diary
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:55.120]   for myself. No one else can judge it. It is my experience of my life. Everything we make
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:08.400]   can be that, can be a personal reflection of who we are in that moment of time. It doesn't have to
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.920]   be the greatest you could ever do. It doesn't have to have any expectation that it's going to
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:20.560]   change the world. It doesn't have to be this has to sell a certain number of copies for any reason.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   It doesn't have any of those things. All it is is I'm making this thing. I'm making this thing for
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:32.560]   me and I want to do it to the best of my ability to where I feel good about it and where it's honest.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:39.120]   It's honest of where I'm at. And if you're living in this world of just being honest to where you're
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:45.840]   at, there's nothing blocking that. Do you know what I'm saying? There are no blocks. The blocks
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:56.160]   are all based on dealing with a different force or a different perception that is made up. You make
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:02.880]   up the story and you're living the story. I'm in this block because I just can't do it. The reason
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.760]   you can't do it is because you're afraid someone else is not going to like it or you're there's
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:15.360]   no blocks. There's infinite amount of information out there to work with because it also doesn't
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:23.200]   stem from us. We're vehicles for this information and it's coming through us all the time. So if you
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.800]   don't have an idea when you're sitting at your desk, if you go for a walk, chances are you'll
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:36.720]   see something that'll spark something in you as a seed to take off from. That makes a lot of sense.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:43.040]   That makes a lot of sense. And I had a thought while you were saying that one of the challenges
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:49.920]   that I have in completing work and getting into a good work groove is that, especially nowadays
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.040]   because of phones and so easy to communicate with other people, it's not that they interrupt me.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:00.480]   It's that, and this happened the other day, I set up my new office really nicely. I'm living in a
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:07.040]   very quiet place now. It's like almost completely silent unless I'm playing music. It's really
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.960]   interesting. Or the coyotes sometimes come around and start doing their thing at night, but
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.320]   completely silent. And I realized I was having a hard time getting into a work groove.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.360]   And I realized that I felt compelled to continue to reach out to people. And then I realized,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:28.160]   as you just provided your answer to the last question, that there's probably something in
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:36.320]   me that has a bit of a fear of separation or abandonment from people based on my own experience.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   And I feel very well supported by my friends and coworkers these days. Very, very well supported.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:48.240]   I'm in a kind of pinch me place around that. And, but I realize now that what's happening in my mind
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.240]   is it's not a challenge of getting into the work. It's a fear that if I spend a couple of hours
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:34:01.040]   really in that tight tunnel of creation, that there might not be anyone there when I exit it,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.640]   which is a crazy thought. But that's the anxiety. And I only realize that now. So thank you.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:12.800]   I trust that you guys will be there when I exit the tunnel. And when there's a deadline,
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.480]   I have no choice but to jump into that tunnel. That's actually what helps. Deadlines really
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.880]   help me. Do deadlines help you? Do you like deadlines? Deadlines don't help me at the
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:29.760]   beginning of a process. They can help at the end. Once the code's been cracked, usually when I start
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:36.080]   something, I have no idea what it's going to be. So it's a very open process in the beginning.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:44.320]   And if there's any sense of required timing, that would undermine the freedom needed for it to be
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.040]   all that it could be. But once the code's cracked and you know what it is, and it's all there,
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:56.640]   and you're dealing with the fine points, then it can be really helpful to have a deadline.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:02.880]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012. So I'm delighted that they're
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.760]   sponsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.000]   your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.920]   minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:21.200]   But oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.560]   minerals and the probiotics that I need. And it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.920]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1. I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.800]   and it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take just
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:44.880]   one supplement, what would it be? I answer AG1. If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.840]   to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:57.760]   D3K2. Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman. - A number of questions were sort of comments
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:04.480]   about what people believe your process is. And one of the repeating themes there,
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.400]   which I thought was interesting, was it seems that Rick Rubin is comfortable with uncertainty
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:17.520]   and the unknown. - Yes, that is true. Yes, I am comfortable with it because I accept
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:24.880]   that's the way things are. That said, when I start a new project, I always have anxiety because
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:33.840]   I'm uncertain of what's gonna happen and I want it to be good. Now, I know it won't be done until
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:43.120]   I feel good about it. So in that way, there's no real pressure, but I do still feel this anxiety
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:49.760]   of, "I wonder what's gonna happen today. I hope it's good." - When you've worked with musical
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:58.160]   artists, let's say, how important is it to you to know what challenges, maybe even what successes,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.000]   but certainly what challenges they happen to be going through at that period of time?
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:10.640]   Put differently, do you end finding yourself playing therapist and guide and psychological/emotional
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:18.560]   mentor to artists you work with during the creative process, or is that separate? - If they're going
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.280]   through something that's interfering with the work, anything that gets in the way of the work
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:30.640]   is something worth discussing. Our focus there together is to get the work done. Sometimes it
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:38.160]   ends up being more therapeutic to allow that to happen. - One of the questions that really stood
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:45.200]   out to me in this vast list of questions involved a quote from your last discussion on this podcast,
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.400]   our last discussion on this podcast. So I'm gonna read a little bit of it 'cause it's fairly long,
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.600]   but I found this to be a really important question that we should get into in a bit more depth.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   Somebody, I don't know who said, if you happen to talk to Rick, I happen to be talking to you,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:08.080]   ask him this for me. In his book, in the section on self-doubt, Rick said, quote, "One of the reasons
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.640]   so many great artists die of overdoses early in their lives is because they use drugs to numb a
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.200]   very painful existence. The reason it is painful is the reason they became an artist in the first
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.400]   place, their incredible sensitivity. If you see tremendous beauty or tremendous pain where other
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.360]   people see little or nothing at all, you're confronted with big feelings all the time.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:36.240]   These emotions can be confusing and overwhelming." So this goes on for some pages. And then this
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.880]   person says, and I think they're speaking for many people when they said, "This resonated with
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.800]   me personally. And I wonder whether or not this is something that maybe you've experienced yourself
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:51.120]   or that you just noticed about artists in similar situations. And what sort of advice do you give
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:57.600]   the artists you work with in order to embrace those painful tones within them and transmute
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:04.720]   them into great work?" I've definitely felt them myself. I'm unusually sensitive in the world.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:15.600]   I'm wearing red glasses in here for a reason. I live a very protected monk-like life because
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:26.480]   simulation gets in the way of my ability to be where I want to be. So I tend to stay away from
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:43.520]   things. And it seems to be the case with many artists, a desire for nurturing their internal
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:54.400]   life. And if the goal is to nurture our internal life, it invariably leads to sacrifices.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.960]   Did you spend a lot of time alone as a kid? I'm asking this question.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.920]   I did. Yeah, I was the only child and I spent most of my time alone.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:07.520]   When you talk about controlling this amount and type of stimulation in your life to protect that
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:14.080]   inner landscape, does that pertain to certain personality types, even voice types? I've found
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:21.280]   at various times in my life, I love people, but there are certain voices that just grate on me
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:29.040]   and I can't be around them. I just can't be around them. It's like a cacophony inside. I just feel
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.560]   like I'm being asked to drink something that tastes awful. Does that resonate?
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.440]   I try to curate the people around me to be people I want to have around me, whatever that is.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:48.320]   You said you protect the inner landscape, but certainly you're not averse to high intensity
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.960]   stimulation. Last night we went to the AEW and by the way, thank you for taking me. That was such an
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.800]   incredible experience. It was really fun.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.920]   It was really fun. It reminded me of early punk rock shows where I really did some of
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:05.200]   my first punk rock shows where I went and just was like, Oh my gosh, this is exciting and scary.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:12.960]   And I love it. And it felt loving too, which is also the community of punk rock that I observed
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:18.160]   and have been blessed to be a part of. It's like, yeah, there's aggression, but there's also love.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.120]   And then there's romance. And then there's also betrayal and there's all the elements,
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.280]   but there's still a sense of like, everyone wants to be here. And there's a sense of goodness behind
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:33.680]   it all, even though some of it was bloody and violent. So for you, what does wrestling allow
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:39.600]   you to feel in those high intensity environments? It completely relaxes me because there are no
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:47.120]   stakes. You know, nobody, everyone's working together in the show to protect each other.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.960]   No one's trying to hurt anybody regardless of what the story line is. It's like a ballet where
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:01.360]   there's a fight in the ballet. There's no, there's no actual aggression of people towards each other.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:10.640]   It's just the opposite, but you get to experience this wildly dynamic, exciting, surreal theater
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:18.880]   piece where people are doing these gymnastic and acrobatic things that are truly death-defying.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:29.280]   And it's fun. And the storylines absorb you in a way where, you know, you never know what's true
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.960]   and what's not. You know, we know wrestling's fake. We're told wrestling's fake, but there's
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:44.480]   something legitimate about it that seems to me more legitimate than anything else. The most
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:51.920]   legitimate because it's the closest to what the world's actually like. People don't always tell
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.880]   you what they really think. And when someone tells you a story, it might not really be the true story.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.200]   They may even think they may be, they may think they're telling you the real story.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:11.760]   And that might not be the real story. We don't know. We know so little. You know, we experienced
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:17.920]   something and then we make up a story to understand it ourselves. And then forever more when we tell
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.280]   that story, it was our version of an experience, but we don't know that's what happened. That was
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:34.080]   our take on it. Wrestling is like, that's what the real world is like. Because when you watch
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:39.520]   wrestling, you never know what's true. That's what, if you watch the news, like you watch
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.320]   wrestling and you never know what's true, it would be more accurate. You'd have a better sense of the
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.440]   world if you took it all in like it was pro wrestling. I think we're in a place in human
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.720]   history where people are starting to feel that way about the media. It's also why wrestling's
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.440]   so popular. You know, it's more popular than it's ever been. Yeah, that's interesting. Things like
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:09.040]   UFC, kind of gladiator like octagon fights and wrestling are increasing in popularity, despite
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.560]   the fact that supposedly we're evolving. So I think it reflects something both primitive and
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.160]   evolved about the human brain. Yes. Right. Primitive in the sense that, yeah, there's some
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.640]   violence. It's physical. That's down in the hypothalamus, as we'd say. It scratches that itch,
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:33.840]   but they're actually protecting each other. It scratches that itch of seeing the gladiators,
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:40.800]   but it's like watching a movie. They're not really hurting each other. They get hurt,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:46.560]   but only because the things they're doing are so crazy. I think in order to be able to thoroughly
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:52.160]   enjoy wrestling, one has to be able to give up narrative distancing just a little bit,
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.800]   right? Narrative distancing is this sense that this is a story, it's a movie, it's not real,
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.920]   but there were moments like yesterday, the jump off the top rope onto the guy who splayed out
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:08.080]   on the ladder, the ladder breaks. This was right in front of us. It couldn't have felt good. No,
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:17.920]   he walked away. He seemed fine-ish, but that, and then there was a match between two women where a
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.400]   woman put a metal plate into the bottoms of her suit and then ran and then jumped onto the other
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.640]   woman and hit her with the metal plate. Then the metal plate slipped out and she was walking around
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.920]   and everyone knew she had cheated because you're not supposed to use the metal plate.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.560]   So it was exciting because she had done it, exciting because she had
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.760]   gotten away with it. And then at the same time, exciting and upsetting that the referee
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:48.000]   saw it, but then didn't call it. This is like Twitter X. This is like Instagram. This is like
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.960]   politics. This is like, this is real life, right? Like seeing people get away with things is so
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.840]   frustrating if you feel they shouldn't have. Yeah. That's all part of it. It's like, it's a very
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:06.000]   accurate representation of the world. Love it. It's weird because I never would have thought
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.280]   I'd be hooked. I'm hooked. It's like archery and professional wrestling. Now it's like,
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:17.680]   I'm going to be busy guy in 24. I'm going to come back to this very practical question and ask a
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:24.400]   different question first. There are a few comments in here that are just priceless by the way.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.880]   Someone wanted to point out that you're a Pisces and so was Einstein.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.880]   A couple of historical questions. I know you're not big on answering historical questions
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.800]   necessarily. Maybe you are, but I can't help every time I see you asking a question about
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:48.240]   the Ramones or asking a question about Joe Strummer. But I like this question. First of
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:53.520]   all, it starts off. I love Rick Rubin. He's so fascinating. There are so many questions that
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:47:01.280]   start that way on the podcast that you did with Joe Rogan. You talked about your experience with
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:07.680]   Johnny Cash and seeing him in a new light after doing interviews for a book about Johnny or
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:14.240]   something like that. The question this person asked was from your present view, what was the
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:19.600]   most impactful moment or moments from being with him and working with him? Or simply do you recall
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:26.320]   a moment working with Johnny Cash that you particularly enjoyed? I enjoyed any time I got
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:38.240]   to spend time with him. He was a really soulful, serious, shy, quiet man. Incredibly knowledgeable.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:44.880]   He knew a great deal about history and so much about music. He knew every song. He may not have
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:53.680]   known modern songs, but he knew the history of music really well. There was just a humble
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:01.600]   honesty about him that came through. I think that the strength of him as an artist was
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:07.440]   when he said words, even if he didn't write the words, if he told a story in words,
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:14.400]   you believe that story. So he had a credible gravitas.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:23.840]   He was great because of who he was. It wasn't his ability as a singer. It wasn't his ability
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.160]   as a songwriter, although he was a great songwriter and he was a great singer,
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.400]   but that's not why he was Johnny Cash. He was Johnny Cash because of the human being
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:41.360]   underneath and anything that guy would have done, we would be interested in because that's how much
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.920]   of a beam of light he was on the planet. It just happened to be music.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:55.280]   It just happened to be music. I love that. One question that came up a lot, and I think I can
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:02.720]   understand why, which is how does one convince themselves that what they're doing and working on
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:08.480]   is worth it? And I think here we have to define worth it and we can find that in a number of ways,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.920]   but I think this is a feeling that I hear people express a lot. How do I know if I'm on the right
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:19.840]   path? And I just want to remind your earlier answer that you're pretty comfortable with
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:24.800]   uncertainty and the unknown. And I think that's a rare trait.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:32.160]   The question of worth it is reliant on an outcome. We don't make these things for an outcome.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:42.400]   It's not the mindset to make something great. The outcome happens, you're making the best thing you
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:52.720]   can make. It's a devotional practice. Whatever happens after that happens and that part that
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:59.120]   happens after it is completely out of your control. Putting any energy into that part that's out of
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:05.280]   your control, it's a waste of time. All it does is undermine your work. Your work is to make the best
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:12.720]   thing you can. So any thought you have about outcome undermines the whole thing. Let that
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:18.080]   one sink in. I think that's so important for people to hear. And I'll say it's okay to think
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:23.360]   about outcome after you've finished the thing you're making. Once you've made it, then you
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:30.800]   can say, "Hmm, what can I do to turn people onto this?" But in the making of it, it's premature.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.680]   Which brings my mind back to that diary entry-like approach. Because when you do a diary entry,
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.520]   if you lie to yourself, you're going to get a lot less out of it.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.040]   It's a ridiculous idea, lying in your diary entries.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.680]   It is. Well, it's so interesting because when you learn how to do really good science,
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.280]   and I was fortunate to work with someone who was truly committed to the truth and accuracy.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.000]   She used to just say, whenever there was a scandal published, someone fabricated data,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.040]   she was like, "This is so crazy. Why would you get into science?"
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.440]   If you want to make stuff up, you'd be better off going to something else. So clearly they weren't
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:14.320]   those people who make up data were not in science for discovery of truth as best we can understand
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:18.640]   it. They were into it for something else. But it's the same way you formulate a question,
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:24.160]   then a hypothesis, and then you just go see what is and what isn't. And then afterwards you decide,
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.320]   "Well, is this a paper that's sent to a top journal or a mediocre journal?" But you can't
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:34.800]   control the outcome. So it's very similar. Exactly the same. And you'll see it in so many
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:40.400]   different aspects of life beyond art. I think one of the things that was interesting that came up in
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:48.160]   writing the book is it started being about art, and I came to realize as I was putting the ideas
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:54.400]   together that it seems like regardless of what you do in life, if you follow these principles,
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:00.640]   your life will probably improve. You'll probably be a better husband or a better father or better
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:11.440]   whatever it is. It seems like the art is an outgrowth of why the subtitle is a way of being.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:17.680]   It's like you create yourself in a way in the world where the things that you make
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:24.960]   are tapped into something deep. But that comes from you being tapped into something deep. That's
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:34.560]   how it works. So tapping into self, grounding in self, not thinking about outcome, diary entry-like
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:42.320]   approach to creating stuff. That seems to be the... And I think one thing I'll say that because I say
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:50.720]   tapping into self, it doesn't come from the self, but you have to tap into yourself because you're
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:56.320]   the vessel to allow it to come out. Everything in the vessel is coming from somewhere else.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:11.520]   It's not your creation. It's like you're the sculptor or you're the
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:19.120]   data analyst. We are taking these things from different places that you've noticed.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.640]   Some things that you've noticed, some things that you don't know that you've noticed, but you did.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.960]   That's how we learn. We take in a lot of information that we don't even know we're taking in.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:34.160]   But the way we can take these data points that are inside of us, that came from outside of us,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:42.960]   and create a constellation. That's what the artist's job is. But also, that's what we all
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:50.480]   do all the time. And to get better at it, it's getting more in tune with yourself and opening
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:54:00.080]   yourself to things outside of... I'll say if you have a narrow belief system, you'll have less
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:08.320]   information to work with, less data points. So being open-minded and allowing surprise to be
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:17.920]   surprised, holding all of your beliefs very loosely. It's interesting because the way you
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:23.680]   describe this and from knowing you as well, it seems that this whole process is best served by
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:31.360]   having really good boundaries, not getting foggy about what's about you and what's about somebody
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:38.080]   else or about what other people want or the world wants, but also having really good antennae and
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:44.160]   being able to see what's happening in the world. You can't be cloistered and like this, but part
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:50.720]   of the creative process feels and looks like you're in a tunnel, but then you have to bring
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:56.800]   in from the outside. So it seems like making these two separate compartments that you can
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.920]   bridge seems important and healthy. I mean, here, as you mentioned, it's a way of being. It's not
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.600]   just about creating things. That's also a healthy way to be in the world because if you're constantly
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.400]   getting pulled around by everything emotionally and things are upsetting you, that's not good.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:17.440]   But if you're just cut off from everything, that's not good either. Do you cultivate
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:24.720]   that way of being through these practices or do you think you've been, there's something
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:29.520]   about the way you're wired that you started off that way? It feels natural to me. It feels natural
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.960]   to me. And I'll tell you, when I was younger, I thought I would live in New York City my whole
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:39.600]   life. And there was a time when I felt like having that energy and noise around me felt good. Now I
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:46.720]   feel best in the jungle or the forest. I didn't decide that. I didn't decide what feels good,
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:52.480]   you know. It just happened. So you're clearly willing to update and adapt, change your
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:59.360]   nutrition, change your city, change the way you feel. Get new information, update. Love it.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:06.240]   You're a scientist. Well, I don't know anything. Again, we start with I know nothing. We all know
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:12.480]   nothing. So if something sounds interesting, worth trying, I'll try it. See, does it work,
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:18.240]   does it not work? You know, I thought at one point in time, I thought veganism was a good idea. I was
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:24.720]   excited about it. And I did it for a long time. I didn't get the results I was hoping for. I didn't
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:30.560]   have better health. I had much worse health. I had, you know, a tremendous amount of weight gain,
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:36.080]   and I was very ill through that diet. But I didn't, my intentions were good.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:43.120]   How do you approach resistance, especially resistance in other artists you work with?
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:49.280]   You know, presumably people hire you. They want to work with you. They do want to work with you.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:54.160]   But I think what the person is asking here is if somebody you're working with is stuck,
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.760]   like they're stuck, do you ask them to think? Do you ask them to feel? Do you ask them to take a
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:05.200]   day off? Do you do a Dennis Rodman on them and send them to Vegas to party for a couple of days?
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:13.120]   Because that's what worked for Dennis. Do you leave them alone? Let them come to you? I think
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.840]   people are very curious about what those sorts of interactions are like.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.000]   I think it's always a case by case situation. It really depends on the artist. It depends on the
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:28.240]   situation. And usually by the time that we're working together, any resistance they had in
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:35.600]   the past has already been overcome. Usually I'm together with someone where we make a team
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:41.120]   with the idea of making the best thing we possibly can. And we'll both do anything we can for that
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:49.280]   thing to be the best it can be. We're past the resistance. I notice you remain friends with a
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:54.160]   lot of the people you've worked with, which is a great testament to you and your work and who you
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:00.160]   are. I just want to mention that. That's not always the case, folks, with other producer-artist
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.720]   relationships. So it's worth pointing out. A practical question, but I think one that
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:12.000]   is worth asking is, do you handle the finances around your work with artists? Do you have
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.160]   someone else do negotiations and all of that kind of stuff? I honestly have no idea how it works.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:25.680]   I have no clue. Everything seems to get done, but I have no idea in the inner workings of any of it.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:35.120]   I try to stay out of as much. If it's not about making the beautiful thing in the moment,
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.520]   I don't really want to think about it too much. I don't want to be involved in that aspect.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.320]   It was interesting when I was visiting you this summer, we had a really delightful
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:51.120]   dinner conversation with one of your other guests. At one point, probably due to me, frankly,
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:56.080]   the conversation veered a bit into the business realm. I'll never forget, you said,
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:02.720]   in a very polite way that didn't feel dismissive at all, you said, "Let's talk about art instead."
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:08.400]   Enough about business. Let's talk about art instead. In that moment-
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.200]   I don't remember that.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:14.000]   Well, I gleaned a lot of gems from that visit. I wasn't there to study you. I was there to hang
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.080]   out with you, but I gleaned so many gems, treading water in the pool, some of the other practices
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:23.840]   we'll talk about. I remember that, and I think about that in myself a lot. In the morning,
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:30.800]   the emails and things coming in, and then I think my purpose in life at this point in my life is to
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.280]   collect, organize, and disseminate health and science information.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:42.720]   That, for me, is art in this sense. Anything else feels boring.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:50.160]   Someone else can do that. You have a particular gift in that you can take complicated scientific
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:56.400]   ideas and explain them in a way that all of us who are not scientists or not medical students
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:03.760]   can understand. It's really helpful. You do it in a kind and loving way where
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:10.480]   we get the sense that you care, that we understand. You explain it in a way that
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:18.320]   there's a care in it that really speaks to us. So thank you for teaching us.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.040]   Thank you, and thanks for the words. That means a lot to me. That is indeed what it is for me. I
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.480]   want people to know the information because I think it's so cool and so important, and they
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:32.160]   need the information, and it's not about me. It's like they have to know. And you did it this
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.880]   morning for this guy on the beach, so he'll see the light, pun intended.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.240]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:47.120]   personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.360]   understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.520]   regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.720]   long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. A major problem with a lot
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:05.600]   of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids,
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.760]   and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker,
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.480]   they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.720]   the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera, but it gives you
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.360]   specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.120]   supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.880]   optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.640]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.400]   Do you prefer the WWE or the AEW, Rick?
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.680]   I love them both. I love pro wrestling. Pro wrestling is great.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:57.280]   How often do you abandon an idea or project? Is there a pile of journals with crossed out ideas
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.120]   some place in Rick Rubin's basement?
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:03.440]   I would say there are many ideas that have not yet come to fruition, but I wouldn't say
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:13.520]   I've abandoned any. It seems like the ideas have a time when they want to come to fruition,
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:19.280]   and regardless of what I think, I don't get to determine the calendar. The ideas come,
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:26.080]   I can get excited about it, I can work on it, and then hit a wall. Nothing else and nothing,
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.600]   it's just impenetrable. Then there'll be another project that's just sailing along easily and the
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:38.160]   universe is working to help support that idea. I tend to work where there are several balls in
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:48.160]   the air at once and I don't fight against... If the universe is not helping a project,
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.360]   I'm wary to fight with the universe.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.320]   How many projects are you working on right now or typically?
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:06.720]   It's impossible for me to even say. There are so many ideas and some of them are in idea phase,
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:14.800]   and some of them are in mid making stage, and some of them are in the final detail stage. There's
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:20.560]   always something happening. I'm always thinking about a lot of stuff. Some of it is stuff that
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:27.520]   I get to share with the world, but some of it might be remodeling a space or I'm always thinking
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:36.480]   about some creative puzzle. I have to imagine that for you, when the internet came to be,
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.280]   that it must have been really exciting because like me, you love foraging for information.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.600]   I used to go to the library and Xerox copy papers and I loved looking through the stacks,
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.720]   but frankly it was physically exhausting and time consuming and financially it was hard for me at
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:58.160]   the time. Then you'd always get those copies where the book crease obscured the text closer to the
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   spine of the book. I love PubMed. The world's at my fingertips. The world of research is at
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:10.880]   my fingertips. My goodness. How do you feel about smartphones and the internet? To you,
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.440]   does it feel like a giant gift for your creative process or is it an inhibitor?
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.200]   It's both. I love that all the information is at our fingertips.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:32.960]   Sometimes having so much information, it's hard to sort. I'll tell you a quick story, which was
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   when the music streaming revolution happened. I was really excited. The idea that all of music
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:47.760]   is in my pocket now and I can listen to any song, any album from any point in my life where I get
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.800]   to hear about something and it's all accessible right now in this moment. I was thinking at that
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:58.000]   time, I'm just going to DJ. All I'm going to do is DJ and I'm going to listen to anything I can
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.280]   think of that I'm excited about. Haven't heard the talking heads in a while. Let's listen to talking
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:07.760]   heads. Just how great that freedom is to have everything at your fingertips. What I came to
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:15.680]   learn very quickly is I don't want to DJ all day. I love that I have the ability to DJ all day.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:23.120]   I love that when there's something I want to hear, I can find it, but I don't want to have to do the
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.200]   work of picking everything I'm going to listen to. I like being programmed to, and I like the
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:35.600]   discovery of somebody else playing something that I wasn't expecting and getting to enjoy that.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:46.240]   So now I do more listening to either somebody's curated playlists or online radio stations and I
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:52.480]   do less picking music to listen to, but I never would have known that before because I always
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.840]   thought, well, if I could listen to anything I want, I want to listen to what I want to listen
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:03.040]   to. I didn't know that I didn't want to have to pick it. I love the rare live versions and
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.600]   B-sides and whatever Z-sides that one can find on YouTube. Like the other day you sent me just
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:16.080]   at random a clip from, I think it was a Japanese television show with the Ramones opening up
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:24.160]   and Johnny opens up with, "You're a loud mouth, baby. You better shut up." And then they dive
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:31.040]   into loud mouth. And it's the song I could have heard anywhere else, but it was the fact that it
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:37.600]   was shot from above, that it was black and white. And then he adds this little riff at the beginning,
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.600]   "You're a loud mouth, baby. You better shut up." And then just dives into it. That made it for me
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:48.160]   as a huge Ramones fan. I was like, yeah, I think I did that in my kitchen. Yeah. I was so hyped
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.760]   because when you go and just listen to a song that's recorded as part of an album,
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:58.080]   you're not going to get those additional pieces back in the day. And still now,
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.600]   if you went to a live show, you might see that and hear that and never forget that.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:09.040]   But in that sense to me, YouTube and the internet is like, whoa, it's this archive of gems that I
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.400]   potentially have been there. Maybe it was '79, I would have been four years old.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:18.960]   So anyway, thanks for sending me that clip. Loved it because you know how much I love the Ramones.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:26.000]   But things like that, I just think, God, the internet is just amazing and so spectacular.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.480]   Yeah. And the amount of lectures you could find on YouTube are unbelievable.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:36.800]   The greatest thinkers in the world, I don't want to say are on YouTube because they probably didn't
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:41.920]   post on YouTube, but their material is on YouTube and it's unbelievable. You know, things from old
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.800]   films from the fifties and sixties, it's all on YouTube. Yeah. I've been listening to Bible
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.840]   interpretation on YouTube and there's just, it's interesting to hear different interpretations
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:57.520]   from different perspectives. And I would have never found these people. Most of them are dead.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.560]   Yeah, they're so good. I'm trying to work through the old Testament start to finish now as a
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:10.000]   learning and a practice and wow. Okay. So the question was, are smartphones the chains that
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.920]   bind us and prevent our creativity? But I think you answered that it's both a
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:24.400]   rocket ship to creativity and chains to the ground. And it's like all of the tools. It's
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.480]   like the tools don't make or break your art. It's just, it's another tool. You can use it or misuse
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:36.640]   it. Someone wanted to know, and I would like to know whether or not you have any recurring dreams
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.880]   and what are your thoughts on dreams and dreaming in general? Do you write down your dreams? Do you
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.360]   spend time thinking about them? I've gone through phases of my life where I've written down dreams.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:53.360]   I'm not doing it right now. I think we can learn a lot from writing our dreams. I tend not to
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.280]   analyze them in the moment, but I've noticed when I've kept a dream journal and looked at it years
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:04.560]   later, these surreal things that made no sense were all saying the same thing and they were all
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.840]   very clear based on my life experience at that time. So it gives us clues as to
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.320]   what's actually going on, the way our subconscious is experiencing our lives. It's giving us,
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:28.160]   I don't know if I would call them pointers, reflections would maybe be a better word.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:36.880]   Our mutual friend, Paul Conte, believes that the unconscious or subconscious is both used
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:44.560]   interchangeably is the supercomputer of the human brain. That the misconception is that the forebrain,
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.320]   which is involved in planning and context and anticipation of outcomes, et cetera,
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.200]   people think that's the supercomputer, but that the supercomputer is the unconscious. That's Paul's
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.080]   belief. He's stated that very clearly on this podcast and elsewhere. And he believes that in
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.320]   dreams, the unconscious mind is controlling more of the dialogue, which makes a lot of sense,
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:10.080]   but also that the unconscious mind is constantly trying to teach us things in the way that we
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.520]   learn best. So like my dreams, for instance, are all analogies because that's pretty much,
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:21.200]   if people listen to me talk on the podcast, I often will use analogy and I'm very visual.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.200]   So it will present things to me in visual symbols. So Paul said in terms of dream interpretation,
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:33.200]   that we would all be wise to think about how we learn best. And our unconscious mind is trying to
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.880]   toss us things in dreams to explain things in the way that we learn.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.920]   It makes sense. And I would say also unconscious and our instinct, the way we act instinctually
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:51.520]   is a reflection of our unconscious. And as artists, that's a tapping into that,
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:59.280]   the instinct and the unconscious is where the great ideas are. And then things that come from our
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.920]   intellectual selves are much less, they have much less of a charge. They're much smaller ideas.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.880]   Yeah, I think the conscious mind and the intellectual mind, as you're calling it,
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:20.640]   are bound to outcome in a big way. I'm going to inject a question of my own.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:28.080]   I'm fascinated by the way you've discussed people's real underlying motivations and how that
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:34.640]   shapes their creative process, but also their career. If you would be willing to talk a little
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.880]   bit about the story of Andrew Dice Clay, that's the story that to me captures it best.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:52.560]   Andrew Dice Clay was a comedian who told really offensive jokes and his audience loved him for it.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:59.920]   But the people who weren't his audience didn't really understand it. And they vilified him.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:06.640]   And he became a comedian because he wanted people to love him. He didn't become a comedian to
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:14.880]   hurt anybody. He wanted to entertain people. And while he was playing to sold out Madison Square
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:23.440]   Gardens full of people, newspapers would write terrible things about him. And it really got to
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:31.920]   him. And he decided to change his artistic output to try to make the people who didn't like him,
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:45.600]   like him. And when he did that, it undermined his whole gift. And it seemed like things fell apart.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.240]   I think he's in a better place now. I haven't seen him in a while, but I think he's in a better place
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:58.800]   now. And he's back to caring less about the reaction and in turn getting a better reaction
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.480]   because he's being pure in what he thinks is funny.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:14.400]   I liked him very much. In fact, I thought he did a spectacular job as playing the female artist's
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.800]   father in A Star is Born. He had Lady Gaga and Brad Cooper.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.960]   He's a really good actor. He's a great actor.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:29.360]   Yeah. Well, I really liked the story about him because it encapsulates so much
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:36.480]   that if people can think about why they do what they do, they're going to avoid pitfalls
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.800]   potentially. But how much time do you think people should spend introspecting
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.000]   about what makes them tick and why they want to entertain or make jokes?
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.120]   I don't think it's a one size fits all. I don't know that I can answer that question.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.800]   Is it true that Ad Rock encouraged you to give LL Cool J a chance?
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:02.080]   Yes, that is true. Ad Rock heard the demo tape and insisted that I listen to it.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:10.640]   I love that. This is a kind of generic question, but I think it's good to put these in every once
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:19.520]   in a while. What is your advice to a starting comedian? I always think of these like sophomore
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.720]   in high school kind of question, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're bad. In some sense,
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.160]   that's what makes it such a great question. What would your advice be to a starting comedian?
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:33.840]   Be true to yourself and not to listen to anyone. There you go. It would be a great book,
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.120]   except it'd be a very short book, but you may also make it a very great book.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:43.280]   Book could be a blank book. You can just put all the things that you want to put in it.
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.520]   I'm working on a book now and I'll tell you it's hard. By the way, I asked Rick for advice about
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.080]   book writing because I've been trying to write this book for a while and he gave me this the
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.960]   following advice. So I'm injecting my own question. He said, the sooner you can get to a complete
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:04.240]   draft that you're happy with or happiest with the better the process will go. So I'm working on
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:09.200]   getting that complete draft. Yeah. I would say don't focus too much on any of the individual
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:15.200]   details until you have the whole thing down and then you can focus on all making everything better
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.080]   that you want to make better. Don't get bogged down in that at the expense of getting through
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:25.200]   the project. Your advice has really been helping me by the way. Great. I'm doing it like diary
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.160]   entries. Great. And I've kept a diary for many years, so that's somewhat natural.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:37.920]   Tell me a little bit about your diary entries. How long is a diary? Sure. Yeah. A diary entry
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:44.720]   is anywhere from like one to eight handwritten pages, single line spacing, going back and forth
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.440]   between. I usually start in all capitals and then switch over to cursive as I speed up.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:56.240]   I've been doing that since, gosh, since high school. I've got a drawer filled with them,
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:04.240]   dated and everything. And it's usually a process of just trying to get something out of my system
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:10.400]   that I feel is like clogging me, some frustration with the outside world. But sometimes like this
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:18.080]   morning, I journaled in the room before you showed up and I just was like, I think I was riding high
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:25.120]   off wrestling last night. I was marveling at how similar the great experiences of my life are now
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:31.440]   as they were to every other stage of my life in the sense that they give me this feeling of like,
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:39.200]   okay, they're these gems and I'm of people, you and others and experiences and I'm finding them,
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.480]   like I'm experiencing them and reminding myself that there are long periods in between those
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:50.640]   moments where things feel kind of like not empty, certainly not empty, but kind of frustrating in
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:55.360]   the sense that like I'm busy and I'm dealing with a bunch of things and things don't feel smooth.
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.920]   But I've been through enough of these cycles that I just
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:07.360]   am really learning to enjoy the cycles. And that was it. And I think the last line in my entry was
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.080]   something like, and I can't wait for more or something. So this morning is just a very positive
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.560]   entry, but sometimes, I mean, there are definitely some tear-stained entries and there are definitely
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.480]   some entries where I'm just so pissed I can barely get the writing out, but it's a process of like
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.720]   getting that stuff out so that then I can lean into the day.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.240]   Do you ever go back and look at them?
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.840]   I did the other day because I recorded an episode on a very particular type of journaling that's
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.800]   supported by over 200 peer-reviewed studies, which is called expressive writing. I can tell you about
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.480]   it. It's a process that was developed by James Pennebaker, who is a professor at University
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:50.400]   of Texas, Austin. And he had his students write as part of an experiment for 15 minutes a day
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:59.040]   for just four days, either consecutive days or a week apart, but about the same thing.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.840]   And the thing that they're supposed to write about is the most challenging,
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.800]   upsetting, or even traumatizing experience of their life. And it shows that the data from
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:13.600]   over 200 studies show incredible positive shifts in psychology, physiology, immune system function,
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:19.920]   and ability to combat infections. I was so struck by the data from this work that I decided to
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:25.120]   dedicate a whole podcast episode to it. It'll probably be out by time this episode airs, but
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.080]   I haven't done that one yet. I'm going to do it. It's a little bit of a higher bar of entry
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.920]   because it's like, okay, I'm going to, I hear that the first day especially is pretty upsetting
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:42.080]   because you're purposely picking something really hard, but yeah, but most of the journaling I do
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.200]   is just kind of diary, like here's what happened. Here's what's going on. And my biggest fear is
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.920]   that somebody would find them. But in preparation for that episode about Pennebaker, I went and
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.440]   looked at my journals and was like, well, what do I write about? And I realized they're pretty
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:01.120]   autobiographical sometimes about troubling things, but never before had I written four times in a row
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.440]   about the exact same thing. - Interesting.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.080]   - Yeah. Yeah. Pennebaker, I think deserves a Nobel prize. If you look at the data on this compared
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:14.160]   to, and I'm not disparaging prescription drugs per se, but like SSRIs for depression, it's like
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:20.480]   at least as good a treatment. It's like zero cost stuff, but it, you know, and on and on,
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.520]   you don't want to be careful. I'll start giving the podcast again now.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.840]   There were a number of questions about quote unquote entertainment and music industry,
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:37.120]   none of which unfortunately were particularly complimentary of quote the industry. And I think
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:43.200]   this is something that comes up a lot because people often focus on the marketing, the
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:48.560]   personalities that may or may not be so pleasant at times. I'm sure there are a ton of pleasant
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:55.200]   personalities in the industry too. But the question is this, how do you deal with the,
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:01.600]   and these are their words, soul crushing anti-creative aspects of the entertainment
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.000]   industry and hold on to that sense of creativity and love for the work?
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.160]   - I'm just focused on the work. I don't think of myself as part of the
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:20.000]   entertainment industrial complex. I just make the things I make and then there are other people who
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.360]   are good at figuring out how to sell them or get them into stores or get them onto services.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:33.680]   - Do you have a process of capturing ideas? Like do you write them down? And the reason this
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.000]   question came up so many times, I think is that a lot of people feel like they get great ideas
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.040]   right upon waking or while driving or in the shower at random times. And they were wondering
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:48.640]   whether or not you have any way of collecting and curating your ideas prior to embarking on
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:54.480]   quote unquote, a project. - I write them, I make notes in my phone. I do it all the time.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:21:01.040]   I don't have a great way of doing it. And sometimes I'll make a note and then come back
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:06.480]   to it later and have no idea what it means. - Do you make those notes by writing or by
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:14.320]   like voice memo? - Writing, that said voice memo might be something worth trying. I've never tried
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:21.680]   that. - How do you view money in relationship to your work? Meaning how do you place it in
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.720]   the constellation of things related to a project? You mentioned earlier you let other people do the
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:34.720]   negotiations, but money is just another form of energy. How do you place it in the contour of
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.240]   what you do? - I try not to think of it at all. Because I come from punk rock background, which
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:45.840]   was like a do it yourself background, it was always more about the idea and the execution of
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:53.920]   the idea with whatever you could use to do it. So if I didn't have enough to go to a professional
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:22:00.320]   recording studio, then I would find a friend who had a home recording studio and record or
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.600]   whatever it was or borrowing a drum machine when I before I had a drum machine, I would always find
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:15.600]   ways to make the things I wanted to make. And I can't remember a time where a financial boundary
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:24.080]   got in the way of making something. And I see it happening a lot around me. And I think some
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.400]   I think some people look at it as the money is what allows it to happen. And I think I just see
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:36.160]   it as the ideas what allows it to happen. And then the ingenuity is figuring out how to do it with,
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:41.920]   you know, by any means necessary, just got to make it. Whatever that version is, it may not be the
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:48.080]   dream version. But whatever version you can execute is the one for you to make. - I can
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:52.880]   attest to the fact that I launched my podcast in my closet in Topanga Canyon, which felt totally
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:58.400]   natural because I also come from the skateboarding punk rock thing where like, wouldn't ever occur to
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:03.920]   me to like, get a professional studio built. Like we're now we had this one built for us. But at the
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:07.840]   time, like, of course, you use a closet because you just need a black backdrop. And, you know,
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:12.720]   I think starting from there makes so much sense. And you also realize in the minimalist approach,
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.440]   you know, anything added is just something added. So you don't really know what you need
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.200]   if you start with a lot of stuff around you. - Yeah. It's, it can just be a distraction.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.800]   I'm friends with Darren Aronofsky, who's a great director. And his first movie was called Pie. And
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:32.640]   he made it for practically no money. And it was really well loved. And then the next movie he made
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:37.520]   was also wildly successful. And he made it for very little money. And then he made this huge
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:44.080]   hundred million dollar movie. And it wasn't, it turned out not to be a success, that movie.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:51.040]   And it was a case of where having more money didn't help him tell a story. It's just one
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:24:00.720]   particular case. And it's no rule to follow. But there is something about making the version that
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:11.520]   you can make with the means that you have that adds something real to the project that may be
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:17.440]   better than the one that has a lot of money thrown at it. - I'm letting that sink in around
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:24.080]   a lot of online tutorials for science have a lot of visuals, but we knew we wanted to do YouTube,
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.400]   but also just pure audio. And there's nothing more frustrating than somebody talking about something
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:33.920]   or somebody that you can't see 'cause you're just listening to it. And the visuals were really
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:40.480]   expensive to do right. And in the end, I think if I firmly believe in the classroom, as well as via
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:47.200]   podcasting, if people can hear something clearly enough and create an image in their own mind of
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:52.560]   how they would visualize it, then it's in there for good. Whereas just having people look at a
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.920]   slide with a bunch of beautiful illustrations on it that does nothing for retention of material.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:04.800]   So I think the minimalist approach, I think sometimes is really the best one. Maybe it's
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:13.760]   always the best one because it forces the better solution. In any case, I do realize I editorialized
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:20.080]   there folks. I entered the answering portion of the, not just the question asking portion.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.680]   Have you ever felt that something was too obscure for mainstream audience appeal to
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:31.040]   the point where you did not release it? - Never. - Tell us more. - If I like something,
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:38.400]   someone else maybe they'll like it. I don't know. How can I judge? How can I judge? I've been told
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:44.800]   with every new thing that I've done, it's a terrible idea and it won't work every single
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.800]   time. - Really? - Every single time. - Ghetto Boys, LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Slayer, Adele.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.560]   - Every one of them. - Eminem. - Every time when I went from producing rap records to producing
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:03.200]   Slayer, you can't do that. You're a rap producer. It's gonna be terrible. Don't do it. Or then
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.720]   Johnny Cash, you can't do that. You're a metal rap producer. You can't do that. It's gonna be
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:17.840]   terrible. Don't do it. Every single time, still to this day. Still to this day. - I was so excited
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.360]   when you launched Tetragrammaton and it's going so well. I listened to every episode. I love the
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:27.760]   interviews. I've been fortunate to be on there twice. I think the second one is still hasn't
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:36.480]   been released yet, but I mentioned Tetragrammaton because it just feels so you, like the Adoreets,
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.000]   which I talked about it during my intro, but the Adoreets are amazing. Like I listened to the
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.320]   Adoreets over and over again because they're so clever and they, I don't know, they put me in a
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:52.960]   state I feel like I'm watching, like I'm transported to as if I was like born in the 1940s. I'm
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:58.160]   listening to television for the first time. There's something there, like there's really something
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:07.360]   there. - It came out of solving a problem. The problem was when I decided to do the podcast,
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.880]   I had even recorded the first several episodes. A friend of mine said, "Well, you're going to have
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:19.440]   to, if you want to have ads on the show to support being able to do the show, then you're going to
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:23.520]   have to read the ads." And I said, "I don't really feel comfortable reading ads. I don't think that's
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:29.440]   something I can do well." I said, "I'm cool with the idea of only advertising products I believe
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:35.120]   in or that I use because that's, if I get to essentially promote something, I'll do that with
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:42.560]   things that I use, but I don't feel comfortable reading it." And he's like, "Well, you have to.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:49.760]   It's going to be expected of you." And it was just an opportunity. It was like, "Okay,
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:57.920]   I understand it's expected of me. What can I do that's true to me that adds something? Instead of
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.600]   it being less than, how can I make it more than?" And it was just solving this problem of needing
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:11.360]   a way to have an advertisement that I didn't feel bad about. And then I got inspired and had this
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.800]   idea and started making them. And now they're my favorite thing in the podcast. In many podcasts,
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:24.160]   honestly, when the ads come up, I forward through them as a listener. On Tetra Grammaton, when a
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:30.560]   commercial comes on, I always listen to them. It's a highlight and they make me smile.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:37.440]   And again, I didn't set out to do that. I just was trying to solve a creative problem.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:45.840]   So sometimes the innovative ideas don't come when you're looking for an innovative idea.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:52.400]   It's just, there's this slot to fill. This is the way it's normally done. I'm not comfortable doing
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:57.840]   it the normal way. How else can we solve this problem? And sometimes it doesn't just solve
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:03.200]   the problem, but it becomes an actual feature. Yeah. There's something about that solution
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:12.240]   seeking that is part of, or at least is aligned with the creative process, right? Yeah. The ads
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:17.200]   are extraordinary. We were listening to them in Italy. I'm like, play that one again. I love the
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.560]   way the guy who says the word shilajit. He says shilajit or something like that. But I can't do
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:26.400]   the accent, folks. Don't take what I just said as evidence of what the ads are like.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:31.440]   Australian accent, that guy. Shilajit. And the chimes in the background, it's so good.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:41.200]   You don't drink alcohol, correct? Correct. Have you ever had a sip of alcohol? I had,
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:50.800]   I drank alcohol once as part of a class experiment and had to mix all these drinks and taste them.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:59.120]   And it was a terrible experience, but it was, it was a requirement in the class I was taking.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:03.120]   Wow. School was different back then where that school was different. I think school
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:06.720]   was different. We used to prick our fingers and do our own blood tests in science class.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.040]   I never did it because I was always needle phobic,
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.240]   but that was definitely something that was asked of us to do.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.600]   Yeah. You could never get away with that now in the high school classroom.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:20.480]   The reason I ask about alcohol is first of all, I'm not the anti-alcohol crusader,
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:24.160]   even though I did an episode about alcohol, which discouraged many people from drinking more of it.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:33.760]   But I think for a lot of people, the idea of smoking cannabis, drinking alcohol
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:38.320]   for them in their mind is synonymous with the creative process, especially music
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:46.480]   for a lot of reasons that people can imagine. I think it's remarkable and impressive
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.760]   and worth spending a few moments with you sharing with us, you know, how is it that you were around
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:59.760]   all of that? You're clearly part of the, part of the crew, meaning you're part of the creative
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:06.560]   process. Presumably people offered you alcohol, drugs, et cetera, but something in you seems like
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:12.480]   resistant to any kind of peer pressure. And, and as an adult, that's impressive, but to think like,
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:17.920]   you know, like when I was 15, 16, sure, you know, I sort of regret it, but yeah, I drank, I
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:26.320]   had my experiences and then eventually stopped that. But most people are not good at like not
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:31.760]   drinking if they don't want to drink ever, or just once from a high school class. What,
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:39.840]   what was the internal narrative in your mind when that stuff was around and what allowed you to just
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.800]   say, no, I'm going to, I belong here, but I'm not going to do that.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:50.560]   It just was never interesting to me. And I think maybe it had to do with being an only child. I'd
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:57.280]   never being an only child, I think made me less resistant to peer pressure because I felt more
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:07.360]   confident in who I was, whatever that was. Just from being with my being with myself and not with
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:12.880]   other siblings, I'm guessing, I don't know if that's right, but that's my first, my first
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:18.960]   inclination is to guess that would be the case. Also, I've always known what I like and known
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.760]   what I don't like and know there are things I want to try. There are things I don't want to try. And
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:28.480]   I feel very good about not doing something I don't want to do. I feel great about it.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:32.400]   Have you ever been curious about psychedelics given that?
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:37.040]   I'm very curious. I've never done it, but I'm very curious. And I've been curious for a long time.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.960]   There may be a time when I experiment.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:43.520]   Yeah, there are two psychedelics in particular that I find really interesting. One is
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:46.880]   macro-dose psilocybin, which I've done as part of a clinical trial.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:52.160]   And my understanding is it reveals in a very intense and experiential way,
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:56.640]   some component of the unconscious mind. And it allows for plasticity and rewiring
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:03.280]   of the brain that's permanent if you come to some understanding through the so-called integration.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:06.800]   It's not without its risks. The other one that's really interesting that I've been hearing more
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:12.880]   about, and I have not tried, and it carries some dangers is ibogaine, which is 22 hours long.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:19.360]   And people experience the world as normal with their eyes open, but when they close their eyes,
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:24.960]   they get a like high resolution movie-like version of prior experiences, but they have
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:29.920]   agency within those movies. They can reshape their reactions. This is being used to treat PTSD in
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:39.040]   veterans to great success. It has some cardiac risk associated with it. So, and it's not legal
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:44.000]   in the United States and it's not being explored in clinical trials yet, but the state of Kentucky
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   recently took, I think it's $40 million from the oxycontin settlement and it's putting it to
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.760]   ibogaine research. Interesting. Yeah. So those are the two that kind of spring to mind, you know,
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:01.920]   kind of the classic psychedelic experience. I've also heard good things about MDMA,
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:06.960]   but I've never done that. Yeah. I have done MDMA as part, again, as part of a therapeutic trial.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:18.160]   It's a strong empathogen. The danger with MDMA, I think, is that if you don't stay in the eye mask
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:24.560]   or if you're listening to music or something, you can easily get anchored to some external
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:28.960]   cue and like see a plant and be like, I love plants and spend the whole four to six hours
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.520]   thinking about your love of plants, which might be valuable. But I think the strong introspective
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:39.280]   work is best done with a therapist there and you and the eye mask and occasionally leaving the eye
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:44.320]   mask and writing things down. So, you know, the reason I put that detail in there is that
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:52.720]   the psychedelic experience is very different with eyes open versus in the eye mask with a clinician
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:59.600]   there versus recreationally. And it's not just about dangers versus safety. It's also about
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.640]   like, it's a big investment and what one stands to get out of it, I think depends on how much
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:11.520]   introspection you're willing to do. We won't be doing it this afternoon. There were at least
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:21.280]   a thousand questions about attention deficit and neuroticism. People who feel like they can't
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:25.200]   organize themselves. And I thought a lot about these questions and tried to distill them into
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:32.880]   a single question. And eventually I did. And it's this for many people, they associate the creative
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:39.840]   process with disorganization. I think what's so striking about you is that you embody both
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:48.880]   the creative process, but also a strong sense of organization around it. Like nothing seems
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:36:00.080]   harebrained or like random or haphazard about anything that you do. And yet for a lot of people
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:04.000]   who call themselves creatives, they'll say, I'm a creative and this, that, and you'll look at the
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.680]   space they're in and it's like chaos or they, or their life is kind of chaos. Not all of them, but
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:15.680]   is what I'm saying making sense? Cause I think why people orient toward you. And one of the
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:22.560]   reasons for your success with the creative process is that you're extremely organized,
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:29.440]   but not to the point of being rigid. Be willing to embellish a little bit on that perception,
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.640]   whether or not it's accurate, inaccurate. I would say there's a part in the process early on
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:45.040]   where it is before it can get organized where it's free and it's playful and it can be chaotic.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:54.240]   It's just not the, it's a by-product of whatever's happening. It's not, it's good because
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:00.000]   it's chaotic and it's, it just happens to be sometimes chaotic in that, in that experiment,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:07.200]   in the beginning where we're really playing with this idea of, of having fun and creating
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.440]   stimulation and seeing how it makes us feel. And we try a lot of, we could try wacky things
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.040]   to get there. But then when it happens, when you get that, that feeling of like, oh, this
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:28.320]   is interesting. I haven't seen this before. Then it gets more controlled, but it starts in a very
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:35.200]   free place. And I don't know if I would really use the word chaotic, but it could be. It certainly
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:44.720]   wouldn't be wrong. I would say more free would be the word. Free. Like no, no expectation
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:55.760]   and total immersion in like an improvisation that you're participating in that can go wherever
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:02.000]   it wants to go. And you're cool allowing it to go wherever it wants to go. And sometimes when
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.280]   it goes somewhere dangerous, that's when it gets interesting. So the, the, I can understand that,
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.760]   that danger aspect, maybe that's why I like pro wrestling. I don't know. But there's something
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:19.840]   about when you get to this, these edges where this is not for everybody, it can get very interesting.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:27.760]   Speaking of stuff that's not for everybody and that to some people might've been shocking. I
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:33.360]   remember hearing ghetto boys for the first time and like, whoa, like they're taking certain things
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:41.040]   pretty far when you're working with an artist and they venture out into that place where things are
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:48.800]   like, maybe even a little shocking. What does that feeling for you internally? Like, is it,
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:53.200]   how do you distinguish between shock value for its own sake and something that's really
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:39:00.080]   opening up a new creative avenue or insight? Like, like how do you, do you recall the first time you,
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:05.840]   you heard like Bushwick and those guys do their thing? What was your internal narrative?
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:12.480]   I can't believe it. I can't believe what they're saying. It's really pushing the boundaries of what
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:19.440]   anyone has said in this music before it had switched because the, the original in originally
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:27.520]   in rap, there was a lot of boasting about themselves bragging. And then we got to the
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:33.840]   message happened and there was some social commentary. Then there was gangster rap.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:42.880]   And then the ghetto boys took a version of gangster rap and turned it into horror rap, which was
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:54.960]   much more graphic than gangster rap. Gangster rap was talking about a, a real life situation
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:02.720]   whereas the ghetto boys took it into horror movie territory. It was more fantasy.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:09.760]   But it seemed really scary at the time in the way that you're scared at a great horror movie.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.680]   Do you like horror movies? I don't. Do you like monster movies where you know,
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:20.720]   it's not real, like it's impossible as opposed to horror movies where, you know,
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:27.120]   it's you know, people getting killed by another human, like stuff that could happen in the world
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:34.640]   versus you know, monsters and zombies and that kind of thing. I don't think I really like either
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.600]   of them very much. I like things that make me feel good. I don't really like adrenaline. You know,
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:47.360]   I don't like to be excited. For some reason in audio, I like something that makes me excited,
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.960]   but in visuals, I tend not to like things that make me excited.
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:58.720]   Interesting. And you're able to kind of clean yourself of experiences easily, right? Like it
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.640]   seems like if you listen to something that's really shocking, you don't carry that shock to
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:08.560]   your sleep or to the next day. Like it doesn't trouble you. But a movie can, can impact me. Like
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.360]   there was a movie called Melancholia that I saw years ago, Lars von Trier movie. And I thought
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:19.440]   it was a very beautiful movie, but I was in a bad mood. I would say for three months from the time I
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:26.000]   watched that movie on, it just like did something to my brain that didn't feel good and it couldn't
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.800]   snap out of it. It's interesting. There, there are a few movies that have done that to me,
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:38.480]   the movie Blue Valentine, which has done really well, which is with Ryan Gosling and someone
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.680]   else where it's a relationship. I won't explain what happens in the arc of the relationship,
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:49.200]   but it just like the movie haunted me. There's one scene where he's wearing a misfit shirt and I was
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:54.480]   like, ah, like, and that's a particularly good scene where he's singing to her. But the rest
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:00.400]   of the movie just brings about such feelings of like, just how hard life can be sometimes
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:06.320]   and how misguided people can be in relationship. And it it's interesting how movies can just kind
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.240]   of embed in us. It's not pleasant. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:18.480]   There were a number of questions asking about how you consume information in the world related to
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:23.520]   what's happening in the world. Like where do you get your news from? You and I talk about this a
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:30.880]   lot. How do we know what to trust these days? Did, should we have ever trusted the news or is it less
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:34.560]   trustworthy now? Like where do you get your information about what's happening in the world
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:41.440]   and stay abreast of like world affairs? I honestly, I don't feel like I know anything about it. You
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:52.640]   know, I I tend to look at it all like wrestling. So if the story's good, I might be more interested
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:43:00.640]   in the story, but I still don't hold much belief that that story is true. Yeah. I don't know what
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:08.880]   to believe anymore. I was asked to comment on a particularly well-known person who's not considered
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:17.440]   very savory by a couple of news avenues in the last couple of years. And I don't know how people
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.800]   had in mind that I would have knowledge about this person. And, and I gave zero information to these
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:28.880]   news outlets. And nonetheless, they, they, they didn't publish quotes from me, but they, they
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:33.920]   publish things that I know to be completely false and they know to be completely false. So I was
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.440]   just struck by the fact that like in scientific publishing, that would get you, you'd lose your
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.920]   job forever. Well, at one point in time, you would have lost your job. Now. I don't know if that's
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:47.760]   true. If you lose your job. Cause we see it happening a lot, right? Yeah. It's wild. Have
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:54.960]   you ever read anything about you? That's not true. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. So based on that,
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:00.720]   absolutely. I mean, some of it is playful stuff like on Reddit and now they've flagged us as
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:04.400]   play. They have a little flag that they can put as, you know, comedic or something, but,
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:10.640]   Oh, sure. I mean, things not just taken out of context, but things like completely wrong.
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:14.000]   Like just like that. I don't, I don't even know where people get this stuff from. I keep waiting
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.680]   for the thing that I'm going to see that says that I'm dead now, but that'll be the moment.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:23.360]   So based on that experience, why would you believe anything you read about anyone else? You, you,
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:30.000]   you get to see firsthand that there are just stories, just not true. And presumably you've
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.880]   seen things written about you that are not true. Absolutely. Right. Absolutely. Right. And artists,
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:39.760]   I know friends of mine, they write things about them. I know it's not true. Wild.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:48.400]   What do you think about the state of play and is the experience of being a parent and having a
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.760]   young child, has that allowed you more opportunities for play and to see through the world through
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:45:04.560]   childlike lenses in a greater capacity, or is it, you know, just separate from your creative process?
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:14.320]   I would say I'm fairly childlike all the time. I try to stay as a open, the beauty of childhood
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:21.840]   is that you don't know, you haven't been indoctrinated yet.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:29.920]   So you, you see things and you have wonder about them. And it's a great feeling, that feeling of
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:36.240]   wonder. And now when someone, I'll tell you a story. This is a true story. My friend Owen came
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:43.680]   over one night in the middle of the night and he had just seen luminescence in the water for the
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:49.040]   first time. And he had, didn't know what, what it was and thought he was having a mystical experience.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:54.400]   And he was so excited. He's like, you won't believe what happened. The, the waves were like,
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.200]   there was light everywhere. It was so cool. I'd never saw anything like it. And I said, oh yeah,
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:06.080]   that's a luminescence. And I explained what it was and it destroyed the magic for him.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:14.720]   He was really having a childlike magical experience. And I destroyed it by
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:21.840]   telling him the science behind it. I try to live in a world where I can experience
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:29.760]   what he experiences and I don't let the story ruin what's, I allow the possibility
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:39.600]   to go past what I'm told the story is, but that things can be even wilder than the rational
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:48.400]   explanation. For me, learning the reductionist science behind something to me adds depth and
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:54.320]   beauty. But then again, I realize I'm sort of, I've been indoctrinated into the field of science.
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.680]   So the matrix, they call it the matrix. This is one I didn't understand, but I'm going to assume
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:04.000]   that you understand because it has to do with people you've worked with. If Rick had casually
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.160]   dropped that the Ramones named themselves after the fake last name Paul McCartney used to check
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:13.520]   into hotels during Beatlemania, would that have blown Andrew's mind? That's a kind of weird
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:18.480]   question. I guess the question is, is it true that the Ramones named themselves after the fake last
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:24.000]   name that Paul McCartney used to check into hotels during Beatlemania? I don't know that, I don't know
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:31.040]   if that's a true story. I do know that Paul McCartney used the name Paul Ramone when checking
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:37.440]   into hotels, but I don't know if that's where the Ramones got the name. Got it. And here is how
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:44.000]   rumors turn into quote unquote facts on the internet. And also maybe the Paul Ramone story
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.920]   is not true either, but that's story I've heard. Right. That reminds me, and I think this is an
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.560]   important case in point that there's a, what I consider a very famous photograph of you,
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:00.720]   Johnny Cash, Joe Strummer, and Henry Rollins. You're wearing a Dead Kennedy shirt. The four of
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:08.240]   you are facing one another. And I love that photograph because of who's in it. And I remember
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:16.000]   hearing a rare track from Strummer and the Mescaleros called On the Road to Rock and Roll.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.840]   And then for some reason, probably because my phone is tapped into my brain,
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:31.840]   I was served up a video on social media of Henry Rollins telling the story of that gathering of
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:38.320]   the four of you where Rollins is describing the story of Joe Strummer leaning into
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:44.320]   Johnny Cash and saying, hey, I wrote a song for you. It goes on the road to rock. Okay.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.040]   And I remember coming to you and saying, Rick, guess what? Remember that photo? You're like,
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.520]   I remember the photo. I said, yeah, Rollins has the story of what was happening in that moment.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:49:00.560]   And I was so excited. And you said, you said, yeah, I don't remember that. It might be true.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:01.280]   It might be true.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:06.480]   But it might be entirely made up also. And we're not calling Henry a liar, but Henry, I believe.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.920]   I believe Henry remembers that story. And that was his experience. That was not my experience,
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.640]   or I don't remember it being my experience, but who knows? Anything could have been said.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:25.280]   It's true. Anything could have been said. It had as much to do, the fact that I don't remember has
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:30.320]   as much to do with whatever I was thinking about when that happened. And the story that Henry told
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:35.440]   had as much to do with what was going on in Henry's head when it happened. We have no idea.
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.720]   We have no idea.
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:40.560]   Do you remember somebody shooting the photograph?
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:41.280]   I do not.
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:44.880]   I'll put a link to that photograph on the internet. It's a really incredible gathering of-
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:47.200]   I've seen the photo, but I don't remember it being shot.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:50.400]   I'm looking for a high resolution version of that photo. If anyone can find me one,
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.640]   I'll be happy to compensate you well.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:50:00.720]   There were a lot of questions about your daily routine. People love this. The morning routine,
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:07.920]   the daily routine. And while I have to believe that everybody's necessary routine is
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:12.320]   quite different from the next, if you wouldn't mind just giving us a sense of
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:15.440]   like the first couple hours of your day, what that typically looks like when you're
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.280]   like not traveling and you're settled into a place.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:26.640]   It's different depending on the place that I'm in, but typically it involves waking up,
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:37.440]   going out into the sun as naked as possible to start the day. I try to wake up slowly.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:47.040]   And probably within an hour of that, I'll leave the house and go for as long of a beach walk as
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:51.680]   possible. Or if I'm in a place where there's a gym several days a week, I'll go to the gym instead.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:58.160]   But I'll do some activity, I would say about an hour after waking up. Sometimes it's an hour
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:04.160]   and a half. Sometimes it's less. Depending on the place I'm at, I also might do stretching before
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:13.040]   I go on the walk and do just several stretches on yoga mats on the floor or with foam rollers
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:21.840]   or balls or some different things. I don't start my day until those things are out of the way.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:30.560]   I try to avoid any work-related anything. Now that said, if a thought comes up
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:37.520]   that I'm excited about, I'll note it. I won't avoid thoughts, but I tend not to engage in any
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:47.520]   work until probably 11 o'clock. 11 a.m. would be the soonest. And some days not until one o'clock.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:58.800]   And then I do focused work until maybe six. And then I spend the rest of the night
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:06.640]   trying to wind down out of work mode.
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:12.720]   So 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. are really the peak quote-unquote work hours.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:18.160]   Could be 11 too. Like today we started here at 11 and that felt like I'd be good by 11. And I
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:24.640]   already did my morning walk. I had the argument on the beach. I was in the sun. I was in the hot tub.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:31.040]   I had a whole morning already. And then what does your evening wind down look like
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:38.720]   in terms of the space that you're in or trying to create and your internal landscape? Well, it's
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:45.120]   only red light. I'm usually wearing, from the time the sun sets, I'm wearing red glasses.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:54.320]   I'm in a space with only red light. I'm 99% of the time home with my family.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:53:04.080]   And we talk. I might watch a wrestling or a documentary with red glasses on.
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:12.800]   We eat dinner together or we eat dinner in shifts depending on how it's working. But we're all
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:22.000]   we're all together. And I find something to occupy my mind that gets me out of the work day.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.720]   That said, sometimes the ideas still flow and I'll note them. But I avoid, I avoid any kind of a
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:36.960]   work phone call or anything that's stimulating or that will get me thinking about it.
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:47.840]   I aim for sunset. And then I'm usually in bed. I'm usually in bed by 10.
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:56.880]   And I fall asleep within 15 minutes. Your relationship to light is fascinating.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:01.600]   The sunlight piece makes a lot of sense and will make sense to the listeners of this podcast.
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:08.320]   We haven't done too many episodes, but we will do more that covers the trying to avoid
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:14.960]   bright light exposure in the evening. You're wearing the red lens glasses now, even though
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:18.240]   it's the middle of the day. That's because we've got these bright lights around us, correct?
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:21.040]   Yeah. And have you found that
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.440]   limiting your bright artificial light exposure in the evening has benefited you and in what ways?
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:32.720]   Absolutely. And once you've done it, once you've changed and avoid like looking at screens or my,
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:38.960]   you know, my phone turns red at night. When I see someone else's phone, if someone comes to visit
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:50.880]   and their phone lights up at night, it's blinding. And it's so disturbing. And for them,
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:58.160]   that's normal. They're in this heightened, blown out place all the time. I'm staying at neutral.
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:08.080]   I'm staying at the more natural, how the world would be if man didn't create all of these
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:18.400]   loud things, loud, loud, loud devices. Yeah. I've switched my phone thanks to your input.
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:25.360]   And we will have released a clip on this by 10. This episode airs on the triple click approach
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:31.440]   to the phone that you can put in very easily to allow it to go from regular screen to red screen
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.520]   at night so that you don't have to go into the settings each time you just triple click.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.600]   We'll provide a link to that explanation. And Rick taught me that when I was over in Italy,
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:46.720]   everyone in his home turned to me and said, wait, your phone is so bright. You got to do the red
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:50.880]   light thing. I said, I don't know how. And he taught me that. So it's a very useful trick.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:55.760]   Have you noticed a difference since looking at huge positive difference?
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:00.560]   I sleep better. There are great data now because of course I go then find the data that, you know,
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:04.080]   for shift workers, people that have to be up at night working, if they put them under red light,
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:11.600]   the amount of cortisol at that time is suppressed, which is great as compared to when they're under
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:18.240]   bright artificial lights without red lens glasses or they're in red lights. It's far,
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.440]   far more beneficial, less cortisol. You want cortisol high early in the day,
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:26.400]   viewing sunlight early in the day, increase it by at least 50%. Then you want it to taper off
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:33.360]   and on and on. I heard something recently, which is going to make a lot of sense.
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:37.520]   One thing that's happened in the last 30 years, which may at least partially explain the obesity
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:46.960]   crisis is that calories, which are depleted of nutrients, micronutrients are very cheap now.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:54.080]   They're very cheap to get calories, but they aren't nutritious calories. In addition,
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:57:00.640]   there's been a change in lighting technology so that blue light photons are very cheap. Like when
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:04.640]   I was a kid, they, my parents would say, turn off the lights. It's costing us all this money. Now
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:10.000]   it's very cheap to keep the lights on in a home. The heat is a different story, but with respect.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:16.960]   So we have a lot of cheap photons. So I think of blue light as cheap photons, not the good for you
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:22.160]   photons, not nourishing photons and consuming calories too often or at the wrong times of day,
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:27.200]   we know is bad for you consuming photons in the wrong form at the wrong time of day, bad for you.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:32.880]   And I think those two things combined plus all the downstream negative cascades can largely explain
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.680]   the obesity and in some sense, mental health crisis. Interesting. Yeah. So just to there,
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:41.440]   I editorialized again, I realized that we're trying to shift the ratio to more Rick, less
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:46.320]   Andrew, but he can't help himself. He can't help himself. And Rick indulges me. So actually there
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.080]   were a number of questions in here that asked me, you know, how has Rick helped you? And I'm
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:54.800]   refraining from answering those because this is people want your answers for them, but I do all
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:58.560]   the things that Rick's referring to. I'm not wearing red lens glasses now, but I have changed
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:05.200]   a lot of my health practices and or sought out science to test whether or not some of the things
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:08.800]   that you've been doing for awhile makes sense. And indeed in every case, they've made sense.
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:12.560]   I'm not just saying that because, because you're here, but you and I do a lot of the same thing.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.880]   We're interested. And if it didn't work, we'd probably stop doing it eventually.
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:23.040]   Right. It's like we're testing. Right. Right. And I do believe that what starts out as crazy,
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:28.480]   like Mike Mentzer stuff of low volume weight training with heavy weights, it works so much
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:32.560]   better than the high volumes. All that stuff is being shown to be true in these peer reviewed
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:38.000]   trials. So, you know, that's the nature of science. It often comes, science often follows
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:45.920]   the practitioners by many decades. You know, it doesn't get there first because it's a slower,
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:50.560]   more iterative process, but some people need to see those clinical trials to feel comfortable
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:56.560]   doing something. I think the creative process is uniquely separated from academic science and
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:01.120]   academic scholarship in a way that I think has really benefited it. I mean, can you imagine
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.520]   if the ghetto boys had to get a degree in music theory in order to do what they do?
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:07.920]   They wouldn't be the ghetto boys. Right. Or Slayer.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:11.680]   They would not be Slayer. Yeah. Or Public Enemy.
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:12.960]   Yes. Or Adele.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:14.080]   Yes. Or Eminem.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:20.000]   Right. It's, it's almost by virtue of the fact that there is no degree for that per se, that
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:24.960]   allowed them to do what they did. Right. Yeah. Absolutely.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:29.280]   So what are your thoughts on schooling in higher education or just education? I mean,
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:33.040]   you were at NYU when you launched your record label, you graduated NYU.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:39.040]   I did. What are your thoughts on getting a quote unquote formal education?
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:45.680]   It seems like an obsolete idea. I think maybe there was a time where it would have been helpful.
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:55.040]   And maybe depending on if the thing that you want to study can only be learned in an institution,
[01:59:55.040 --> 02:00:02.560]   maybe it would make sense. But I think the real world, getting an internship or
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:10.560]   finding the right mentor and going into whatever the thing is that you're interested in learning
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:18.240]   about, learning from people who do it as opposed to the system, I think,
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:22.240]   I think might be a more, a better use of your time.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:31.360]   The creative process doesn't exist in a vacuum and relationships are a huge part of life.
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:34.960]   One thing that I've heard you say, and that certainly I've been working to internalize
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:41.760]   is this idea that whatever relationships one has in their life, romantic relationships are not
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:50.400]   married or not, kids are not, that the ideal circumstance is where one's work is the most
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:53.840]   stressful part of their life. Can you tell us more about that?
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:01:04.240]   Yeah. The home is the safe place from which you can go out and be a warrior and do all
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:13.200]   these great things and these crazy things. I'm fearless when it comes to art. I'm not
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:21.760]   fearless when it comes to life. Life is my relationships. Art is where we can do these
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:34.480]   crazy things and have fun and try extreme things and see what happens. That's a safe
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:43.200]   place to do that because it's just expression. It's not the things we make don't have to
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:49.440]   represent who we are. They're just the things we make. That's a point of view. It's like,
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:54.480]   this is interesting to me in this moment. Check it out. That's all it is. May have a completely
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:02:01.120]   different feeling tomorrow. Whereas in a relationship, it's long-term, hopefully.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:07.280]   And it's as long-term as it's a productive relationship where everybody is getting what
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.240]   they want from that relationship. Everybody's needs are being met and everybody cares enough to
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:20.240]   meet each other's needs. I've always admired how rational you are about relationships and this
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:27.040]   notion that if everybody isn't being honest, there's no relationship actually. Not it's a
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:33.280]   bad relationship, but there's actually no relationship. No, because if someone's not
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:42.400]   telling the truth, then each person is experiencing a different understanding of the world.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:49.200]   You're living in two different worlds. So they're never actually together
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:55.200]   when you're experiencing a different world. So unless you can, you don't have to agree.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:00.560]   I'm not saying you have to agree on everything, but you have to be truthful in saying,
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:08.000]   this is how I see it. And your partner is clear in, yes, this is how I see it or no,
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:16.000]   this is how I see it. You're on the same page, even in disagreement, but it's real.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:26.560]   Each of you are being who you are for and with the other. But if you're not opening yourself up
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:33.200]   in that way to your partner, you're in a different world. They have an idea of what's happening
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:37.600]   that's completely different than what you have an idea of what's happening. That's not what you
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:41.040]   that's not, that's not being together. No masks.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:51.440]   No, no. It's the, it's the same as when you said earlier about lying in your diary.
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:59.040]   You'd only be doing a disservice to yourself. Lying in a relationship would only be doing
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:05.040]   a disservice to yourself. Mike Ness of Social Distortion has a song
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:10.400]   called Cheating at Solitaire, which seems like an appropriate title to mention right now.
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.080]   Lying in the diary, cheating at solitaire. Yeah. It's ridiculous.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:17.760]   Doesn't make any sense. No, you're not, you're not actually playing the game.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:21.680]   Do you know what I mean? If you're cheating at it, you're not actually playing the game.
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.080]   The whole point of the game is the game. If you cheat at it, you're not playing the game.
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:36.080]   Do you have any must read books for people? I'll throw one out. Rick's book on the creative act,
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:47.200]   A Way of Being. But in addition to that book, what are some books that you recommend to people for
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:52.960]   stimulating thoughts or for, I don't know, health purposes or things that you found particularly
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:56.560]   beneficial in book form? My favorite book about meditation
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:03.280]   is called Wherever You Go, There You Are. And I just got sent the 30th anniversary edition,
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:09.200]   which is completely rewritten. I have not yet read the rewritten version, but I love the original
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:14.240]   version and I know the rewritten version. I'm guessing that the rewritten version is just more
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:19.440]   refined and even better. Such a great book. That book was given to me when I was about 14 and a
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:29.520]   half when I was released from a particularly uncomfortable non-voluntary state of affairs.
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:34.320]   And one of the things that I remember about that book that helped me through so many years of life,
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:37.760]   and I have to go back to, is this mountain visualization meditation.
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:42.240]   Being a mountain. I don't know why it was so helpful,
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:47.360]   but goodness, was it helpful for me. It's a beautiful idea. It's a beautiful idea.
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:51.520]   Yeah. I don't know why I thought of that just now, but I'm going to go back and read it.
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:06:04.240]   Do you think that there's genetic, epigenetic, family lineage stuff unrelated to genetics that
[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:14.240]   leads us to create things that are really about like our ancestors? For instance, is it possible
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:22.720]   that let's take Johnny Cash for instance, or an artist that you've worked with more recently,
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:31.840]   Chili Peppers, that when they got together to make music, that something from Anthony's family line
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:39.520]   was being transmuted through him into the songs. Is that happening? Do you think that we can work
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:45.840]   out and include things that are generations far back enough that we don't even really know what
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:49.120]   happened to them? I mean, it's coming through in our genes. I think it's certainly possible,
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:55.040]   but I don't think we can know. And I don't think it's necessarily even helpful to know.
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:03.360]   It just is one of those mysterious things. I don't think we know why we do many of the things we do.
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:09.680]   And it's just another example of that. And that's a possible theory to explain why we do the things
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:15.280]   we do maybe, but there may be another one. It may be UFOs are controlling us. I don't know. Do you
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:20.640]   know what I'm saying? It could be anything. - There are people on the internet that thinks
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:25.440]   it's UFOs that are controlling us. - I wouldn't disagree with that.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:31.360]   - More and more evidence is coming out that unidentified flying objects might
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:38.560]   actually be a documented phenomenon by the US government. I haven't looked into it yet, but-
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:42.880]   - I wouldn't be surprised. - When you were on this podcast before
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:49.600]   and on several other podcasts, you mentioned that you don't play music, at least not routinely. You
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:55.920]   don't play an instrument, that you have limited knowledge of how a soundboard works. So when you're
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:02.560]   listening to artists, are you listening for something or you're staying open for something
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:07.760]   that you might hear, that will trigger a certain state in you that you recognize?
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:17.840]   - I'm open to just see what's happening. I listen and recognize, is this making me lean forward?
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:23.200]   Am I curious to see what's gonna happen next? Is the thing that happens next different than
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:28.000]   what I thought was gonna happen next? That could be interesting. I listen to a lot of music when
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:32.000]   it doesn't do what's expected. That's really interesting, especially if it sounds good,
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:42.320]   if it works. So I'm just open to experiencing what it is. And I'll say something funny about it,
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:48.000]   which is this will sound mystical. I don't understand it. But often you can tell a lot
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:54.640]   about the piece of music you're gonna listen to based on the first sound you hear, like the first
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:09:05.120]   moment. It's not about what note it is. It's not about what instrument it is. It's
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:15.200]   intention in the performance. And that performance could even be a machine.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:24.240]   The way when something starts, sometimes there's this feeling of, oh, this is gonna be good,
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:28.800]   just out of the boom, the downbeat. Can't explain it.
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:39.440]   - It reminds me of dating. And you know within half a nanosecond, this is gonna be a fun night,
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:47.920]   to be an interesting night. This person's interesting. Or, okay, this is not a night
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:53.760]   to continue, right? I don't know. And it's not what's said necessarily or even how it's said,
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:10:00.320]   just it's a feeling. - I know that depending on how I'm feeling,
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:08.640]   I'll avoid listening critically to something if I'm not feeling well. If I don't feel like I can be
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:21.840]   completely there and open, I'll not listen. I know I wanna really be there for the thing that I'm
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:26.720]   listening to. - Do you inform people if like,
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:29.200]   hey, I'm not here today, like I can't- - Sometimes.
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:30.320]   - Yeah. - Sometimes.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:35.680]   - As somebody who has never been part of the music production process,
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:41.440]   how long does it take, like for an album, like let's throw out an artist you've worked with,
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:46.240]   like you worked with Eminem. How long did that? Oh, you did some songs on that album
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:47.520]   or the whole album? - I did some songs.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:53.840]   - So did he come in with those written and then you guys worked together on those songs?
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:11:00.240]   How long was that? A week, a month, a day? - I think we were together for several weeks.
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:05.680]   It's been long enough now that I can't remember the specifics, but there is no
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:12.320]   rule of how that works. And sometimes things come together very quickly. An album can be made in a
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:19.040]   weekend and some albums are years in the making. When it's years in the making, it's rarely every
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:27.600]   day for years in the making. It's usually more episodic, but there is something, both versions
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:32.000]   are very interesting and it's something that comes out almost fully formed very quickly,
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.360]   has particular energy. And then something that's made over time
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:46.800]   can have all of those individual moments, all the changes that happen within you over that period
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:55.840]   of time, those can all be reflected and be the difference between a daily diary journal and
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:02.880]   reading three months. It's different. They're two different things. Can't say one's better than the
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:10.320]   other. They're just two different things. So some projects are more like a year's diary and some
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:17.280]   are more like a weekend. And same, you watch a movie, some movies, the movie story takes place
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:23.760]   in 24 hours. And sometimes it's a person's lifetime. One's not a better method than the
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:29.760]   other. It's whatever suits the work. Speaking of your work with Eminem, but also with
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:37.760]   Jay-Z and with Beastie Boys and others, you are featured in a number of the videos.
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:42.880]   You show up in those videos. Whose decision was that? And what are your thoughts on music videos?
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:47.680]   I remember when music videos first came out, the whole MTV era and just thinking like, this is so
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:53.760]   cool. I can see the artists, see how they're dressed. I love the crazy styles and all of that
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:13:00.720]   that accompany the music. Two questions. One, whose decision was it to be in the videos?
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:04.400]   Because producers often are not included in the videos.
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:07.760]   It would always be if the artists asked. They'd be the only reason I would be there.
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:13.440]   And two, what are your thoughts on music videos and the idea that then it puts a very strong
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:19.280]   visual to the song, whereas where they're not to be a video, people could just imagine something
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:25.840]   based on what they're hearing and hearing alone. They're two different things. There's not a better
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:33.680]   or worse. There's sometimes where the video makes the song better. And there's often the case where
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:43.280]   the poetry of the words, if you close your eyes and listen to what the words are, as a listener,
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:52.800]   you get to participate in that, in creating that world in your head. So sometimes photographs can
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:59.440]   tell us too much information. It's too leading. It limits the story to just this photograph.
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:06.720]   The photograph tells you much more than the words. The words can be interpreted in many ways,
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:12.000]   and then we each get to have that experience. It's something in the book that I was
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:21.600]   cognizant of in picking the words was never to be specific to the point of where the reader
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:28.720]   doesn't get to participate in this act. So it doesn't tell you what to think. It's an
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:37.600]   invitation to think. It's an invitation to say, "Where am I in this? What's my version of this?"
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:46.720]   It's not about anyone else. It's about the reader. From the beginning, that was always
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:52.880]   part of my understanding of what I thought would be the most helpful.
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:15:00.160]   The cover certainly embodies that, that it's not clear exactly what the cover design is
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:03.680]   quote unquote supposed to be. It's open to interpretation.
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:06.640]   Interpret it as you wish, and different people see different things.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:13.840]   Let's get current. What are you working on now that you're excited about if you can share?
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:16.640]   Let me see what I can and can't share.
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:19.600]   Could be broad categories of things too.
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:26.400]   I'm working on a couple of documentary projects that I'm excited about,
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:35.360]   and some albums that I've been working on over time are coming out. One is an incredible singer,
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:41.840]   guitar player named Marcus King. His album's about to come out. The Gossip is a band that I made an
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:48.080]   album with 10 years ago, and we just made a new album, or we made an album maybe 18 months ago,
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:54.080]   and that's coming out now. Those are the first ones that come to mind.
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:59.760]   Is the documentary process fun for you, and how do you approach that?
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:05.920]   I watch a lot of documentaries to learn what I don't want to do.
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:12.480]   I don't think I've been inspired. Well, maybe some cases where I get inspired by what I'm seeing,
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:17.600]   but more often I see things and I say, "Okay, these documentaries all have this format,
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:27.120]   so I know I don't want it to be this format." It's more of a ruling out, and it's fun to find new ways
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:35.520]   that reveal different information than the standard format allows.
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:39.520]   It's interesting to me. We'll see if anyone else cares.
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:46.240]   You have a unique approach to podcasting. First of all, what are your criteria for who you invite on
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:53.040]   as a guest? Second, what do you have in mind when you sit down and podcast?
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:58.480]   I have some ideas about how you're going to answer, but I think it's important that
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:04.240]   I not inject. I think people are interested in this even if they don't want a podcast because
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:08.320]   I think it gets to the process of something that you're doing now and how you're doing it now.
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:15.760]   Yeah. I didn't set out to do what I'm about to tell you. I didn't set out to do this,
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:21.280]   but it's something that after I started doing it, I came to realize it's an interesting thing.
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:29.200]   I actually learned this from listening to your podcast. It was actually Lex's podcast with you.
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.920]   I was listening to the podcast, and I know you know Lex, and I know you guys are friends.
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:43.040]   Both of you, in addition to you talking to Lex, you're talking to the audience. Lex,
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:49.360]   in addition to talking to you, talks to the audience. The audience was a participant
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:58.480]   in your conversation. I realized that at the Tetragrammaton podcast, it's different than that.
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:05.760]   It's more of an intimate, personal, like the interview with you that hasn't come out yet.
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:15.920]   That was me talking to you. I certainly didn't have any idea that anybody else was going to hear
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:21.040]   it other than yes, someone else is going to hear it, but that's not what this is. I was asking you
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:26.400]   the questions I was interested in, and I wanted to learn as much as I could. If you said something
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:31.280]   that I didn't understand, I'd ask you to explain it, or if you told me a story about something that
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:36.800]   sent me on a tangent that I want to know more about this left side of what you said or the
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:45.040]   right side of what you said, I would ask, but only following my own interests. It has an intimacy.
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:51.680]   It's turned into, if I listen to a Tetragrammaton podcast, it sounds like I'm overhearing a
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:19:02.560]   conversation, a personal conversation. It has turned into parts of certain decisions we've made,
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:10.880]   like there's music at the beginning, and then you hear the guest more often than not
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:18.640]   is in the middle of a story, and it's almost as if you've walked into a room and people are in this
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:23.360]   deep conversation, and you're just sitting on the side quietly and hearing this conversation,
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:30.000]   and it's a real moment that's happening there, and it's just different. I can't say it's better,
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.440]   can't say it's worse, can't say it. I don't know what's interesting about it,
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:39.360]   but something about it's interesting to me, and when I listen to it, I feel a different kind of an
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:47.520]   intimacy. And again, it wasn't premeditated. This is after the fact I'm looking back and
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:50.800]   understanding, "Oh, this is what it is. This is why this is different."
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:58.480]   Yeah. The podcast that I did with you on your podcast when I was featured as, I guess,
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:03.120]   the second time, I completely forgot that we were podcasting. It was also good we'd had a few days
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:10.560]   together overseas there. We're in a very kind of isolated environment. That helped me get out of
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:16.720]   the mode of there are listeners. Yeah. There's no sense of performance involved.
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:26.000]   It couldn't be more casual. And the reason I chose not to film it is because the nature of
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:33.120]   lights and cameras make it harder to forget that you're doing it.
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:42.640]   So I aim for it to be as natural an experience so that you can have the conversation that you
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:47.360]   really would have if there were no lights and cameras. Not that we want to reveal anything.
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:55.040]   It's just a level of comfort and openness where you're talking to somebody you like and you're
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:21:00.080]   enjoying the conversation. And that's so you. I just have to share that the first time we met
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:05.360]   in person, you and I had FaceTimed a number of times previous to that. But the first time we met
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:11.120]   in person, came over to your house, we ended up doing sauna and cold. And I was going through a
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:16.480]   particularly challenging time in my life. I mean, it had really just hit me square in the face. And
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:21.440]   I remember saying, "Hey, listen, I don't know if we can talk about this," but I just opened up about
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:26.560]   all of it. And that's the moment when we would have become friends anyway, but that's where
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:31.120]   things really took off 'cause I kept apologizing at the end. I said, "I'm so sorry." And you said,
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:38.240]   "No, no, this is actually what we're supposed to do." And I feel very grateful that we've remained
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:45.680]   close friends ever since. And that catalyzed a lot. But I think that one of the things I love
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:53.040]   about podcasts, not just podcasting, but podcasts is that the really effective podcasts like yours,
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:22:00.240]   like Lex's, like Rogan, like Rich Roll, Tim Ferriss, they really reflect the love and passion
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:05.200]   that the person has for that kind of conversation. I mean, I can certainly say this about my podcast.
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:13.520]   I've been learning, organizing, and distributing information since I was six years old.
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:19.600]   So my podcast is just that. You like real conversation and real things that are
[02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:23.600]   unbarriered by the idea that maybe someone's going to listen and how will it work out,
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:26.880]   just like we talked about earlier, and you answered the questions that way.
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:33.440]   And I think Lex likes Lex's form of thing and Joe is doing his form of thing. And I think that's,
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:37.760]   to me, one of the great gifts of podcasting. If anyone wants to know how to create a successful
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:42.560]   podcast, quote unquote successful, it's have the kind of conversations and talk about the kinds of
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:46.960]   things you really love. Like Cameron Haynes has this lift, run, shoot podcast where you go to his
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:52.960]   house, you do a workout, then you go for a run and then he teaches you archery. And the reason it's
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:59.120]   so effective is that he loves lifting, running, and shooting. And then he's honest and he loves
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:03.120]   teaching people that. So at the end of the day, you're sitting down talking about a great day
[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:07.840]   that embodies everything that he's about and the person learned. And like, I couldn't do that
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:12.560]   podcast. I can go on as a guest and I loved being guests, but I think that's the message.
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:16.560]   And it brings us back to what you were talking about earlier and throughout today's discussion.
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:23.040]   Just that if you're thinking about how it's going to land, how the hell could it ever work?
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:28.560]   Yeah. It's just a different thing. I had a conversation yesterday for the podcast with
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:34.000]   Daniel Kaluuya, who I've never met before. Incredible actor and beautiful human being.
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:40.560]   And we probably talked for about three hours and it was a deep conversation. And I feel like I
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:44.720]   might have a new best friend. Like he's unbelievable. The coolest guy. If I wasn't doing the
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:50.560]   podcast, I don't know if I would have met him. It just worked out. It worked out that I got to meet
[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:59.200]   this incredible person. Well, Rick, we covered most of the most frequently asked questions and
[02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:07.120]   you've been extremely gracious with your time and thoughtfulness and answering them. And I don't
[02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:12.400]   know what to say, except thank you for taking the time to do yet another podcast to answer the
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:17.520]   audience's questions. They were here in this podcast in the form of this very large stack
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:26.640]   of questions. And of course, your book includes a lot of information that encapsulates this,
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:32.320]   but I think this really fleshes out some of the details of like how you go about things, how
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:39.120]   certain things can't be the same for everybody. And I think in answering these questions,
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:44.160]   you provided a great service to people who are perhaps still struggling with getting the creative
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:50.560]   process going or flowing. I'm certain that it's going to change the way that I focus and lean
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:54.160]   into my day. I've got a number of different notes here and maybe I'll be willing to share them with
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:58.000]   people, but then that would go against the principle of this is for me and everyone's
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.880]   going to work it out their own way. So we'll provide links to everything that was mentioned
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:08.000]   where there's a link that's relevant. And yeah, man, I would just want to say thank you so much
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:12.400]   for being such an incredible educator and such an incredible friend as well.
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:17.440]   Thank you. It's a funny idea of being an educator. I can't imagine that, but I appreciate the,
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:20.160]   I appreciate those words.
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:23.600]   Well, you are indeed an educator. We're learning so much from you. And,
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:29.280]   and if you just step back for a second and think about all the creative works that have stemmed
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:34.880]   and are going to stem from the learnings that people have achieved from hearing your experience
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:40.720]   and wisdom, it's incalculable. Wow. I'll take it. Thank you, sir.
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:46.320]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion about protocols for creativity with the one and

[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:35.200]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman lab podcast, we discuss supplements while supplements
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:39.680]   aren't necessary for everybody. Many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:43.680]   improving sleep for hormone support and for improving focus. To learn more about the
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:48.560]   supplements discussed on the Huberman lab podcast, go to live momentous spelled OUS.
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:53.760]   So live momentous.com/huberman. If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:27:00.480]   I am Huberman lab on Instagram X, formerly called Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads. And at
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:04.800]   all of those places, I discuss science and science related tools, some of which overlaps with the
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:08.640]   content of the Huberman lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content covered
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:13.440]   on the Huberman lab podcast. So again, it's Huberman lab on all social media channels.

[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:32.240]   where I list out the specific protocols, for instance, for improving dopamine functioning,
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:37.600]   or for improving your sleep, or for deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure or fitness
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:43.120]   protocols, and on and on, all of which are presented in brief fashion, very direct,
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:48.080]   just the protocols listed out again, completely zero cost. To sign up, you simply go to Huberman
