[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Alona asks, "How many hours of sleep do you normally manage to get to your schedule? How do you avoid burning out?"
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.280]   Well first
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.680]   Heaven is
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.280]   nine and a half hours
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.500]   On a day, maybe there's a little bit of rain for some reason even though you live in the city
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.700]   It's quiet an occasional car slowly driving by
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.000]   Heaven is getting those nine and a half. No, heaven is the first cup of coffee after the nine and a half hours of sleep
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.240]   Yeah
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.640]   Optimal performance wise I like to get seven or eight hours of sleep.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.340]   I don't often get that amount of sleep though, and I think the rest is just all mental. I still often pull
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.920]   Nights where it's one, two, three hours of sleep. I frequently pull all-nighters
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.440]   maybe an average of about
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.680]   10 to 15 all-nighters a year
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.120]   All have to do with deadlines and just focus. A few occasional rare beautiful all-nighters are
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.800]   sort of
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.040]   You're so passionate. I'm so passionate about a particular idea. I just can't wait
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.960]   Can't wait to see it work and I stay up all night, you know
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.280]   Through noon in the afternoon and then maybe go to bed early next night, you know
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.720]   Go to bed at like 9 p.m. Or something like that
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.160]   Burnout too. Ah
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.040]   You know what I don't believe in burnout
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.040]   It's not like a I think I think there's just a voice of laziness that can be defeated
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.080]   with
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080]   with a sword of
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.320]   focus, perseverance, determination
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.920]   And passion. I think I love everything I do. I could wash toilets. I could do manual labor anything. I just love it
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.560]   I love every moment of every day the sadness the fear all of that. That's a beautiful part of the journey
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.240]   I love it. So to me burnout doesn't even make sense. Like what are you burning out from?
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   even the concept of burnout is
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.580]   Something that I love so like if you feel like you're burning out
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.800]   That that's beautiful too. That's part of the human experience. I love that whole thing and when you're passionate about everything, what the hell does anything
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:39.200]   Burnout kind of says like I'm I think because I've known close close people to me that have suffered from depression. I
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.880]   think depression is
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.600]   Sort of
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.720]   actually like clinical depression is kind of the experience that I see as
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   beyond
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.420]   The kind of thing that I'm talking about which is it's really you're in a place where nothing is meaning
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.920]   but to me I have never experienced a
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.680]   Moment where something is not rich of meaning and I
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.600]   think David
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.880]   Foster Wallace said, you know, the key to life is
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   To be unboreable
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.220]   Meaning it's impossible to make you bored of anything you do and I'm unboreable of anything
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.240]   I do. I love it. My face might not express it. I got a Russian sort of
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:43.780]   Sad suffering face most of the time but I'm actually happy on the inside. I'm like a like a Kiwi
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.840]   Ugly on the outside
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.880]   Sweet and glorious on the inside again that that's one question. I'm not even answering it correctly. Okay
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   You
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   You
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   You
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   You
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   You
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   You
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   You
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
