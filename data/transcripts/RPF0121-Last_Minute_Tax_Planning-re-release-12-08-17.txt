[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   We're coming up on the end of the year,
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.300]   so let's see if I can save you some money
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.960]   on your tax bill this year.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.620]   If you haven't been thinking about it this year,
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.660]   you might be caught saying, what am I gonna do?
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.880]   And today I'm gonna try to help you solve that problem.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.260]   Good morning, my name is Joshua Sheets
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.500]   and this is the Radical Personal Finance podcast
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.620]   for today, Wednesday, December 17, 2014.
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.980]   And today, let's dig into some tax planning ideas.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.560]   As I mentioned on a previous show,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.060]   this is the time of year that if you pay any attention
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.500]   to the financial websites or if you pay attention
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.400]   to your financial section in your newspaper
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.440]   or if you look at your Facebook newsfeed or whatever,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.260]   you're likely to get some articles showing up
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.340]   that are gonna be essentially
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.420]   end of the year tax planning ideas.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.900]   And that's good, they're useful,
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.080]   and that's what this show today
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.980]   that I'm creating for you is about.
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760]   But the challenge with doing this kind of planning
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.100]   at the end of the year is that it's way too late.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.660]   It's way too late to start talking about
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.460]   what you're gonna actually do for 2014.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.620]   Good tax planning, frankly, you should be working
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.700]   on good tax planning for 2015 right now
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.820]   and getting started with that.
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.700]   Now I know that's nice to say in theory
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.060]   and in practice it's a completely different world,
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.640]   but that is really important that you do it in advance.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.600]   Good planning in advance is always gonna be more effective
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.860]   than last minute planning,
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.700]   but doesn't mean that last minute planning isn't helpful.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.080]   I do wanna keep this in context
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.820]   and that's why I started with the previous show
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.060]   where I didn't focus on how to save taxes,
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.060]   but rather I just focused on end of the year goal planning.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.500]   And so that previous show that if you haven't listened to,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.180]   go back and listen to episode 116,
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.820]   which was the show on how to plan
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.820]   your financial goals for 2015.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.820]   You can find that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/116
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.700]   if you're interested in that show.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.420]   And the reason that I did that is because
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.620]   really more than anything,
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.300]   the end of the year tax planning articles
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.660]   and things like that are essentially click bait.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.100]   Where it's how can I get you to click on a tax
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.360]   or click on a button and most people read them
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.220]   and don't do anything with them.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.820]   But what I described in episode 116
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.900]   is something that you can actually do something with.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.640]   Put this in context.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.580]   When you see these articles,
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.460]   remember that 43 point,
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.220]   and here's why I started with 116.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.820]   Remember 43 point three percent of Americans
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.380]   pay zero federal income taxes.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.100]   Zero.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.620]   So almost half of our society
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.480]   pays zero federal income taxes.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.780]   And many of those who do pay some federal income taxes
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.020]   don't pay all that much.
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.880]   Now that's not a number that accounts
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.620]   for the total tax burden.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.380]   So it's certainly more than 43, excuse me,
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.620]   certainly less than 43 point three percent
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.620]   who pay zero employment taxes.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.580]   But it does count for federal income taxes
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.500]   and that's really the only thing
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.300]   that the end of the year counts for
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.380]   is for your federal income taxes.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.820]   So the other problem with these end of the year articles
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.740]   and end of the year planning is
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.180]   end of the year planning is really tough
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.300]   because essentially you have to have money.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.500]   And the way an income tax system works
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.760]   is you're penalized for productivity.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.720]   So the only way to essentially avoid the taxes
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.260]   is to be less productive,
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.520]   and the end of the year is too late for that.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.560]   You should have chosen in advance to be less productive.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.640]   Or to get rid of your money.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.920]   And with the way that most Americans
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.520]   conduct their financial lives,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.680]   there's not a lot of money left
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.460]   at the end of the year to get rid of.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.640]   So again, that's why I started with the other show.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.200]   But for those of you who listen to this show,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.680]   hopefully you're not in that situation.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.520]   Hopefully you are in a situation
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.660]   of overflowing with excess money and excess savings.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.760]   And now you're trying to figure out what do I do?
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.600]   What do I do?
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.320]   So that's what today's show is about.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.080]   Here's the basic rule of tax planning.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.720]   You gotta get rid of your income.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.300]   So remember, income taxes,
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.060]   you're penalized for making money.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.560]   As one of my favorite quotes, William Feather once said,
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.980]   "The reward of energy, enterprise, and thrift is taxes."
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.200]   So you gotta get rid of the money.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.240]   You gotta get rid of the money
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.220]   through one of the three fundamental tax planning strategies.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.280]   A timing strategy, a conversion strategy,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.840]   or a shifting strategy.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.080]   So with a timing strategy,
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   that's most popular at this time of year
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.040]   where you're gonna try to defer
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.360]   paying the tax towards the future.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.440]   However, you might also bring it forward.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.300]   And that's why this is pretty tough
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.720]   is you've gotta figure out what you should do with it.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.560]   Most end of the year articles that you read,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.920]   and including the majority of today's show,
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.280]   are about deferring income.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.760]   But you've gotta figure out
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   whether it's better for you to defer it
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.360]   or to actually accelerate it and bring it forward.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.200]   In general, normally we like to postpone paying the tax
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.080]   because you can pay it later with cheaper dollars.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.460]   So as inflation makes our dollars cheaper,
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.360]   if you have a tax liability of $10,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.700]   if you pay it in a later year,
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.800]   you'll be able to pay it with cheaper dollars.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.340]   So we usually wanna postpone tax
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.440]   so we can pay it later with cheaper dollars.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.400]   Also, we might be able to more productively use the money
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.200]   than using it to pay taxes.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.920]   So remember that any money that you can save on tax
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.720]   is comparable to receiving, in essence,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.400]   an interest-free loan that you can use today.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.320]   If you can avoid paying $10,000 in tax,
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.920]   that's 10,000 extra dollars that you can use
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.080]   for your purposes
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.220]   and you're not paying any interest on the money.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.220]   So that's really valuable.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.100]   However, remember that you might actually
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.280]   want to not defer income.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.620]   You might wanna actually go ahead and bring it forward
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.480]   and pay the taxes today, and there could be many reasons.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.680]   Your situation might change.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.520]   You might be in a low-income bracket at the moment
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.480]   and you expect yourself to be
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.660]   in a higher-income bracket down the road.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.380]   Well, in that situation, it's better to go ahead
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.060]   and pay the tax now in the lower bracket.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.860]   Generally, tax rates and brackets could change.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.640]   So rates on all taxpayers could change.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.560]   They could go up, they could go down.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.060]   Also, brackets could change.
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.620]   The brackets could expand, they can contract.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.100]   And so you've gotta kind of figure out
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.860]   what you're concerned with and what you're actually doing.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.040]   So think through it carefully.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.100]   Before you just go about deferring everything,
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.340]   think through it.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.500]   But with that said, with that caveat,
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.020]   'cause that is very important,
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.820]   let's get into some ideas and see if I can give you
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.780]   some tips that might be helping you.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.260]   And this is gonna be very useful.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.780]   At least one of you is probably facing a big bill
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.140]   and you need some last-minute help.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.800]   So I think I'm gonna try to give you that help.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.700]   As you're going through today's show,
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.900]   if you hear something, if you hear me talk about something
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.340]   that you don't understand, don't worry about it.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.540]   Don't try to grasp every specific detail.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.860]   If I say something like,
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.580]   make a Section 179 expense election,
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.220]   and you don't know what a Section 179 expense election is,
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.060]   don't worry about it.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.860]   Just grasp the concept if you can.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.540]   If not, come on back later and it'll start to make sense
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.380]   when we talk about it at another time.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.580]   Or if I talk about cash-basis accounting
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.160]   versus accrual-basis accounting in your business,
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.500]   if you don't understand what that means,
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.980]   don't worry about it.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.960]   Spend a little time, do a quick web search,
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.980]   and if you can find some information on it,
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.980]   that might help you.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.380]   But learning financial information
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.020]   is well done in an iterative process.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.380]   So by constantly exposing yourself to information
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.180]   that's beyond your current understanding,
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.940]   over time, your understanding will rise.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.980]   And there's always going to be something
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.400]   you don't understand.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.220]   There are so many things that I read
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.700]   that I don't understand, and it's always been that way.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.340]   But over time, when I look back now,
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.780]   I can see that over the past years,
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.300]   my understanding has increased.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.700]   And so what confused me five years ago
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.980]   to now is just old hat, I don't even have to think about it.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.860]   So listen to today's show,
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.620]   but don't worry if I throw you off on a detail or two.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.380]   Let's start with the easiest, most well-known ways
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.540]   to do some last-minute planning,
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.340]   and then we'll move to some of the more esoteric.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.220]   Let's start with retirement accounts.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.140]   Now, we're all familiar with the concept
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.100]   of deferring income through a retirement account.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.860]   And the challenge is, however,
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.500]   that most of the retirement accounts
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.140]   that most of us participate in,
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.620]   meaning 401(k)s and 403(b)s,
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.560]   these don't really help you at the end of the year,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.140]   because you have to actually make your contributions
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.700]   as you go.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.380]   So if you arrive here in December,
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.660]   and you've been putting 3% of your income aside
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.380]   into a 401(k) plan, and you recognize
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.220]   that all of a sudden you have a higher bonus payment,
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.980]   and you wanna put an extra $10,000 aside,
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.740]   generally you can't do that,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.060]   because those accounts have to be funded
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.500]   throughout the year.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.700]   So unless you can talk to your HR department,
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.540]   and this is my tip for you,
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.540]   I'm probably a little late in giving this to you,
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.980]   it's December 17th as I record this,
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.420]   so unless you can talk to your HR department
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.380]   and can defer your entire last income
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.040]   and change your election really quickly,
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.260]   defer your entire last paycheck, excuse me,
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.780]   into the account, you're probably not gonna be able
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.940]   to get much excess money into the 401(k)
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.500]   or into your 403(b).
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.380]   So those aren't really useful.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.500]   But you can use some other accounts.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.640]   If you're an individual, you can use an IRA.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.380]   And the useful thing about the IRA
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.860]   is that you don't have to make your contributions
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.360]   before the end of the year.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.340]   You can actually make your contributions
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.060]   at any time up until you file your tax return.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.820]   So here it is, December 2014.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.660]   If you file your return in April 2015,
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.440]   you have all the way up until the time
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.540]   that you file your return to make that IRA contribution.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.240]   So that can be a very useful
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.120]   last minute planning tool for you.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.060]   Now for those of you who are newbies
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.420]   to the world of finance, let me give you a quick brush up
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.600]   on the difference between your two different types of IRAs.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.060]   There is a traditional IRA, and there's a Roth IRA.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.980]   The traditional IRA permits you to go ahead
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.980]   and deduct the income now, and then later pay the tax.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.540]   The Roth IRA allows you to pay the tax now
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.220]   and deduct the income later.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.020]   Now, it's important for you to recognize
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.520]   that if everything is equal,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.600]   if your income is net now,
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.460]   is equal to your income at retirement,
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.020]   if you're in the same tax bracket
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.200]   and the tax rates are the same now and in retirement,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.620]   then those two options are mathematically identical.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.660]   This is a commonly held misconception
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.240]   that people say, well, one is better than another.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.920]   No, they're actually identical
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.300]   if your tax rates and tax brackets are the same.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.160]   Many people, if not most,
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.560]   will be in a lower income tax bracket
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.060]   and thus paying tax at a lower rate in retirement.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.120]   That's why, in general, we would usually choose
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.860]   to prefer a traditional IRA instead of a Roth IRA.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.100]   But that's not always true
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.440]   and you have to look at an individual situation.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.460]   There are other advantages and disadvantages
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.740]   and I won't go into all of those details right now.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.340]   In the year 2014, your maximum contribution
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.080]   to those two accounts is you can contribute up to $5,500.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.600]   And you can do that if you're married
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.460]   for each, both you and your spouse.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.200]   Also, if you're older than the age of 50,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.840]   don't forget that you have an additional $1,000 catch-up
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.900]   contribution that's available to you.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.760]   So you can contribute to that account
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.880]   as much as $6,500 for you.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.920]   And if you have a spouse who is also over 50,
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.840]   you can contribute up to $6,500.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.580]   Age 50 is the magic date for that catch-up contribution.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.800]   So don't forget about those catch-up contributions.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.840]   Many people, when they're making that transition,
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.760]   they're not accustomed to making
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.900]   that extra $1,000 contribution and they forget about that.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.720]   Now, I wanna spend just a moment
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.760]   going over the contribution limits.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.540]   Almost every single person that I've ever met with
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.640]   or worked with is confused by the limits.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.600]   And even when I was a new financial advisor,
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.360]   I was confused for the first couple of years of practicing
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.360]   and I was the blind leading the blind.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.440]   And so I was confused myself.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.840]   So let me explain to you the contribution limits.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.880]   And I'll try to do it in a way that makes sense.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.960]   There are two entirely different sets
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.200]   of contribution limits.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.600]   And we'll start with the simpler one.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.920]   We'll start with the Roth IRA contribution limits.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.360]   The Roth IRA is simple
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.120]   because it's purely based upon your income.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.400]   Your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.200]   is exclusively focused on how much
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.900]   your adjusted gross income is.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.200]   How much is your AGI?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.380]   That's what governs whether or not
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.440]   you can contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.920]   And those numbers for the year 2014,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.120]   if you are married filing jointly
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.000]   or a qualified widow or widower,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   if your income is below $181,000,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   your AGI is below $181,000,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.560]   then you can contribute a full contribution to a Roth IRA.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.480]   There's a phase out for the next $10,000 of income.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.760]   And then if you make more than $191,000,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.260]   you are not permitted to contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.040]   I'm going to ignore primarily the phase outs.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.080]   If you're on the bracket, if you're on the margin,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.200]   so if I say $181,000,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.080]   go and look up the chart
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.440]   and see if you're in the phase out amount,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.280]   because it's not a, all of these income limits
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   have a certain range and it will get very tedious
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.000]   if I go through each of them.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.480]   If you are single, head of household,
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.320]   or married filing separately,
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.800]   and you didn't live with your spouse
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.480]   at any time during the year,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.500]   then the limit for you is $114,000 of income.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.560]   So if your AGI is less than $114,000 and you're single,
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.160]   you can contribute to the Roth IRA.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.680]   The gotcha is if you are married filing separately
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.500]   and you lived with your spouse at any time during the year,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.040]   the limit is $10,000.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.920]   So you can't make more than $10,000 of income.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   That's the most penalized filing status of all,
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   is if you're married filing separately.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.200]   There are a bunch of gotchas in the code about that,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.040]   and this is one of them.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.520]   So with the Roth IRA,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.040]   you need to simply remember what your income is.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.520]   Single, less than $114,000.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.760]   Married, $181,000.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.560]   That's all, that's all you need to know.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   Now, a traditional IRA has a different set of scenarios,
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.720]   and this different set of scenarios is driven by
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.460]   whether or not you are covered
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.580]   by a retirement plan at work.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.520]   That's one of the key distinctions.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.880]   Your ability to contribute to the Roth
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.540]   is based upon your income.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.640]   However, your ability to contribute to an IRA
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.900]   does not have to do with your income.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.760]   Anybody can contribute to a traditional IRA,
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.280]   but your ability to deduct your contribution
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.840]   is governed by how much money you made
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   and whether or not you are covered by an employer plan.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.520]   If you are not covered by a retirement plan at work,
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.040]   so if you are just an individual
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.480]   and you only have an IRA,
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.040]   no matter how much money you make, does not matter,
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.640]   you can take a full deduction of your,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   you can take a full deduction of your contribution
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.160]   up to the contribution limit, up to the $5,500
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.120]   and then the extra $1,000 of catch up.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.820]   If you,
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.240]   this is why people get confused on it
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.120]   because it's hard for me to explain my way through.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.180]   It's much better in a visual presentation, I think.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.840]   Let me just forge on though and see if I can do it.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.480]   If you are covered by a retirement plan at work,
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.880]   then if your income as single is less than $61,000
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.280]   or if your income as married filing jointly
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.720]   is less than $98,000,
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.520]   then you can go ahead and deduct your contributions
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.440]   to a traditional IRA.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.440]   There's also a separate question
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.160]   where if you have a spouse that is covered
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.720]   by a retirement plan.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.620]   So for example, if you do not have a,
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.280]   if you're not covered by a retirement plan
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.360]   but you have a spouse who is,
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.380]   then you have to work through those numbers as well.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:51.080]   The best resource for this is go to the IRS website
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.600]   and just look at their charts
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.800]   and work your way through the charts
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.000]   and figure out the scenario that applies to you.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.260]   It's too difficult for me to convey
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.680]   on the show here at the moment.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   However, remember that the traditional IRA
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.280]   and the Roth IRA, those limits are based upon the,
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.520]   so one is based upon income,
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.040]   the other is based partly upon income
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.440]   but also partly upon employment status and marital status.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.080]   So that is a key distinction for you.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.000]   When you get into IRAs, there is one,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.960]   there are a few little tricks that you can use.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.680]   And so the simplest one is you might want to contribute
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.720]   to both types of accounts.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.480]   The limit on them is the same.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.080]   So your limit of $5,500, that's the same
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.320]   whether you do a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.880]   You can't contribute more than $5,500.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.360]   But you may, depending on your individual tax return,
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.160]   you may find that you are well-served
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.160]   by making a $2,500 contribution to a traditional IRA
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.840]   and a $3,000 contribution to a Roth IRA.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.800]   So consider that and consider calculating
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.960]   that that might serve you.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.200]   If you are over the income limits,
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.960]   then there is something that you should be aware of
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.360]   that's commonly called the backdoor Roth IRA.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.280]   And simplistically, let's say that you make
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.800]   a half a million bucks a year.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.360]   You can contribute $5,000 into a traditional IRA.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.420]   You're not permitted to deduct the contributions,
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.200]   but assuming that you're covered by an employer plan,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.760]   but you can go ahead and convert that to a Roth IRA
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.400]   in the following year, and now you are able
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.840]   to have the equivalent of a Roth IRA.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.760]   That's useful.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.400]   I think it's much less useful than it's often talked about
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.960]   simply because when you are making $500,000 a year,
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.760]   the ability to get $5,000 into a tax-sheltered account
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.080]   is much lower on your priority scale.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.120]   You're much more concerned about the $500,000.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.080]   But that is one little trick for those of you who can do it.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.400]   Couple of the little tricks on IRAs.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   It is possible if you have expenses within the IRA,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.200]   and this would be useful, many of you will have never
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.720]   thought about this, but for those of you who are using
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   something like a self-directed IRA,
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.580]   and you're paying your fees for custodianship
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.320]   or commissions or fees in a more transparent manner,
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.640]   then it is possible for you to make a separate payment
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.240]   to the account for the payment of those expenses.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.080]   So to pay your custodian fees or your brokerage commissions
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.200]   or any fees, you can make a special payment
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.920]   to the account for those fees, and you will not be deemed
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.620]   as going over the contribution limits.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.320]   That may be important to some of you,
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.220]   especially if you're pursuing a strategy of some kind
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.200]   that does involve brokerage commissions or fees
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.720]   or higher than normal custodian fees.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.220]   Consider that, that can be useful.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.720]   And so if you have $300 of fees, you can go ahead
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.620]   and make your $5,500 contribution and write a $300 check
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.480]   to pay for the payment of those fees,
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.720]   and that will maximize your usage of the account.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.820]   I hope that helps you.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.720]   There are two other types of retirement accounts
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.360]   that are also useful, and the reason why I'm going
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.280]   through these accounts here is because these are the ones
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.520]   that you can use at the end of the year
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.280]   or the following year.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.880]   You might consider, if you are self-employed
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.080]   or if you run a business, you might consider establishing
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   what is known either as an HR 10 or a KEO plan,
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.860]   or separately, you might consider establishing a SEP IRA.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.500]   Now, a KEO plan is a qualified plan that allows you
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.460]   to set up a formula for your business,
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.220]   and you can either do it for your contributions,
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.780]   and you can either do this as a defined benefit plan
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.340]   or as a defined contribution plan.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.260]   The benefit to a KEO plan is that it permits you
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:45.260]   to contribute a much higher dollar amount to the account
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.300]   than an IRA does.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.000]   So your maximum contributions are limited to 20%
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.480]   of your earned income or $52,000.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.020]   Basically comes out to, it's 20% of your earned income
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.540]   minus your deduction for half
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.500]   of your self-employment payroll tax.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.480]   So it basically comes out to 25% of your net earned income
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.240]   after you take that deduction.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.180]   So you can get 25% of your net earned income
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.720]   or $52,000 into this account.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.180]   The KEO plans were very popular for people in the past,
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.820]   for self-employed people, because there was a distinction
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.820]   in the tax law between corporate plans that were established
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.480]   and plans that could be established by self-employed people.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.380]   There was a tax law change in 2001,
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.260]   and so now the KEO plans have largely been replaced
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.720]   by the SEP IRA.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.460]   And I have, in the years of doing planning,
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.220]   I've never seen a KEO plan, I've always seen a SEP IRA.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.320]   And the reason is that they have
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.000]   the same contribution limits,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.840]   but the SEP IRA paperwork is much simpler.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.520]   The KEO plan requires a full plan document
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.000]   to be written and created.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.600]   There might be reasons still to do it,
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.900]   but it is more complicated.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.680]   A KEO plan, if you're going to establish one,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.520]   it has to be established by December 31.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.480]   Doesn't have to be funded by December 31,
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.520]   but it has to be established.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.920]   So the plan has to be actually put into place
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.320]   by the end of the year.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.680]   By the way, one of the advantages,
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.460]   and I've never seen one actually do it because of this,
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.600]   but the KEO plan, you could set it up
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.100]   so that you could borrow against it,
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.800]   where you can't borrow against a SEP IRA.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.140]   SEP IRA stands for Simplified Employee Pension Account,
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.820]   Simplified Employee Pension Plan.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.720]   And these were established with a goal of being simplified.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.780]   So these accounts, I think of them
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.040]   as an accountant's best friend.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.480]   I've never met a CPA or an accountant
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.520]   who wasn't an expert on SEP IRAs.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.180]   And the reason is they can be established
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.800]   after the end of the tax year,
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.120]   and they can be funded after the end of the tax year.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.240]   So you can go in and sit down with your accountant
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.040]   to prepare your taxes on April 1st or on April 14th,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.840]   and you can download the standard form
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.280]   from the IRS website, and you can establish your plan,
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.200]   or almost all brokerage companies
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.520]   that you will be working with
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.160]   will have the form available,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.600]   their standard form that's based on the IRS website.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.520]   It's 40, 50 pages, you print it out, you sign it,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   you write the check, and now you've gone ahead
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.900]   and created up to a $52,000 deduction
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.320]   for the year that you need it.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.200]   So that can be very, very useful.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.680]   What I would encourage you to remember
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.620]   is remember that you can have one of these plans
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.360]   in addition to your 401(k) or in addition to your IRA.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.160]   So if you, for example, are covered by a 401(k) at work,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.060]   but you have some outside self-employment income,
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.880]   you can go ahead and you can establish
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.160]   one of these types of plans,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.120]   and that might help you to avoid some taxes.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.840]   You'll have to be aware if you have employees
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.480]   that you need to cover your employees as well,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.720]   depending on how it's structured.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.160]   There's all kinds of detailed rules,
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.840]   but that's the simple thing that you need to know
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.680]   at the end of the year.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.160]   Those might be your outs.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.000]   So talk with your advisor, talk with your accountant.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.440]   Finally of the accounts here is,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.200]   actually one other little trick
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.440]   on IRAs and retirement plans.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.640]   Look to see if you might be eligible for a saver's credit.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.140]   So the saver's credit is an interesting tax credit
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.320]   that you can get if you're eligible for.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.700]   In order to stimulate low-income earners to save,
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.120]   then you can get a tax credit of 50%
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.760]   of the first $2,000 that you save in a traditional IRA,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.080]   a Roth IRA, or a 401(k), and that's a direct tax credit.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.040]   So remember, credits are always better than deductions.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.880]   This is a nice tax credit.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.180]   And that's in addition to the deductions
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.400]   that you save on the taxes by making the contribution.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.920]   Unfortunately, this is really only available
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.360]   if you have a very low adjusted gross income.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.300]   To get the full 50% credit,
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.120]   your AGI has to be less than $18,000.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.480]   So that's not a huge amount.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.720]   It's also not available for people
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.960]   who are under the age of 18 or who are full-time students
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.880]   or who are dependents that can be claimed
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.800]   on another person's tax return.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   But you might be able to get some benefit from that.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.380]   Check the chart.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.840]   The phase-outs of this change,
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.560]   the 50% contribution changes depending
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.920]   whether married, filing jointly,
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.320]   head of household, or single or otherwise.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.760]   Then there's a 20% credit and a 10% credit.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.840]   Essentially, if you make over $60,000 married,
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.520]   filing jointly, or over $30,000 for single,
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.400]   then that credit is not available to you.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.320]   But if you are down at the lower end of the earned income,
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.480]   check out the Saver's Credit
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.280]   and see if you can qualify for it.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.800]   If you can qualify for it,
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.160]   even if you can't afford to actually save
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.620]   in a retirement account,
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.720]   you may be able, if you're willing to be aggressive,
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.920]   you may be able to actually use it
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.360]   just purely for the tax credit.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.280]   So you can make a contribution, for example,
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.240]   on December 31 of this year into a Roth IRA
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.920]   and then take the distribution out of the Roth IRA
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.740]   in January of next year.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.720]   And because you're doing that in a Roth IRA,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.640]   there's no tax that would be due
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.440]   unless you had a gain in the account
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.440]   and then you would owe tax on the gain.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.720]   But you could just take that basis right out
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.200]   and you could spend that yourself.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.480]   So only the income and the gain would be taxed.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.880]   And you could get a tax credit, again,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.580]   for as much as 2,000 bucks.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.520]   So it's a one-time deal,
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.400]   but that might be worth it for you
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.500]   if you find yourself down in that scenario.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.480]   You can't afford to necessarily save the money
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.360]   for the long term,
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.720]   but that might help you to get a last-minute tax credit.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.440]   So consider that.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.320]   The last retirement account,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.920]   it's not actually a retirement account,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.680]   but it fits well into my outline here,
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.800]   is don't forget about the health savings account, the HSA.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.680]   If you're covered by a high-deductible health plan
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.080]   for your medical insurance at work or in your business,
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.260]   you can make an HSA contribution
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.540]   into your health savings account
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.100]   any time up until you file your return.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.000]   Your contribution limits for 2014 are $3,300
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   for an individual and $6,550 for family coverage.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.660]   And then there's an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.940]   for 55 and over.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.700]   So if you're over 55, that will be useful to you.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.020]   If you were doing the account in this way,
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.680]   it's not gonna save you on your employment taxes,
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.240]   but it will save you on your income taxes.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.840]   The way to save the employment tax
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.140]   is that your HSA has to be funded out of your paycheck
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.580]   so that your employer can actually deduct it
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.380]   so that you're not charged
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.980]   those employment taxes each month.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.500]   So this won't save you on the 7.65%
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.140]   Medicare and Social Security taxes,
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.100]   but it will save you on your income taxes.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.600]   So consider the HSA.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.900]   That can also be a useful way
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.740]   of taking an above-the-line deduction
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.500]   that will be helpful for you.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   Let's get out of the accounts
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.580]   'cause those are a little bit dry to work through,
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.580]   but those are the simplest, easiest,
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.020]   in some ways, most straightforward ways to do it.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.920]   But look for a way to defer income
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.260]   without using a tax account.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.160]   So here are some ideas for you.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.660]   First, just simply consider deferring income.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:24.500]   And this one's a little bit tricky if you are an employee.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.820]   So you can't do this.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.820]   Let's say that you have,
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.180]   you know you're an employee of a corporation
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.580]   and your employer is gonna pay you a Christmas bonus,
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.600]   but you take the last two weeks of the year off
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.020]   and you do this knowing that the check's gonna be sitting
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.540]   in your mailbox at work
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.820]   and so you just don't go into work and pick it up.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.220]   Well, that doesn't do it for you.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.960]   So you actually have,
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.960]   you have what's called constructive receipt of the income.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.880]   And so you're gonna be taxed on the income in the year 2014,
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.060]   even though you didn't pick up the check
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.560]   until you went back to work on January,
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.940]   what's it this year, fifth, fourth, something like that.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.340]   So that's not gonna help you.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.460]   Constructive receipt, let me explain real quick.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.800]   Anytime you're dealing with federal income taxes,
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.840]   then the doctrine of constructive receipt is used
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.320]   to determine when a cash basis taxpayer
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.980]   has received gross income.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.620]   And you as an individual are always
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.480]   at a cash basis taxpayer.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.420]   A taxpayer is subject to tax in the current year
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.480]   if he or she has unrestricted control
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.360]   in determining when items of income will or should be paid.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.640]   So unlike actual receipt,
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.440]   where you actually have to get the check,
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.240]   constructive receipt does not require
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.000]   physical possession of the item to have income
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.040]   or physical possession of the income to actually count it.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.780]   The fact that you could have gone to the office
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.680]   and picked it up means that you received it,
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.120]   you constructively received it
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.320]   even though you didn't actually receive it.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.740]   So that's not super helpful to defer a Christmas bonus.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.020]   But you actually can do this technically if you plan ahead.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.420]   So let's say that you are aware of a large bonus
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.800]   that you're gonna be receiving.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.420]   You could enter into a binding agreement with your employer
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.060]   and to defer the bonus that you would receive
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.820]   in December until January.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.360]   Now you have to actually enter into the agreement
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.820]   before the bonus is constructively received.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.380]   So that could work.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.800]   I've actually never seen it done.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.240]   I've read about it in textbooks.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.920]   I've never seen it done myself.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.720]   But I can see how it could be done.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.320]   So if you're in some scenario
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.760]   where you know there's a good bonus
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.720]   that you're likely to get
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.480]   and you would prefer because of your own personal plans
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.080]   to receive it in a later year,
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.120]   then that might be a useful technique for you.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.320]   Probably too late for this year,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.040]   but file it away for future years.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   The more useful way to defer income
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.240]   is for those of you who are business owners
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.780]   or running a business of your own of some kind.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.780]   And it's very simple if you are a cash basis taxpayer.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.960]   It's very simple to just simply delay
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.840]   billing your clients until late December.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.160]   If you don't send out your invoices until late December,
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.040]   your clients are certainly not gonna get them
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:07.920]   and spin them around
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.100]   unless they're trying to do their own tax planning.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.960]   They're certainly not gonna get them and spin them around
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.320]   and send them back to you before the end of the year.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.040]   So in that situation,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.180]   you won't actually receive payment until the following year.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.440]   And because of that, you're not gonna pay any taxes.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.160]   Now, remember, I said it a moment ago,
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.520]   but remember, it only works if you're a cash basis taxpayer.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.720]   If you're an accrual basis taxpayer in your business,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.120]   you have to report the income when it is earned,
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.280]   not when it is actually received.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.320]   So that's the same, by the way,
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.720]   for most of these business deductions.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.840]   So be careful there.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.920]   But many of you who are listening,
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.280]   who are running small businesses or self-employed,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.520]   then you'll be running,
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.220]   who are trying to figure these tax things out for yourself,
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.420]   you're likely to be a cash basis taxpayer.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.140]   If you have income from the sale of properties,
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.780]   let's say you're selling something large here
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.000]   at the end of the year,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.380]   then consider doing an installment sale.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.180]   And that will allow you to defer some of the income
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.820]   to a different tax year that might be useful for you.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.460]   If you're selling something in which you have a profit
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.600]   that you're gonna be paying tax on,
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.380]   consider an installment sale.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.300]   Also, the big one, however,
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.960]   is consider bringing forward expenses.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.280]   So consider accelerating your expenses
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.880]   to lower your net income upon which you will be taxed.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.000]   In business, think through any end of the year transactions
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.120]   that you need to pay.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.320]   So you might clear out your accounts payable.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:34.080]   You might make any, for example, this one for me,
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.440]   is I've been planning out my 2015 conference schedule.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.320]   And so what conferences am I gonna go to?
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.040]   And so I could go ahead and make the payments
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.500]   to those conferences,
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.360]   and then that would allow me to go ahead
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   and recognize the expense in this year
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.960]   for the conference that I go to in March or in June,
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.000]   something like that,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.240]   I can go ahead and recognize that expense.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.520]   You might be able to do this
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.080]   with something like your insurance payments.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.020]   So go ahead and make your insurance payments.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.200]   One of the most useful ones
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.880]   is things like marketing and advertising expenses.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.080]   If you're in a business where you know
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.280]   that if you do a certain marketing campaign
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.540]   and you purchase a certain amount of advertising,
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:19.540]   that it will result in an inflow of orders,
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.440]   then that can be super compelling for you to say,
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.400]   let me go ahead and buy up a bunch of marketing
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.000]   or advertising costs,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.580]   whether that's mailings or ads or whatever it is,
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.480]   let me go ahead and do that, pay for it in December,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.120]   and then you'll reap the rewards
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.320]   with the increased sales next year.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.200]   And you can do that,
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.560]   especially when you're building a business,
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.480]   you can do that year after year after year.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.320]   At some point in time,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.040]   you probably need to get the income out of the business,
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.520]   but that depends on the nature of your own business.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.600]   Do remember, however,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.800]   that when you are making expenses and accelerating expenses,
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.700]   that you do need to follow the 12-month rule.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.600]   And so there is, for these types of expenses,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.780]   there are two aspects to the 12-month rule.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.660]   In general, you can't deduct the full amount
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.920]   of any advance payments
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.360]   that covers more than 12 months out.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.160]   So let's say, for example,
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.880]   you can't say I'm gonna pay up my insurance premiums
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.600]   for the next three years,
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   and go ahead and make that check today
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.440]   and have that be deductible.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.000]   Rather, you can only deduct,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.200]   if you do that and it's more than 12 months,
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.920]   you can only deduct the benefits
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.480]   that are gonna be received within that tax year.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.120]   And so you would have to figure it out on a per-rata basis.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.440]   However, there is also another exception
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.880]   is that the kind of the more specific scenario to that rule,
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.280]   it's not necessarily 12 months from the expense,
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.280]   but whatever expense that you make
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   has to be, it has to be done.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:50.240]   The benefit can't go for longer than 12 months
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.720]   after the right or benefit that you purchased begins,
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.000]   or the end of the next tax year.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.880]   So end of the tax year,
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.020]   after the tax year in which the payment is paid.
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.840]   So let's say, for example,
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.480]   that could be a way that I could do it.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.440]   If I, here I'm on December 15,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   and if I go ahead and purchase an insurance policy
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.320]   that starts on January 1 and goes to December 31,
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.920]   as long as it's not more than 12 months from today
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.240]   when I go ahead and pay for it,
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.360]   and as long as it doesn't go into the tax year for 2016,
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.460]   then I can go ahead and deduct it.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.880]   So be careful with your 12 month expenses.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.200]   But as long as you follow that,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.920]   you should be fine as far as making some of those payments
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.080]   and just splitting the tax year.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.920]   Remember also that we just wanna make sure
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.440]   that you're going based upon your business's tax year,
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.280]   which may or may not be December 31.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.360]   That's super useful.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.800]   And another thought on the business tax expenses
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.040]   is consider also that you can purchase equipment.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.220]   So in general, equipment purchases
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.540]   aren't usually gonna help you
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.600]   because when you make purchases of durable equipment,
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.960]   then you have to depreciate that expense
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.920]   and you can't just simply take an expense payment now.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.560]   Now, remember, however,
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.640]   that you can make an election to expense
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.800]   a certain amount of it.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.480]   So that's called a section 179 election,
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.560]   and it was pretty good in the years past
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.840]   when it was super high.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.240]   This year in 2014, it's only $25,000.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.220]   But remember that you can actually purchase equipment,
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.560]   expense $25,000 worth of it this year,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.700]   and then go ahead and take your depreciation after that.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.140]   So then you go ahead and depreciate it
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.960]   as you are accustomed to doing.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.280]   And so that may be useful for you
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.800]   with any equipment that you need for business use,
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.460]   any tangible personal property
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.280]   that you're gonna use in business more than 50% of the time,
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.540]   any business vehicles,
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.720]   especially large business vehicles
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.520]   in excess of 6,000 pounds that you can actually do,
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.480]   vehicle that you actually can use
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.800]   the section 179 expense allowances for,
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   research that carefully
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.980]   'cause that depends on the type of vehicle.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.280]   Computers, maybe off-the-shelf software,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.920]   office furniture, office equipment,
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.800]   those types of things are eligible
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.040]   for that section 179 expense.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.420]   So if you have an extra $25,000 of profit
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.660]   that you need to wipe out,
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.280]   then if you need to buy some sort of equipment,
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.340]   then you can go ahead and buy it,
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.180]   and that gives you,
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.980]   and if you can expense the $25,000,
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.520]   you can wipe out the profit.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.840]   So that might be a useful thing for you.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.040]   When you're making expenses,
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.380]   remember that it's probably foolhardy to,
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.940]   there's no 100% tax bracket.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:33.380]   So you have to spend money in order to take a deduction.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.260]   It may or may not be good.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.660]   The only rational reason to do it
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.980]   would be if the money that you're spending,
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.460]   you expect to make more in the future
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.020]   that you'll be able to use.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.100]   So don't just spend money for the sake of spending money,
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.580]   but if it improves your business,
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.500]   then that would be a wise course of action.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.860]   Now, for individuals,
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.340]   and yourself as an individual taxpayer,
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.380]   you may still be able to use the idea
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.940]   of accelerating some of your expenses.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.180]   So a couple ideas for you.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.340]   Consider bunching certain expenses together
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.700]   here at the end of the year
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.900]   if you might be able to take a deduction.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.220]   The one that is most,
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.140]   is probably the most prevalent,
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.380]   would be something like medical expenses.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.780]   If you had a lot of medical expenses this year,
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.860]   so for example, last year,
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.540]   my wife and I, we had a lot of medical expenses
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.900]   when we had a baby.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.580]   If you had a lot of medical expenses,
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.500]   consider going ahead and adding other medical expenses now
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.340]   and getting them done.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.540]   So if you were in a year where you had a baby
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.020]   and you had a large out-of-pocket medical expense,
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.140]   then go ahead at the end of the year,
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:33.980]   if you have the money,
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.740]   go ahead and get your dental expenses,
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.580]   your eye expenses, you know, dental care,
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.380]   eye care, whatever it need, taken care of.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.340]   You might pay, go ahead and lump in
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.460]   and pay the annual premium on your long-term care insurance.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.220]   And so that might allow you
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.540]   to bunch enough medical expenses together
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.540]   to allow you to exceed the 10% of AGI limit
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.540]   on medical expenses to where you can actually deduct
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.060]   some of your medical expenses.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.080]   And these would be things
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.380]   that you're gonna have to get done anyway,
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.740]   your dental cleanings, your eye care,
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.940]   your insurance payments.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.540]   But just by bunching them,
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.820]   instead of having, let's say, $5,000 of expenses in 2014
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.620]   and $5,000 of expenses in 2015,
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.900]   whereby none of that is deductible,
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.660]   perhaps if you can bunch all $10,000 here in 2014,
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.420]   then all of it will be deducted, excuse me,
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.660]   then the portion that's over the 10% of AGI limit
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.780]   will actually be deductible.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.260]   So you can get the itemized deduction for that.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.820]   That might be useful for you.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.180]   Also consider accelerating any tax payments that you owe.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:41.300]   So real estate taxes, personal property taxes,
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:45.180]   state and local income taxes, pay them now
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.940]   in order to make sure that you can deduct them now.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.340]   And so if you pay them next year,
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.700]   then you get to deduct them next year.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.380]   But since these are gonna be due anyway,
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.400]   go ahead and bunch them together and pay them now.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.160]   This can also be useful whether or not
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.380]   you often itemize your deductions
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.060]   or take the standard deduction.
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.180]   In some years, you can, by doing this bunching strategy,
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.600]   in some years, you can bring together enough deductions
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.780]   to where it's in your benefit to itemize.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.700]   And then the following year, which is a low year,
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.780]   then you go ahead and take the standard deduction.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.700]   The next year, you go ahead and itemize.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.900]   And so you might be near that limit.
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.060]   So consider that as well.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.080]   If you're gonna do, accelerate your tax payments,
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.060]   be careful if you are concerned
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.300]   with the alternative minimum tax,
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.100]   be careful with your AMT there
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.860]   and run your calculations carefully.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.060]   Consider, we all know this one,
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.200]   'cause this is the time of year
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.900]   that we receive plenty of charitable solicitations.
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.140]   But consider making your charitable contributions
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.640]   and bunch them in the years that you can fully use them
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.340]   based upon the deduction limits
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.020]   for charitable contributions.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.220]   So sometimes that might be,
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.580]   it's gonna be as simple as going ahead,
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.620]   writing your check before the end of the year.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.780]   But then also, if you've made
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.060]   a large charitable commitment maybe,
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.900]   then go ahead and try to use those deductions in years
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.720]   when you're gonna be able to use them fully.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.540]   So if you've made a certain total amount
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.420]   and you're fulfilling your commitment
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.820]   to a charitable organization over a five-year period,
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.860]   use those deductions in the years
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.360]   where they're most useful for you.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.380]   If you are making charitable contributions,
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.820]   be intelligent about how you do it,
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.100]   especially with regard to good tax planning.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.100]   Don't think only in terms of cash.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.900]   This is one, depending on the size of the,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.860]   depending on the nature of your finances,
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.420]   just don't always give something always in cash.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.380]   If you have appreciated property
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.420]   that you've held for over 12 months,
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.900]   then you can go ahead and donate,
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.980]   if the charity will accept it,
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.260]   you can donate the appreciated property.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.880]   And so if you have $10,000 worth of stock
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.820]   that has appreciated from $5,000
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:51.200]   and you wanna give $10,000 to the charity,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.060]   it's probably better for you to give the $10,000 of stock.
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.340]   You'll get your full deduction
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.140]   for the fair market value of the stock, the $10,000,
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.800]   and that will allow you to avoid paying tax
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.820]   on the gain of the $5,000.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.300]   The charity receives the stock,
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.860]   they sell it at the fair market value,
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.440]   and then they get their cash,
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.260]   but that gives you a more advantageous
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.940]   charitable contribution than if you were just simply
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.980]   to give the $10,000 of cash
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.400]   upon which you've already paid income tax.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.100]   So that could be useful for you, consider that.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.120]   If you have lost property, then the rule is reversed.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.620]   With the rule with lost property,
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.920]   let's say that you've purchased stock for $10,000
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.980]   and it's worth $5,000 and you sell it,
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.540]   or you decided that you're gonna sell it
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.940]   and you don't wanna keep it any longer.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.340]   Well, in that situation, what you always wanna do there
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.740]   is you wanna sell it for $5,000,
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:47.620]   take the $5,000 loss against your tax,
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.900]   and then go ahead and donate the cash to the charity.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.900]   So make it up and give them the $5,000
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.260]   out of your savings account.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.380]   So just be smart about that.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:00.140]   Oftentimes, giving property, if the charity will accept it,
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.140]   might be more helpful to you,
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.980]   especially if it's appreciated property,
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.420]   might be more helpful to you than giving cash,
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:10.460]   and you can basically get a double use out of it.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:14.740]   With regard to timing of these expenses and deductions,
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.140]   remember that you can take deductions
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.420]   for items that you pay by check in the current year,
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.580]   even if you mail the check on New Year's Eve.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.300]   As long as there's no reason why,
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.000]   when the business or person or charity receives it
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.840]   on January the 3rd, that they can't cash the check,
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.940]   then you can go ahead and take the deduction this year.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.220]   If you're doing that, and if it's a sizable amount
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.060]   that you need, make sure, I would get it,
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.300]   what's it called with the post office,
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.700]   where they registered mail or whatever,
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.860]   where they give you the receipt for it,
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.900]   I would do that to make sure you have that date stamp
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.240]   and keep it with your records.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.120]   Credit card charges can also be taken this year.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.100]   So let's say that you go out and you purchase some items
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.080]   in order that you're going to be deducting,
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.060]   and you purchase those items in December.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.940]   Well, you probably won't receive the credit card bill
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.380]   due until January.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.860]   So that'll allow you to go ahead
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.460]   and take the deduction in this year,
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.700]   and then pay it next year.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.840]   So that can be useful in some situations.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   The two final sections, that concludes kind of the timing
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.620]   of income and expenses.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.940]   The other couple of ideas for you
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.100]   are with regard to relationships.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.980]   And so there are various relationships
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.820]   that are going to affect your tax planning.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.660]   First is, probably the most not useful,
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.280]   is the marital relationship.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.700]   So if you're planning a wedding at the end of the year,
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.500]   or like New Year's Day, my wife and I actually,
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.180]   we got married on New Year's Day.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.760]   And so if you're planning something like that,
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.980]   calculate your taxes and see when you should actually
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.860]   have the marriage done.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.460]   Doesn't have to be the same day necessarily
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.700]   as the wedding itself.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.080]   So we certainly could have legally gotten married
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.580]   on December 31, and then had our wedding celebration
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.700]   on January 1.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.940]   And if we were married on December 31,
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.260]   then that would allow us to file as married filing jointly,
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.460]   for that year that we got married.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.280]   In general, marriage is only gonna diminish your taxes
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.840]   if one spouse works, or earns almost all the income.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.180]   If both spouses work and earn relatively good incomes,
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.420]   then marriage is actually gonna boost your taxes.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.780]   So be a good idea, just calculate it,
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.780]   and see which is more in your interest to do.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.980]   With regard, the big one though however,
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.540]   is with regard to dependency.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.780]   And the number of dependents that you can claim
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.860]   for your dependency exemptions.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.460]   Most people when they think about dependents
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.060]   actually think purely about kids.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.760]   And that may be helpful.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.420]   So most of the time, children are not something
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.700]   that you do last minute tax planning with.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.000]   Generally they arrive over a period of many months,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.980]   and you don't have a lot of control over when they come.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.360]   If you do have something where for example,
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.980]   you might have a plan C section,
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.460]   this happened to a family member of mine,
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.580]   you have a plan C section,
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.340]   and the safe zone for safe delivery covers
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.100]   the end of last week of December,
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.220]   and the first week of January.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.100]   You might go ahead and schedule them December 31,
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.940]   so that you can go ahead and take your child credits,
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.540]   and your dependency exemptions.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:22.540]   But that'll apply to maybe, to not many people.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.220]   The major benefit though that I've thought of
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.980]   for some of you might be if you're caring
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.060]   for other dependents who aren't your kids.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.320]   And I'm thinking of parents or grandparents
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.900]   that you might be caring for.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.100]   Now when you get to dependency exemptions,
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.800]   there are a bunch of detailed rules,
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.420]   and some different tests that you need to pass.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.820]   So for example, to claim a dependency exemption
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.580]   for a qualifying relative who's not a child,
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.740]   then there's the dependent taxpayer test,
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.880]   the joint return test, the citizenship test,
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.560]   the not a qualifying child test,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.640]   the member of a household or relationship test,
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.740]   the gross income test, and the support test.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.460]   So some tests, and there's some detailed rules
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.020]   that you should focus on, and read through,
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.520]   and talk through with your advisor.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.660]   But the one I wanna focus on is if you're providing support
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.060]   for your dependent.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.180]   And support can mean different things.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.980]   And this might be for kids,
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.660]   or this might be for other relatives as well,
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.660]   or even other non-relatives.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.620]   But support would include amounts that are spent
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:26.620]   for food, shelter, clothing, medical and dental care,
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:31.660]   education, church contributions, childcare expenses,
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.640]   wedding apparel and receptions,
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.060]   capital items, and similar items.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:43.060]   So the key here is that support is measured
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:48.660]   by what is spent, not what is available.
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:53.700]   So if you are wanting to claim your child as a dependent,
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.880]   it doesn't really matter if your child earns $10,000,
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.540]   and then saves half of it.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:06.540]   As long as you spend $5,001 on them in support,
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:10.420]   then you've actually contributed more than one half
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.020]   of their support, and that will allow you
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.460]   to take the dependency exemption.
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.700]   So there are a number of different strategies
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.620]   that can happen here.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.700]   Because you might, for example,
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.780]   you might make some payments for things
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.600]   that your child needs, or you might support them
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.740]   with a purchase at the year end of a car,
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.660]   a capital item like that, perhaps paying for, again,
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.220]   wedding apparel and receptions, education costs,
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.940]   things like that, going ahead and making those payments.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.420]   And however, if you were caring for a parent,
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.220]   then if you're contributing more than half of their support,
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.100]   that might allow you to claim them as a dependent.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.020]   So for example, let's say that you've been planning
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.780]   to give your mother or your father,
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.900]   if my father or mother were in a nursing home,
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.820]   and I knew they needed something,
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.780]   and I was gonna go ahead and contribute
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.080]   to the cost of that, but then at the end of the year,
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.900]   I wanna go ahead and give her or him
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.420]   some kind of item for their needs,
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.780]   so a large television for their room, for example.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.260]   Well, as long as I track that, if I provide more
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.760]   than 50% of their support, then I can go ahead
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.640]   and possibly, as long as I fit the other qualifications,
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.140]   claim them as a dependent.
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:23.260]   And the key would be actually calculating this
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.060]   for yourself and seeing if your ability
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.140]   to claim them as a dependent is going to be
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.020]   in their best, is in your best interest
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.260]   and in their best interest.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.980]   And so there are a number of different ways
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.780]   that you could do this, but it might even be,
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.540]   for some people, it can be worth it to compensate.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.420]   If, for example, you are going to claim somebody
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.680]   as a dependent and that's going to,
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.440]   and you're in a higher bracket,
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.700]   this is one of those income shifting strategies,
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.980]   kind of partly, is this might allow you,
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.140]   you might reimburse them for some of the tax costs
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.260]   to them and just go ahead and allow them to,
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:01.260]   so that you can actually claim the expense.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.060]   So you want to calculate it out,
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.260]   depending on who's got what bracket and see.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.420]   And that might, again, for many of you
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.140]   who are caring for parents or grandparents,
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.240]   then that can be a really valuable scenario.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.200]   And considering that you need to provide
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.820]   that care regardless, then make sure
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.260]   that you do it in a way that's going,
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:25.620]   where you're gonna allow the tax code
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.060]   to subsidize your expense.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.900]   Oh, and I forgot, one of the things,
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.460]   when you're figuring out your dependent's income,
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:37.420]   remember that you can exclude any type of exempt income.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   And exempt income would be things like
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.820]   including social security benefits,
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.260]   tax-exempt interest, et cetera.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:49.740]   So the key there is your dependent can still,
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.740]   so if my mother or father were in a nursing home,
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.980]   they can, doesn't matter how much
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.620]   social security income they receive,
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.700]   that's a tax, that's exempt for the purpose
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.420]   of calculating the dependency.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:03.980]   The key is how much actually gets paid for their support.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.300]   And it's based upon the money spent,
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.460]   not the money received.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.160]   So that's how we pass the support test.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:14.580]   So do some research if you think that might apply to you
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.660]   and see if you can work a way into that.
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.860]   Very briefly on investment tax planning,
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.200]   I don't want to go into details on investment tax planning.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.320]   I just want to mention one concept.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.540]   I've seen over the last year, I would say, two years,
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:32.060]   a lot more interest in the concept of
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.300]   tax loss harvesting for investment planning.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.500]   And I think this has been primarily due to
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.460]   some of the robo-advisors have made it very easy
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:45.460]   and efficient to actually harvest your tax losses.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.220]   It's not always easy to go through and figure out,
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.580]   well, what can I sell to defer my gains?
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.640]   I just want to emphasize that that's really great
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.640]   and that's valuable and that's useful.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.720]   I want to emphasize that the flip side to that is
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.420]   you also want to make sure that your harvest
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.480]   sometimes harvest your gains.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.640]   And so the key, if you can establish a bookkeeping system
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.360]   that's going to, excuse me, allow you to be
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:13.240]   detail-oriented enough to actually be able to,
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:19.040]   if you can establish a bookkeeping system
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.280]   that's going to permit you to do these kinds of
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.840]   calculations in advance, sometimes you might want to
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.780]   go ahead and harvest gains.
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:30.780]   And so let's say that you've purchased stock
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:37.020]   and you currently have a tax basis of $5,000 in the stock
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:40.860]   and the market value is $10,000.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:44.520]   Well, if you have some extra money sitting on your
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.620]   tax return at a relatively low bracket,
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.780]   or at something at a relatively low bracket,
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.860]   you might be in your best interest to go ahead
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:55.220]   and sell some of the stock and then buy it back
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.660]   in order to increase your gain, excuse me,
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:58.900]   increase your basis.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:02.780]   And so you want to always essentially calculate both sides.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.360]   Now, this is easy to say in theory
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.260]   and it's hard to do in practice,
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.480]   at least it's harder to do in practice.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.700]   But go and calculate it and make sure that you're not
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.180]   just focusing on tax loss harvesting,
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.220]   but that you're actually focusing on tax gain harvesting
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.900]   and essentially over time ratcheting up your basis
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.180]   in your investments, however you can.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:24.960]   And I hope that's helpful to you.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.340]   Those are the primary ideas that I wanted to share with you.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.500]   I hope they're helpful.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:36.260]   And the key is good tax planning is gonna make
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.740]   a profound difference in your financial picture.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.960]   The biggest expense that most of us face is tax.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:47.960]   And it's a difficult subject to tackle
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.520]   because there's so many aspects of it.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.080]   There's so many different kinds of tax.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.520]   We're just talking today about federal income tax planning.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.440]   There are so many moving variables.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.900]   Our tax system is so incredibly complicated
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.360]   that it's very difficult, so daunting for me to figure out
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.760]   how do I teach through this?
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.520]   I mean, I get stretched by it.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.920]   How do I teach through this in a way
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.360]   that's actually gonna be helpful?
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.280]   So I hope, again, I hope this has been helpful.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.640]   Always look and just think about your specific situation
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.560]   because that's the key.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.880]   This is gonna be doing tax planning for end of the year,
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   planning for a young single dad or single mom
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.960]   with a moderate income and a lot of expenses.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.820]   There are certain ideas or tactics that might help,
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.040]   but that's very different than if you're doing tax planning
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.920]   for somebody with a $50 million estate
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.880]   and we're trying to move assets out of the estate.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.320]   There are a lot of moving parts.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.240]   So keep absorbing the information
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.600]   and just keep looking at your situation.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.900]   Anytime there is an anomaly, for example, a market anomaly,
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:53.160]   if you have a large major price decline
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.120]   in the value of an asset or a large increase
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.440]   or absurdly low interest rates
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.160]   or absurdly high interest rates,
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.600]   then those are the kinds of things
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.360]   sometimes you can exploit that.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.320]   So for example, if markets are down,
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.280]   then a couple years ago, that was when,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.200]   if you were in estate planning,
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.600]   you were constantly busy getting assets out
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.680]   'cause you wanna get them out
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.320]   when they're at a low valuation
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.240]   so you can get them out
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.080]   when they're basically destroyed in value
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.920]   where they can rise and the money is out of your estate.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.460]   So there are a lot of moving parts.
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.040]   I hope that this has been useful
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.480]   and I'd love some feedback,
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.480]   but the key is you gotta just look at your situation.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.160]   Remember though that we're coming up on 2015
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.940]   and this is the time to start planning for your 2015 plans.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.000]   Focus on goals, focus on income,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.480]   but don't forget about tax plans as well.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.700]   You just heard what was actually the original show
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:47.880]   that I had recorded today.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.800]   However, you are privileged
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.000]   to get a little bit of a bonus episode here.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.680]   (laughs)
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:57.000]   I recorded that show today as I record this now,
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.280]   it is December 17th, 3.20 p.m.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.380]   I recorded that show this morning
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.720]   and I had to leave my house
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.320]   and just leave my house for an appointment
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.940]   and I was planning to get the show uploaded here
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:08.120]   this afternoon.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.600]   Then I find out all of a sudden
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.960]   through one of my news feeds that the law has changed
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.700]   or is in the process of changing.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.160]   And let me clarify what specifically is wrong
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   in the show that I just recorded
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.400]   and then I'm gonna rant a little bit
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.720]   because this is incredibly frustrating.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.900]   So I find out through an email
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.120]   from one of the services and things that I subscribe to
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   that now as of last night, Tuesday, December 16, 2014,
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.600]   there is a bill that is passed by the Senate
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.400]   and the Senate votes to pass the so-called,
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.280]   what's this called?
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   HR 5771, Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.360]   So it was passed by the Senate last night
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.420]   and as of right now as I record this,
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.460]   it's on its way to the President's desk, I guess,
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.360]   and theoretically he's gonna sign it.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.560]   So I'm looking at this thing
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.120]   and the big thing that I got wrong
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.540]   was I made a special note in the show that you just heard
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:07.540]   about the Section 179 ability to expense allowance
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.180]   where for the last few years,
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.760]   that expense allowance had been,
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:15.760]   you were able to expense as much as $500,000,
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:21.100]   $500,000 of your upfront equipment costs in a single year
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:24.860]   and then it was limited to $25,000 for this year.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.820]   So then here we are at December 16 when this bill is passed.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.500]   It's not been signed by the President yet that I know.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.340]   I'm looking at govtrack.us and it doesn't indicate
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.160]   that it's been signed by the President yet.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.220]   So here we are sitting here in December
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:43.200]   and they're about to pass this bill evidently,
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.500]   which is among other things,
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:49.500]   is going to extend the $500,000 Section 179
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:53.300]   upfront expensing limits.
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.260]   The full title here,
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.420]   to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.180]   to extend certain expiring provisions
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.940]   and make technical corrections
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:01.460]   and it goes on.
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.740]   So I'm looking at the bill.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.240]   I'm not gonna go through every section in here,
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.620]   but it goes,
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:09.140]   I'm looking at all of the things that are expiring
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:13.060]   and it covers 100% of the Section 179 stuff
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.020]   and that extends that out.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:14.860]   So that's what you need to know
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:17.460]   is basically that right now in December,
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:21.980]   if you need to spend a bunch of money now,
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:25.100]   you can't only just take a $25,000 expense allowance.
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.020]   You can actually maybe,
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.980]   if the President signs this thing,
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.540]   you can go and take a $500,000 expense allowance.
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.260]   So the first thing you should do is call your accountant
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:35.620]   and if you need to purchase some equipment
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.460]   or something to knock off a bill this year,
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.660]   this might be a time to do it.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:39.740]   So talk to your accountant.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.980]   I can't give any further advice in that.
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:42.940]   But this is just,
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:46.440]   this is so frustrating.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.940]   We have a nation that is run by a bunch of clowns
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:53.180]   and two-year-old clowns that can't,
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:56.940]   I'm bad at political rants
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.260]   'cause I've signed off of all the political nonsense.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.780]   I'm done.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:01.980]   I've quit.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.780]   Just leave me alone and I will,
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.260]   I'm speechless.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.760]   I can't even do a political rant.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.260]   Most of my friends, I'm good at doing political ranting.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.100]   It's so frustrating,
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.300]   the way that tax policy is done in this country.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.740]   It's so frustrating.
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:19.340]   If you look back at it,
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:21.340]   I mean, it reminds me,
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.860]   if you go back to 2012,
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.660]   when you had at the end of 2012,
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:30.580]   we're approaching the fiscal cliff,
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.060]   the tax Armageddon,
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.980]   and there was gonna be the biggest overnight increase
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:39.860]   in taxes in the history of the country.
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.820]   The actual, I mean,
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.220]   the tax rates would have jumped massively
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.340]   when this was,
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.460]   the Bush tax cuts had expired a couple years earlier,
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:48.520]   though everything was extended,
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.300]   everything was gonna be forced through.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.500]   And so the maximum tax,
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.700]   a year ago,
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.060]   the maximum tax on dividends
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.140]   was scheduled to jump from 15%
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:59.940]   to as much as 43 1/2%.
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:01.940]   Four out of five US households
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:06.720]   would have faced an average of $3,700 more in taxes.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.260]   It was basically gonna be an $8 trillion tax increase.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.440]   And what is so frustrating
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.420]   is everybody knew what needed to be done.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.660]   Everybody knew what was going to be done.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.860]   Everybody knew,
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.360]   like, it's all known in advance
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.740]   exactly what's gonna happen.
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.340]   Everyone's gonna talk a big talk.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.500]   You know, the left and the right,
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.060]   the Democrats are gonna talk a big talk
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.900]   about not raising taxes,
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.860]   and the Republicans are gonna talk a big talk
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.060]   about not raising taxes.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.260]   In the end, they're all liars,
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.060]   and they do exactly the same thing.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.980]   But they have to wait till after the elections.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.340]   So instead of anybody being able
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.900]   to actually plan on anything
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:42.360]   and actually run their business
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.940]   with a bit of confidence,
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.360]   if I were advising a business owner,
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.280]   how do you sit here and say,
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.120]   oh, all of a sudden,
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.980]   I told you you had a $25,000 limit
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.040]   on your 179 expense right now,
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.580]   but now you got a $500,000 limit?
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.780]   How do you plan in this kind of environment?
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.960]   It is utterly,
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.460]   it is,
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.580]   anyway,
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.700]   the world we live in is just ridiculous.
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.780]   You know, when,
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.980]   here I,
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.540]   when you can't even expect,
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.020]   here at December,
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.780]   and I'm already late on a show like this,
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.340]   I'd prepared my outline carefully,
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.700]   I'd researched everything to be very precise,
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.860]   and here I am,
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.920]   here I am trying to give a precise show
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.360]   to help people,
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.220]   and then you've got the Congress clowns move around
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.280]   and the end of December change the rules again.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.680]   And you look here and,
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.920]   section 101,
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.640]   extension of deduction for certain expenses
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.300]   of elementary and secondary school teachers.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.140]   Section 102,
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.000]   extension of exclusion from gross income
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.880]   of discharge of qualified principal residents
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.720]   and debtors.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.120]   So we gotta pander to the people
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.380]   and extend this stupid thing on,
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.580]   allowing you to go through a short sale.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:52.420]   What does that even do?
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.460]   If that's what it is,
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.500]   what does this do for all the people who,
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.700]   their account advisor,
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.940]   and they were gonna have to pay the tax.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.620]   When you have debt that's forgiven to you,
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.460]   it's imputed income,
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.660]   it's phantom income,
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.460]   and we've gotta protect the people,
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.020]   and we've gotta give a special deal to everyone
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.420]   in the housing crisis to avoid the tax.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.260]   Section 103,
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.900]   extension of parity for employer-provided
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.620]   mass transit and parking benefits.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.460]   Section 104,
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.260]   extension of mortgage insurance premiums
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.100]   treated as qualified resident's interest.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:18.940]   Section 105,
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.180]   extension of deduction of state
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.220]   and local general sales taxes.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.180]   I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.920]   The business tax extenders,
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.260]   extension of the research credits,
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.100]   114,
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.800]   Indian employment tax credit,
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.820]   new markets tax credit.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.020]   And basically what all these things are
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:35.860]   is extensions of things that were scheduled to expire.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.180]   I haven't read the whole bill here,
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.820]   and just looking at the summary.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:44.820]   We live in a nation of incompetence,
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.020]   incompetent rulers,
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.180]   and it would be great to get rid
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.020]   of every single one of 'em.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.920]   I mean, maybe there's some that are intelligent,
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.860]   but it is absurd.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.940]   Since I'm, if you want a little fun,
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.620]   I'll indulge myself.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.420]   I usually don't rant on taxes,
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.180]   but this one has me annoyed,
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.020]   just because,
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.980]   I guess it passed last night,
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.260]   so technically I should have done my research this morning
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.380]   when my outline was already prepared.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.220]   But,
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.660]   so I'm gonna pull down one,
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.140]   I've got one of my favorite books here,
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:13.980]   and this is,
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.620]   I'll read a couple of things from Jeff Schnepper's
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.140]   How to Pay Zero Taxes book.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.340]   And he updates this,
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.500]   I have the 2015 edition,
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.580]   and he updates this thing every year,
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.220]   and in the front he talks about what happened in each year.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.700]   And,
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.060]   I'll just read a few of my favorites
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.700]   from the last few years.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.540]   And hopefully you'll get a kick out of this,
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:36.020]   and then I'll be done and be out of here.
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:36.860]   You would have been impressed.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.140]   The original show was under 60 minutes,
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.660]   so you would have been impressed with that.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:43.060]   But let's pick a couple of fun ones here.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:43.900]   So,
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.660]   from his section on 2012,
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:53.420]   so after that debacle of the fiscal cliff,
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.780]   according to the Joint Committee on Taxation in March 2012,
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.000]   the prior cost of kicking the can down the road
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.880]   for tax cuts, extenders, estate tax, et cetera,
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.600]   through fiscal year 2012,
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.600]   was $967.7 billion in wasted dollars.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.740]   Add to that decreased stability
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.060]   and the inability to properly budget into the future,
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.900]   and you had a framework for economic impotence.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.380]   Don't blame the IRS.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.780]   Then Commissioner Doug Shulman warned,
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.940]   if Congress can't act by the end of the year,
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.700]   and even starts to think about retroactive legislation
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.380]   of things like the AMT, which have already expired,
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.580]   you could have a real disaster in the filing season
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.060]   when there's total confusion
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.020]   where some people are filing under one law
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.700]   and others under another.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:36.740]   Congress finally passed
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:39.040]   the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:39.940]   to address these issues,
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.260]   and they do it on the day after 2012.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.700]   It's January 1, 2013.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.320]   Here are a couple others from 2011.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.900]   Actually, before I go to 2011,
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.660]   let's look at a couple of the fun ones from 2013.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.340]   So the Internal Revenue Service reportedly posted
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.560]   the Social Security number of tens of thousands of people
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.820]   on the internet before taking it down,
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.260]   wherein a whistleblower pointed out the mistakes.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:09.580]   Approximately 1.45 million taxpayers
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.460]   who qualified for relief from tax penalties
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.940]   totaling close to $181 million
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.080]   were never told that they could get penalty abatement
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:16.920]   and never got it.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.100]   Here's one of my favorites.
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.300]   The IRS could not provide documentation
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:24.620]   for $394,430 paid for labor hours.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.340]   Point that out in your next audit.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.100]   How about this one?
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.460]   The American Civil Liberties Union
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.940]   released documents showing that the IRS criminal division
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.460]   had been reading taxpayers' emails without a warrant
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:35.980]   in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.700]   That makes you feel good, doesn't it?
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.180]   And then there were the IRS parties.
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.500]   During one conference, more than $50,000
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.820]   was spent on receptions,
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.020]   including 28 bottles of wine for 41 guests.
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:49.540]   Then there was the almost $4,000 spent on giveaway items,
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.980]   including footballs, $418 in kazoos,
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:56.220]   bathtub toy boats, and other novelty decorations.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.980]   IRS credit cards were used to purchase romance novels,
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.860]   steaks, diet pills, and unspecified items
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.700]   from merchants affiliated with online pornography.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.300]   Your tax money at work.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:10.500]   The IRS spent about $50 million on 225 conferences
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.660]   during the three years between fiscal 2010 and 2012.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.220]   The small business and self-employed division
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.700]   spent $4.1 million alone on a single conference
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.060]   in Anaheim, California.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.220]   You should have been there.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.660]   Speaker fees for presentations such as, quote,
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.020]   "How seemingly random combinations of ideas
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.900]   "can drive radical innovation," close quote,
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.500]   totaled $135,350.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:38.420]   One speaker was paid $17,000 to create six paintings.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.180]   Three were donated to charity,
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.900]   two were given to conference attendees,
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.700]   and the sixth was lost.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:48.100]   Then there were the videos that cost $50,107 to produce.
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.960]   They included a dance video showing IRS employees
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.860]   learning the Cupid Shuffle and a Star Trek parody
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.100]   for which the set alone cost $2,400
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.820]   and 11 hours of staff work,
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:02.160]   estimated to cost an additional $3,100.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.620]   But they did get a one-minute finished video.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.920]   We won't even talk about the IRS video parody
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.500]   of Gilligan's Island used to train
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.060]   1,900 taxpayer-assisted employees
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.580]   in 400 locations nationwide.
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:16.380]   As Maynard G. Krebs would say, "Work?"
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.220]   In addition to these large expenditures,
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:23.220]   the IRS spent $15,669 of your money on brief bags
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.400]   with free gifts and trinkets,
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.660]   $6,060 on lanyards and badge holders,
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:32.900]   $1,524 on engraved travel mugs and clocks,
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.380]   and $90 on sleeves for puzzle pieces.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.800]   And then there were the political issues.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.840]   The supposedly politically independent IRS
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.000]   was found to have targeted conservative groups
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.620]   seeking tax exemption for extra scrutiny.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:48.740]   The TIGTA found the, that's a taxpayer,
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:53.500]   Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.360]   The TIGTA found the inappropriate conduct, quote,
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.200]   "inexcusable," and Attorney General Eric Holder,
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.180]   another liar, announced that criminal penalties
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:03.880]   may be sought in a Justice Department
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.400]   criminal investigation.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.280]   Add that to the 24 IRS employees who were indicted
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.560]   for fraudulently obtaining more than $250,000
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.600]   in government benefits, and you have what some
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.200]   would call a rogue agency out of control.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.300]   It didn't even go into the Lois Lerned debacle.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.980]   Bunch of lies.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.680]   Let me pick out two or three of my other favorites,
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.320]   and then that'll satisfy my desire
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.380]   to express my emotions today.
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:35.760]   There's a David Letterman joke that the question is,
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.680]   "What's the difference between Obama's cabinet
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.300]   "and a penitentiary?"
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.320]   And the answer, "One is filled with tax evaders,
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.480]   "blackmailers, and threats to society.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.480]   "The other is for housing prisoners."
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.000]   It was a David Letterman joke.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.320]   So a lot of people don't realize why.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.640]   I'll read just one of my favorites from 2009.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.440]   And this is, again, this is Jeff Schnepper's writing here.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.800]   "I'm beginning to understand now.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.880]   "The tax code is the holy grail,
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.960]   "the answer to all our social and economic problems.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.640]   "If we have a problem, it can be solved
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.760]   "through the tax code.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.040]   "Need to sell more cars?
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.160]   "Simple, make the sales tax on their purchase deductible,
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.320]   "even for those taking the standard of deduction,
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.520]   "and create a clunker's credit.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.260]   "But then again, the government does own

[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.780]   "Still, I stand by my argument.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.280]   "Your house went down in value?

[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:27.040]   "Again, even for those taking the standard deduction.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.020]   "Oil prices getting too high again?

[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.840]   "for the President's Cabinet.

[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.960]   "In 1998, he was quoted as saying,
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.080]   "'Make no mistake, tax cheaters cheat us all,
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.420]   "'and the IRS should enforce our laws to the letter.'"
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.460]   The President's selection
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.200]   for the first Chief Performance Officer
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.560]   for the federal government, Nancy Killefer,
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.000]   failed to pay tax on her household help.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.840]   Both had the good graces to withdraw from consideration.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.600]   And then there was Ron Kirk,
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.120]   nominated to be the U.S. Trade Representative.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.120]   He forgot to report $37,000 in spending
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.100]   and speaking fees assigned to a charity,
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:52.500]   but he managed to remember taking a deduction
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.580]   for $7,500 of the donation.
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.980]   And then there was $7,400 in pro basketball tickets
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.700]   without a business purpose.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.100]   Cheating on his taxes didn't defer Timothy Geithner
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.500]   from becoming Treasury Secretary.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.860]   His taxes were found to be underpaid in 2001,
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:12.900]   2002, 2004, and 2005.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.300]   What, nobody looked at 2003?
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.420]   But then again, who better to put in charge
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:21.040]   of the IRS than someone who requests a ruling on the law
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.240]   and then ignores it?
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.380]   But he did pay up when caught.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.560]   Talk, anyway, you get the point.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.940]   And it's just, it's utterly absurd.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.260]   There's actually an important quote in here that he lists.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:38.800]   And the quote is by former Commissioner
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.480]   of the IRS, Mark Everson.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.960]   He says, "Frequent changes to the tax code
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.380]   "and rising complexity are perhaps the greatest obstacles
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.480]   "to reducing paperwork burden.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.700]   "I am concerned that tax law complexity
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:54.000]   "may discourage taxpayers and adversely impact
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.620]   "voluntary self-assessment that is at the heart
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.100]   "of our tax system."
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:02.740]   And the point is, self-reporting and self-assessment
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.420]   of taxes is indeed the heart of the tax system.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:09.700]   And it's absurd to have things, I mean,
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.660]   to have things changing like this is absolutely absurd.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:18.100]   We've had over 48 major tax law changes
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.940]   in the last 51 years.
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.700]   Couple of numbers here.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:26.340]   2013 return numbers directly from the IRS.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:30.540]   The average taxpayer who files a Form 1040 needs 15 hours.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.500]   Add a single rental property or a Schedule C
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.260]   for your business and the hours jump to 24.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:38.440]   And that's with about 91% filing with a computer.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.180]   We spend more than 7.7 billion hours
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.940]   and over $350 billion each year complying with the tax code
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.700]   just to figure out what we owe.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:52.020]   That's more hours than are used to build every car,
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.940]   van, truck, and airplane manufactured in America.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.260]   And that's just your time.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:13:00.340]   And our government wants your money as well.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.660]   According to the Tax Foundation,
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:05.060]   the average taxpayer had to work 111 days
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:09.940]   until April 21, 2014 in order to earn enough
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.500]   to cover his federal, state, and local tax burden.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.000]   They call it Tax Freedom Day.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.080]   I call it Get Out of My Pocket Day.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.720]   The Group Americans for Tax Reform
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.280]   includes the cost of regulation.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.160]   Its cost of government day had us working
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.540]   for the government until July 6, 2014.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:35.500]   I don't even know what to say.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.260]   I don't know when people are gonna wake up
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:42.020]   and I do my best to try to stay level-headed
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:46.260]   and not get too fired up about stuff
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.040]   and I don't get on a political bandwagon.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.140]   But it's absolutely absurd.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:54.340]   It's, the world we live in is absurd.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:57.700]   And remember, all of those numbers,
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.180]   and I won't go into it.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.620]   Things are gonna change as time goes on.
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.660]   And obviously, the key is for us
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.180]   to look at our own situation
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:10.120]   and figure out what's right for us.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.660]   You have to look at yourself.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.580]   This way, I'm way more sympathetic
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.680]   to the tax protesters than I've ever been.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.760]   I'm not there yet, but you never know.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.460]   One of these days, I may join 'em.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.380]   If I do, I'll go public with it from the beginning
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.620]   and I'll write my letter to the IRS.
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.640]   Until then, I will try to comply
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.260]   with their law that they changed.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.240]   This bill they passed last night, 174 pages.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.280]   So how on earth is any, and that's just one thing.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.920]   The tax code is over, right now,
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.080]   as it sits right now in 2014,
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:51.860]   it's over 70,000 pages.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:57.960]   Over 70,000 pages and over four million words.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.920]   That's the tax code that we have.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.940]   It's very hard for me to comprehend
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.640]   how just a tiny little bit of intelligence
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.420]   and applied sense can't see that we can figure out
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   a better way to do it other than the debacle that we have.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.560]   That's it for my show.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.840]   Little different ending than the previous ending.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.800]   I just chopped off the last bit of the other show.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.360]   So a little bit different than I had planned,
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.280]   but I hope today was helpful to you.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.980]   I guess I should add another tax tip
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:35.020]   to all the last minute tax planning
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.580]   and say, well, you could just do what seems like half of,
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:41.000]   probably, I guess that'd be a little bit silly.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.160]   And yes, I'm not indulging.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.280]   These aren't careful, logical arguments that I'm giving.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.260]   It's just simply a little bit of emotion.
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:53.000]   But I guess you could just join
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.560]   some of the officials in government
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.600]   and just simply conveniently forget
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.940]   about half your income for the year.
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.920]   That would probably be pretty good.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.060]   In fact, I encourage it.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.360]   So if it works for them,
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.320]   you ought to take it for yourself.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.100]   Seems to work well.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.960]   Thank you guys so much for listening to today's show.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   If you'd like to get in touch with me,
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:13.280]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.520]   Twitter @radicalpf, Facebook.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.400]   Thank you for those of you
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.400]   who have joined the Irregulars program.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.400]   Consider joining if you've appreciated the information,
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.160]   if I've helped you save you some money,
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.280]   consider joining the Irregulars.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.600]   Details are at radicalpersonalfinance.com/membership.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.000]   Let's go out with one review here.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.200]   Thank you for those of you who've been leaving me
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.000]   iTunes reviews.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.040]   One review here from Lane.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.760]   He says, "You will learn difficult topics
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.560]   "explained with words, examples, guests,
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.000]   "and other methods as required.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.080]   "You will learn from this one.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.000]   "They're not short or always just a certain number
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.400]   "of minutes, but the adjustment is worth the effort."
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.600]   So another one here from,
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.480]   oh, that one was from me.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.320]   I reviewed my own show.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.400]   I said, "This show is awesome.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.480]   "It really helps make financial stuff make sense."
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.680]   Yes, it is my own show, and that's why it's so good.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.520]   (laughing)
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.520]   So that was me reviewing my own show.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.760]   Thank you for leaving reviews on iTunes and on Stitcher.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.200]   I appreciate it very much,
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.920]   and I wish each and every one of you a lovely day.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.440]   Go out, and if you're running a business,
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.160]   call your accountant and go spend an extra $475,000
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.960]   and keep your money yourself.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.280]   Forget about trying to keep up with the government.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:39.380]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:42.460]   This show is intended to provide entertainment,
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:46.340]   education, and financial enlightenment.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.860]   Your situation is unique,
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.740]   and I cannot deliver any actionable advice
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.300]   without knowing anything about you.
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:59.200]   This show is not and is not intended
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.720]   to be any form of financial advice.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:07.360]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.360]   who you find to be caring, competent, and trustworthy,
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:15.240]   and consult them because they are the ones
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.260]   who can understand your specific needs,
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.100]   your specific goals, and provide specific answers
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.940]   to your questions.
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.940]   Hold them accountable for your results.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.500]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.360]   in today's show, but I'm one person, and I make mistakes.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.260]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said,
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.960]   please come by the show page and comment
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.200]   so we can all learn together.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.540]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
