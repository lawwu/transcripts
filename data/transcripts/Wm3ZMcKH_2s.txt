[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Lindsay writes in to ask, "As I have
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.600]   considered men who desire to marry me,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.600]   pornography and lust continue to
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.600]   resurface as strongholds in the lives of
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.600]   my suitors. I'm seeking to view men with
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   eyes of grace and to use wisdom at the
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   same time. I understand that every sin
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.600]   including lust is a turning away from
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600]   delight in Jesus to a broken cistern.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.600]   In light of this, do you believe it is
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   possible for a man to be strong in
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   faith, finding genuine joy in Jesus and
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.600]   enjoying an overall satisfying
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600]   experience of simultaneously indulging
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600]   frequently in lust? I believe that every
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.600]   sin can be defeated through the power of
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   the Holy Spirit, but I do not want to be
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600]   naive either since I know this issue is
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600]   wide and pervasive. I suppose another
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   way to word my question would be this.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.600]   Pastor John, should the present presence
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600]   of pornography in a man's life be a
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   marriage deal breaker for a single
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600]   woman like me?"
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600]   Wow. I hear at least two questions
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   there and I can't answer the last one.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600]   Is it a deal breaker until I answer a
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600]   couple of others? So let me give you,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600]   when I think about this, here are the
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600]   four questions I'm going to have to
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600]   tackle. One is the very question she
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600]   asked, "Can a man get victory over this?"
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   I mean, shouldn't a man be able to live a
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600]   life of more or less regular triumph
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   instead of recurring over and over again
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600]   to pornography? That's one. Number two, "If
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600]   he can't, is it a deal breaker for her
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   marrying him?" Number three, "What is
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   pornography?" That she didn't ask. I've
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   got to ask it. And even more
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   important, "Why is it wrong?" So let me
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   tackle those real quick. Here's my
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   definition. I'm going to omit homosexual
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   issues. I'm going to omit sex in movies.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   Those are huge issues, but more or less
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   what men are usually dealing with today
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   is involvement with pornography is
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   looking at sexually, say, or
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   fantasizing about nude women other than
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   your wife. I'm just going to, that's what
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   I'm talking about. Okay, looking at or
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   fantasizing about nude women. They might
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   be doing all kinds of stuff or just
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   standing there other than your wife.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   That's my definition. Now here's why I
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   think it's wrong, and I have to say this
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   Tony, because until the guy feels these
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   things that I'm going to say right now
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   about why it's wrong, it won't make any
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   sense to him why she would say, "I can't
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   marry you." These are so big, I'm going to
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   wind up saying, "Woman, you are so right.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   Don't lower your standards." So here's
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   why I think it's wrong. Number one, porn
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   is unloving. It's unloving to the women
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   involved because it endorses their
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   behaviors and their desires, which are
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600]   going to destroy them if they don't
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   repent. It's unloving to their future
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   husbands, and when they are
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   confirming in these women a lifestyle of
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   nudity that is going to be destructive
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   to the future relationships those women
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   are going to try to have someday. It's
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   unloving to the parents of those women. I
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   would just ask men, put yourself in the
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   position of the dad or the mom.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   That's your daughter. How do you feel
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   about that? And here's this Christian guy
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   who's endorsing, approving, helping that
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   happen, and confirming that as if he
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   doesn't give a rip about those parents
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   and their broken heart. Their hearts are
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   broken because of this girl's behavior,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   and this guy doesn't give a rip about
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   whether their hearts are broken. He's
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   enjoying her breaking their heart. So
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   that's number one. It's unloving. The
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   second thing is that porn is adulterous.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   In other words, it cultivates and pursues
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   mental and physical pleasures that are
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   made by God to flourish in marriage, but
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   they're pursued through women other than
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   our wives. So Jesus had very strong words
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   to say about that. Here's the third thing.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   Porn is destructive to a man's capacity
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   to love a woman purely for herself.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   He's training himself. When he
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   does pornography, he's training his body
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   to need increasingly different, strange,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   erotic situations and bodies, and he's
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   making it, therefore, harder to be content
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   with the real body of this woman that's
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   going to be offered to him as his wife.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   And her body, at its best, is not
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   going to be the hairbrushed body of
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   these pornographic sights. And when she's
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   50, it isn't going to be that either. And
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   if he hasn't cultivated a kind of pure
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   love for his wife, for herself, as she is,
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   then his eyes are going to be cruising
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   continually beyond what she has to offer
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   him at 40 and 50 and 60. And a woman
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   needs a man, needs to be able to trust a
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   man. I am what you have. I am what you
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   need. You don't have eyes for another
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   woman. A woman feels profoundly
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   compromised when a man says to her, "No, I
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   really need more than you can
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   offer me." That's tragic for a man to say
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   that to a woman. So porn is destructive
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   to his capacities to love her for who she
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   is. And here's the fourth, and then the
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   last thing I'll say about why it's so
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   wrong for a man to do this. Porn is
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   destructive to a man's soul. His capacity
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   to see God in the purity and the
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   greatness of his glory is shriveled, it's
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   compromised. The soul tends to
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   shrink to the size and the quality of
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   its pleasures. If a man constantly says
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   to his soul, "Adapt yourself now to this
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   low, brief, unclean, selfish pleasure.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Adapt yourself to this soul. Get yourself
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   around this soul. Form yourself around
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   this soul." It will become that small, and
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   a soul that shrinks like that won't be
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   able to make much of God, won't be able
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   to see God, won't be able to delight in
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   God anywhere near like God should be
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   delighted in, in the glorious pleasures
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   that he offers us in his word and in his
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.600]   world. So those are my reasons I would
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   say to this woman, and to all the men who
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   may be listening, why it is so wrong for
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.600]   him to pursue pornography. Now back
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   to her question. She wanted to know,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   "Isn't it possible for a man to be
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   strong enough in faith and to have
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   enough joy in Jesus and have an overall
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   satisfying relationship to him that he
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   could conquer this? Isn't his indulging
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   frequently in lust an undermining?" And my
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   answer is, "She's right. An overall
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   satisfying relationship with Jesus means
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   that Jesus is precious enough so that we
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   value him above those four reasons. Those
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   four reasons that I gave why
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   porn is wrong become compelling. If Jesus
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   is our treasure, not just a doctrine, but
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   his Lord and friend and Savior and
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   supreme treasure of our lives the way he
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   should be, then we won't be continually
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   hating women with our choices to demean
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   them and confirm their destruction. We
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   won't be continually committing adultery
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   in our heart with those women. We won't
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   be continually defiling our capacity to
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   love our present or future wives. We
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   won't be continually shrinking our soul's
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   ability to savor the glories of God. We
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   won't because Jesus is so utterly
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   different than that. A man who
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   continually says, "I embrace all that
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   destruction. I embrace all that evil. I
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   embrace all that uncleanness. I embrace
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.600]   all that idolatry and that hatred for
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   women," is saying something that a woman
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   who's about to marry him better hear
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   loud and clear. So my answer to her last
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   question, Tony, is should it be a deal-breaker
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   if this man can't get victory over this?
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   If he is regularly tuning in? I would say,
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   "Yeah, that's a deal-breaker. I'm not a
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   woman, and so I can't make this, you know,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   call for myself." I would just say, "If I
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   were her, I would say, 'You strike me as a
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   woman of remarkable grace, not legalism.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   You strike me as a woman who is
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   striving for biblical standards, not
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   artificial and unrealistic and
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   perfectionistic standards. I hear grace
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   in your question. I don't hear
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   brittleness, and I would say, 'Don't lower
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   the bar.'" I think we've lowered the bar
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   too much. We've treated men like dogs in
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   heat, rather than men who are created in
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   the image of God, who have the Holy
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   Spirit, whose fruit is love, joy, and
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   self-control. And that last one,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   anchortia, self-control, is usually used
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   in relationship to sexuality. Men are not
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   victims, and these women have a right to
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   expect more from us, and so I would say
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   to her and to the other women, "Don't
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   lower your standards. God is in the
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   process, I believe, right now, purifying
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   a man's soul and a man's body for you."
