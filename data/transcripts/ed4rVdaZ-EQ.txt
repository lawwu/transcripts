[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   There are few more perplexing questions of the Bible than this.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.640]   If he knew that he would betray him in the end, why did Jesus choose Judas as a disciple
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.880]   to begin with?
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.800]   The perplexing question comes in specifically from a podcast listener named Austin.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.120]   "Hello Pastor John, I've been studying through the book of John lately and I began
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.520]   to wonder why Jesus chose Judas to be one of his disciples in the first place and what
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.480]   does Jesus have to teach us by choosing someone to be his disciple knowing full well he would
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.560]   betray him?
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.880]   Are there any takeaways for us in this?"
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:51.740]   John 6.64 says, "Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe and who
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.440]   it was who would betray him."
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.940]   So Austin's question is biblically based and urgent.
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.600]   Jesus chose his own betrayer to be part of his apostles.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600]   Why?
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   I'm going to give five answers that I see in the scriptures for why God ordained and
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.160]   Jesus chose Judas, the betrayer, to be part of his team.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.440]   First, because the Old Testament scriptures prophesied that this would take place.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.320]   So Jesus chose Judas to fulfill the scriptures.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.720]   John 13.18, Jesus says to his apostles, "I am not speaking of all of you.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.240]   I know whom I have chosen, but the scripture will be fulfilled."
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:57.160]   And then he quotes Psalm 41.9, "He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me."
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.600]   And Peter, on the day of Pentecost, Acts 1.16 says, "Brothers, the scripture had to be fulfilled
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.160]   concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus."
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.080]   Step by step, Jesus moved toward the cross, taking pains to fulfill every scripture concerning
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.840]   his death, right down to the details of how he would be handed over.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.200]   The point was to show the scriptures cannot be broken and God is in control.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:43.800]   Second, by choosing to be betrayed by a close friend and even by a kiss, Jesus shows us
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.040]   that the most despicable act in the history of the world, the betrayal and consequent
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.000]   murder of the Son of God, was part of God's saving plan.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.800]   It's explicitly said in Acts 4.27 that by his hand and his predestination, these things
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.160]   took place.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.800]   In other words, the lesson of Judas is that the most horrible sins in the world are used
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   by God for his saving purposes.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.920]   Just when people think they're getting the upper hand, they find that their hand is serving
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.720]   the very one they are opposing.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.080]   It's a great lesson for us to learn.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.720]   Third, by choosing from the beginning an apostle who was destined for apostasy and destruction,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.960]   and by including him in his closest relations, and by giving him power over unclean spirits
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:58.480]   and over diseases, Jesus shows us that religious associations and religious practices and miracle
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.800]   working are no sure evidence of being born again.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.640]   Matthew 10, verses 1 to 4, describe the choosing of the twelve.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.400]   It names Judas and says, "Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast out
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.040]   and to heal every disease and every affliction."
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:34.420]   Judas walked with Jesus, ministered with Jesus for three years, and he worked those miracles.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.720]   So Judas becomes a vivid illustration of the people in Matthew 7.22.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.340]   On that day, many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.920]   cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name?"
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.180]   That's Judas and many, many other people in history.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.240]   And then Jesus will declare to them, "I never knew you.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.160]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness."
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.520]   What a vivid lesson to learn that right doctrine, "Lord, Lord"—we know who you are.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   We got our doctrine right—"Lord, Lord"—and religious activity and miracle working.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.800]   We've cast out demons.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.640]   We've healed people.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.080]   Prove nothing about saving faith and being born again.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.800]   That's the lesson of Judas.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.680]   Fourth, Judas serves as an illustration that predestination and human responsibility go
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.840]   hand in hand.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.480]   Judas' destiny was set before his betrayal.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:54.920]   Jesus said that he kept all his disciples from apostasy except Judas, the son of destruction,
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.480]   John 17, 12.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:06.080]   In John 6, 64, it says, "Jesus knew from the beginning who it was who would betray
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.440]   him."
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.920]   And then Jesus explains in the next verse, "This is why I told you that no one can come
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.560]   to me unless it is granted to him by the Father."
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:30.180]   In other words, Judas didn't repent because it was not granted to him by the Father.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:40.280]   His destiny was sealed, and yet he was guilty—really guilty, really accountable, really blameworthy.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.800]   He was really responsible for what he did.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.200]   He himself said in Matthew 27, 4, "I have sinned.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.920]   I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.600]   So we learn from Judas not to stumble over the fact that a person may be destined for
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:07.120]   destruction and yet totally responsible for what he does.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:15.480]   And finally, number five, Judas serves as a vivid example of the terrible, terrible
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:24.800]   power of the love of money and how it blinds us to what is true and beautiful and valuable
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.360]   in this world.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:39.480]   In John 12, 4 to 6, when Mary anointed Jesus, Judas said, oozing with hypocrisy, "Why
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.400]   was this ointment not sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor?"
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:52.480]   And John comments, "He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:08:01.680]   a thief, and having the charge of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.280]   in it."
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:11.240]   Under the nose of the very Son of God, who would give his life as a ransom for many,
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:19.640]   whose teachings he had heard for three years, in whose power he did miracles, Judas loved
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.400]   money more than he loved Jesus.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.800]   That's horrific, unbelievable, unspeakably evil.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:37.360]   It should make every one of us tremble at the thought of the power that money has in
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   our lives to blind us to what is true and beautiful and precious.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:51.680]   So when Judas got his chance, 30 pieces of silver is all it took to sell the very Son
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680]   of God.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:09:00.760]   I'm sure there are more answers to Austin's question, but these are at least five answers
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:07.600]   that I see in the Bible as to why God would ordain and Jesus would choose that a betrayer
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.040]   be included among the apostles from the beginning.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.760]   One, to fulfill Scripture.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.560]   Scriptures cannot be broken, and God is in control.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:23.960]   Two, even horrific sins serve the saving purposes of God in his sovereign plan.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:31.840]   Three, time with Jesus and miracle working are no proof of saving faith.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.040]   Four, predestination and human accountability go hand in hand.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.800]   And five, the love of money is behind the worst sin in the world.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   Amen.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.240]   John 12 is an incredible text for a lot of reasons.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.760]   Mary pouring out her wealth on the feet of Jesus reminds me of APJ 1499 titled, "What
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.280]   Does Freedom from the Love of Money Look Like?"
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.000]   Freedom from the love of money looks like Mary at the feet of Jesus.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   One of my all-time favorite APJ episodes.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Check that out.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.760]   APJ 1499 on what it looks like to be free from the love of money.
