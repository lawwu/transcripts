[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   - The biggest piece of advice that I still struggle
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.240]   to take every day, every time I have though,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.960]   it's had profound impact on my life, is to focus.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.860]   Every time I focused and avoided distractions,
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.820]   it's made a huge impact.
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.220]   I think that everyone assumes that there's this power law
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.140]   in the world that you are a passive participant in.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.160]   You're either going to catch one of the power law winners
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.340]   or you're going to lose it.
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.160]   Therefore, you've got to portfolio your way
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.800]   to a power law, to catch a power law.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.560]   I don't give a shit about that because I think my job in life
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.120]   is to make the power law and to make that outcome.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.280]   And I feel like that has made a huge impact
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.440]   on how I think about life.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.960]   Every time I've tried to act on it,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.200]   it's actually paid back significantly.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.560]   So focus is the biggest piece of advice I've gotten
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.400]   that I think matters.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.240]   Seven samurai.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.640]   Akira Kurosawa did such an amazing job
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.320]   representing this ethos, I think.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.180]   You strike and you strike perfectly
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.320]   and you strike with full force and with all your energy
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.440]   and everything you have, your whole character, everything,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.440]   and you can accomplish incredible things.
