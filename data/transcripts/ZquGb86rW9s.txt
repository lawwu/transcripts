[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   When it comes to suffering and pain,
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.240]   none of us are immune.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.720]   And that pain so often seems pointless,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.440]   but in fact, pain in our lives is not pointless.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   So what does our suffering produce?
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.400]   What is it doing in our lives?
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   John Piper addressed this question in his 2013 sermon,
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.160]   The Glory of God in the Sight of Eternity.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.400]   He addressed 2 Corinthians 4, verses 16 to 18,
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.360]   and I'll read it to orient us in this episode.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.640]   Quote, "So we do not lose heart,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.040]   though our outer self is wasting away,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.080]   our inner self is being renewed day by day.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.500]   For this light momentary affliction
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.600]   is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840]   beyond all comparison,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.960]   as we look not to the things that are seen,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.340]   but to the things that are unseen.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.740]   For the things that are seen are transient,
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.140]   but the things that are unseen are eternal."
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.100]   Here's John Piper.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.520]   - I'll tell you, I was talking to a woman the other day
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.900]   about this issue who struggles with assurance in her life.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.120]   And I said, "You know, God designed your heart
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.420]   to experience the sweetness of assurance
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.400]   by what you focus on with your head."
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460]   And she looked at me like, "Where's that?
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.040]   Where's that?"
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.880]   And I went here.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.960]   She's like, "That sounded new to her.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.800]   Where's that?"
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.400]   I thought, "What do you mean?"
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.040]   That's all the Bible is,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.360]   is a bunch of therefores and becauses,
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.160]   talking about peace and joy and strength and power
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.120]   and for reasons that God has revealed in his word
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.080]   and acted out in history.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.400]   So Paul really does experience not losing heart
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.040]   because of truths, realities that he puts into his head
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.560]   day by day, day by day for renewal.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.800]   Now, what about the four at the beginning of verse 17?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Like we're gonna beat verse 16 to death if we don't move on.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.720]   But my, there's a lot of life in there.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.560]   He doesn't give up easy.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.680]   I love to pound on verse 17.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.480]   Pound on verses till they're dead.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.480]   That's an odd way to say it, isn't it?
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.760]   Okay, verse 17.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.920]   Verse 16, we don't lose heart.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.860]   We're gonna be renewed every day.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.860]   For, because this light momentary affliction
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.760]   is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.720]   beyond all comparison as we look not to the things
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.560]   that are seen but to the things that are unseen
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.320]   for the things that are seen are transient
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.840]   but the things that are unseen are eternal.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.000]   Verse 17 is the main argument.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.400]   It's the main because, the main thing.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.600]   This light momentary affliction is doing something.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.520]   It's working for us an eternal weight of glory.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   All verse 18 does is say look at it.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.160]   You can't see it but look at it.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.440]   If you look at the fallenness of man coming at you
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.080]   with his guns or the fallenness of nature
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.680]   coming at you with its tsunamis,
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.380]   all you're gonna do is lose heart.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.080]   Stop looking at that.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.720]   Look at the unseen.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.560]   You gotta say what unseen are you talking about?
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.960]   And how do you look at something that's unseen?
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.120]   That's a contradiction.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.400]   Can't look at what you can't look at.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.840]   You said it's unseen, stop telling me to see it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.560]   So what do you mean Paul?
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.320]   And I think it comes pretty clear what he means.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.680]   That the basis of our not losing heart
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.240]   is something you can't see.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.120]   And I'll get at what that is in just a minute.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   How do you look at the unseen
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.840]   so as to not lose heart
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.480]   and so as to be renewed every day?
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.960]   And verse 17 is the main unseen thing you look at.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.440]   We do not lose heart because this light,
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.880]   momentary affliction is preparing for us
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.400]   an eternal weight of glory.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.040]   Look at this, he says, look at this.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.000]   What do you see when you look at verse 17?
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   You see him calling his affliction,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.700]   which lasted a lifetime, momentary.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.000]   Paul, you realize I'm 67,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.760]   people are supposed, you're supposed to retire, right?
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.320]   Paul suffered until the sword
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.360]   severed his head from his body.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.160]   There was no year or two of fishing.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.440]   [audience laughing]
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   Or golf.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.680]   If Paul was gonna have a retirement,
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.800]   it would be post-beheading.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.920]   [audience laughing]
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.320]   So if he didn't have this, he had nothing.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.560]   He said, if there's no resurrection from the dead,
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.240]   I'm an idiot.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.280]   That's what he said, 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.640]   He called his lifelong beatings
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.680]   and shipwreck and sleepless nights
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.440]   and agony for the church, he called it momentary.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.560]   You see that there in verse 17?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.680]   This light, momentary, he called it light
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.360]   and he called it momentary.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.340]   That's crazy.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.160]   That's not what you see.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.240]   You look at it, you say, 60 years.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.480]   50, I'm not sure how old he was when he died.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.600]   Long time, 20, 30 years of relentless
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.520]   imprisonments and persecution.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.720]   And he calls it momentary and he calls it light.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.920]   And you see also, don't you, the contrast
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.480]   between momentary in verse 17 is eternal
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.680]   and the contrast with light is weight.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.760]   So let's read it again, notice those parallels.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.680]   His light, momentary affliction is preparing for him
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.720]   an eternal, that corresponds to momentary,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.760]   weight, that corresponds to light, of glory.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.440]   So he could see, see?
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.340]   See, really?
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.740]   You can't see, but he saw beyond the grave,
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.800]   according to promise, he saw glory.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.080]   The glory of God that would be seen
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.480]   and the glory of God that would be given to him.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.780]   And it made his lifelong suffering look momentary
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.180]   and it made the weight of the pain look light.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.180]   Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden,
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.540]   and I will give you rest.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.260]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.620]   for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.500]   You are kidding me.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.100]   You gotta die for Jesus.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.380]   You're gonna call that light?
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.220]   Yes.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.060]   Why?
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.300]   Because I look to the unseen.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.120]   What?
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.540]   Glory.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.340]   Glory beyond the grave that's gonna so make up
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.420]   for this brief life.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.700]   It will look momentary and it will look light.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.140]   That's the unseen you gotta look at.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.740]   One more thing.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.100]   So relevant for so many suffering people
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.100]   and so precious to me.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.100]   This word in verse 17, preparing, preparing.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:09.860]   Not only is all your affliction momentary,
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.860]   not only is all your affliction light
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.440]   in comparison to eternity and the glory there,
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.100]   but all of it is totally meaningful.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.460]   Now that is a very controversial statement
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.420]   because of how much insane suffering there is in the world.
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.740]   Every time something horrific happens,
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.540]   an interviewer will say, "Meaningless."
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.180]   And that is what it looks like.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.580]   It's everywhere.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.580]   Now we've got the internet,
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.340]   we've got no excuse for not crying every day.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.700]   Weep for those who weep, right?
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.480]   This text says our light momentary affliction
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:02.160]   is preparing for us an eternal weight.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.560]   It doesn't say we'll be followed by
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.120]   an eternal weight of glory.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.440]   That would be good enough.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.160]   That would be good enough.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.200]   That's not what it says.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.280]   Kat ergod zomai, forgive the Greek, I just love it.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.520]   Got to like dump it out every now and then.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.900]   You don't need to know that.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.460]   The word means produce, prepare, cause to bring about.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.080]   I'll venture this.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.080]   Every millisecond of your pain
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.920]   from the fallen nature or fallen man,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   every millisecond of your misery in the path of obedience
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.960]   is producing a peculiar glory you will get
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.000]   because of that.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.480]   That's a very controversial statement and I believe it.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.160]   So that if anybody says to me
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.200]   that a believer's suffering was meaningless,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   I'll be quiet probably because they're hurting really bad
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.760]   right now and I'm gonna wait and see
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.680]   when the right time is.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.720]   But I'm gonna come back eventually and say,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.780]   it wasn't meaningless.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.320]   I don't care if it was cancer or criticism.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.720]   I don't care if it was slander or sickness.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.240]   It wasn't meaningless because verse 17 says,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   my light, momentary, lifelong, total affliction
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.600]   is doing something.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.960]   It's doing something.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   It's not meaningless.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   Of course you can't see what it's doing.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.280]   This is the main unseen thing.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.360]   Verse 18's talking about I think.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.320]   What's the unseen you're supposed to look at?
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.200]   You're supposed to look at the promise of God
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.120]   in verse 17 that says,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.720]   your pain is doing something for you.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.000]   You can't see it, you can't feel it.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.400]   Either you see it with the eyes of faith,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.600]   believe it 'cause the text says it,
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.200]   or you lose heart.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.600]   - That's magnificent truth to ground our lives
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.360]   when the pain hits.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.160]   This also reminds me of episode number 639,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.680]   A Song for Sufferers,
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.920]   which you can find in our archive
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.360]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.600]   That's episode number 639, A Song for Sufferers.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.380]   For this clip, thank you Caleb Lee in San Francisco.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.880]   He found it in a John Piper sermon titled
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.280]   The Glory of God in the Sight of Eternity,
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.560]   preached back on July 26, 2013.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.560]   Caleb, thank you for sending the sermon clip in.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.160]   You can send those in to us via email
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.840]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.080]   Send us the name of the sermon and the timestamp
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.680]   of when and where the clip appears in the audio,
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.640]   hopefully somewhere between five to eight minutes of a clip.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.120]   And we will give you credit for the find, of course.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.160]   Tomorrow, a listener wants to know
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.040]   if the Holy Kiss has passed out of practice in churches.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   And if so, is that good, is it bad,
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.880]   and what did the original practice represent?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.380]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:31.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
