[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   The following is a conversation with Mark Normand,
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.320]   a New York comedian who has a way with words
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.400]   that is often both dark and hilarious.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.400]   Let that be a warning, dear friends,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.520]   to proceed with caution and to wear protection.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.160]   You may, in fact, need it.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.360]   He has a special on his YouTube called "Out to Lunch"
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.160]   and a new special on Netflix
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.880]   as part of the "Stand Up" season three series
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.040]   I recommend you watch.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.160]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.360]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.520]   in the description.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.440]   And now, here's my conversation with Mark Normand.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.520]   I asked Tim Dillon about Bukowski first,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.360]   so let me continue on that tradition
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.200]   and ask you about something
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.640]   that Charles Bukowski said about love.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.120]   - Wait, are we rolling?
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.940]   - Yes.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.480]   - Oh, geez, no hello, no nothing.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.080]   - Nope. - I thought I was robotic.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.640]   (laughing)
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.840]   - Bukowski said, "Love is a fog that burns away
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200]   "with the first daylight of reality."
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   So, Mark Normand, let me first ask you about love.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.880]   What are your thoughts about love?
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.320]   You talk about your relationships quite a bit.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.680]   Do you think love can last?
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.800]   - I do, but I think it's work.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.560]   Everybody wants love to be this pre-packaged,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.940]   perfect, euphoric thing, but you gotta,
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.200]   it's like a good body, you know?
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.660]   We're all born with a good body,
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.000]   but you gotta keep it in shape,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.880]   and it's the same with a loving relationship.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.400]   - I think you--
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.240]   - Nobody wants to do the work, that's the problem.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.480]   - You talked about, I think you told a story
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.320]   about being unfaithful to a previous girlfriend
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.720]   or something like that.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   I think the story goes that you were drifting apart.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.280]   Who were you talking to, Bert Kreischer maybe
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.120]   or something like that?
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.080]   - Oh, yeah, we were high school sweethearts,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.780]   dated for 12 years, and then--
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.080]   - So, that wasn't love anymore.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.640]   That was more like relationship, that was like--
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.360]   - It was comfort, it was routine,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.000]   and we just slipped into that married life,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   autopilot world, and I tried to break up, I think,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.400]   and it didn't take, it was one of those things.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.500]   Our lives were just so baked in,
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.680]   and then I think I cheated, and she caught me,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.760]   and it was ugly, and then we went to therapy
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.520]   to try to work it out, but it's much like a car
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.760]   that gets into a wreck, the door just never closes the same.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.480]   - Yeah, so what are your thoughts about then commitment,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.720]   like outside of love, marriage?
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.480]   - I think it's an antiquated idea.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.640]   I think it's kind of silly and unrealistic,
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.880]   and I think we're coming out of that.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.360]   As we get all polyamorous and non-binary and queefy
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.120]   and all this stuff, I think we're slowly moving away
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.240]   from that, but I think a lot of the ladies,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.400]   more majority women like marriage, like the idea of it.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.640]   Like, I'm a fiance now, or whatever you call it.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.920]   I'm engaged, and I mean, she is just,
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.560]   woo-wee, going hog wild.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.400]   She's loving it.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.720]   She's got the dress thing, pick a venue, flower,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.560]   and she's deep in, whereas I feel guilty,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.180]   'cause I'm just like, ah, jeez.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.600]   - Is it planned already?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.440]   When's the wedding?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.260]   - You see "Squid Game"?
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.880]   I'm just living life.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.560]   Yeah, it's planned.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.400]   It's in New Orleans.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.980]   I'm from there, and it's next year.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.880]   Are you married?
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.760]   - No, single.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.320]   - Virgin?
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.160]   - Of course, yeah.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.980]   - I can't imagine.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.880]   I bet you'd be great in bed.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.720]   You're ripped.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.520]   You'd be the best hairline in podcasting.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.360]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.760]   I haven't tried yet, so we'll have to see.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.840]   - All right, well, let me know.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   Pretty big hog on you?
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   Yeah, I could see you packing a crazy, crazy tool downtown.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.280]   - That matters to girls?
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.240]   - Apparently, yeah.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.440]   That's all I hear about.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.720]   - Okay, New Orleans.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.780]   You grew up in New Orleans?
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.280]   - Yeah, born and raised.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.640]   Treme, outside the French Quarter.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.480]   - You ever been?
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.520]   - Yeah, don't remember it.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.640]   - Oh, you drink?
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.480]   - Yeah, I drink.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.300]   Of course I drink.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.140]   - I don't know.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.960]   I can't tell if you have fun.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.480]   - No, not really, but Russian, of course I drink vodka,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.320]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.140]   - Oh, you're Russian.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.980]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.820]   - Yes.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.640]   - I don't know.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.480]   - Vodka.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   Beer was just labeled an alcoholic beverage in 2011.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.440]   Fun fact.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.280]   - What do you mean?
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.400]   - In Russia.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.320]   It was just drinks.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.840]   It was just like apple juice before.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.120]   It finally got declared legally as an alcoholic beverage.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.400]   Which means you can regulate it, that kind of thing.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.520]   - I guess so.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.360]   - Yeah.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.180]   - See, that's where your brain goes.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.860]   - I just go, oh, these fucking Russkies are--
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.520]   - I didn't even know there was rules about drinking.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.360]   This is good.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.600]   I'm learning about Russia from you.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.960]   So what's the difficult memory experience from childhood
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   in New Orleans that made you the man you are today?
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.840]   - I don't know if it made me the man, but jeez.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.860]   I had a lot of scuffles in the neighborhood.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.400]   I was the white kid in the neighborhood.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.000]   So I was automatically the odd man out,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.840]   the minority, the weirdo, the dork, the dweeb, the honky.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.400]   So just a lot of memories of getting slapped in the face
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.320]   by guys and just having to take it
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.840]   'cause there's five guys there.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.880]   And they'd be like, oh, look, you didn't even fight back.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.240]   And you're like, well, what am I gonna do?
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.880]   Hit you and then get beat up by these guys?
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.160]   So a lot of that stuff was a big bummer growing up.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160]   Got robbed all the time.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.060]   Lost a lot of bicycles.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.420]   Had a bicycle taken from under me.
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.420]   That was pretty brutal.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.160]   These kids pulled up.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   They're like 17 and I was 13 and I had a face paint on.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.200]   Like I had a, not black face, but I was at a summer camp
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.440]   and I had a rainbow face painted on me.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.040]   We were helping kids that day.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.440]   So I let them put paint on me.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.020]   And so now I'm riding home.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.940]   What a mark, what a goober I am.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.000]   I'm riding home and these guys see me a mile away.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.080]   I'm a sitting duck and they go,
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.920]   we can take his bike.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.000]   He's got a fucking rainbow on his cheek.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.720]   So they just go, hey, like cut in front of you.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.760]   They go, let me try your bike.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.120]   I go, I'm good, I'm good.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.480]   I knew what they wanted.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.240]   And they go, let me try the bike.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.400]   And then they just pushed me and took the bike.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.160]   So stuff like that was really shaping the insecurity,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.000]   the self-worth.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.360]   - They did, 'cause I've been mugged when I was younger too.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.400]   - Really?
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.680]   - Yeah, it changes your view of human nature a little bit.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.760]   - For sure, you go, wow,
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.240]   I didn't know people could be this mean, this cruel.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.280]   Inconsiderate, I'm always worried about it.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.400]   Did I fart too much?
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.560]   Am I annoying?
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.820]   Am I pissing this guy off?
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.560]   But what a way to live.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.360]   Just I want the bike, I'm taking it.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.040]   Fuck his feelings.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.600]   - For me, that quickly turned into realizing
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.640]   that that's just a temporary phase that those folks are in.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.960]   Like they have a capacity to be good.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.800]   - Sure.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.240]   - For some reason, for me,
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.800]   that was a motivation to see can we discover,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   can we incentivize them to find a better path in life?
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.320]   I wasn't all, I don't know, Gandhi about it.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.520]   Of course, I was pissed and all those kinds of things,
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   but I don't know, it seemed like just the kind of thing
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.420]   you might do when you're younger.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.780]   - You hope, but this is adult crime, obviously.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.320]   - Yeah, I know, but yeah, exactly.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.760]   And then it solidifies,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.720]   and then you're beyond saving at some point.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.080]   But it's like there's always an opportunity
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.840]   to make a better life for yourself,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.920]   to become a better version of yourself.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.600]   - Yeah, and I remember coming home crying with no bike,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   and my mom, my parents are like liberal to a fault.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.440]   - Yeah.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.840]   - Where they were like, oh, well, they need it.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.640]   They're poor kids in the neighborhood.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   And you're like, all right.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.280]   But I also have a bicycle that I ride around,
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.640]   and I also like to live in an area that's not just riddled
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.040]   with theft and vandalism, but they were just like,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.160]   ah, they need it, and then it was a moot point.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   We just moved on.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.600]   So I remember very young being like,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.740]   all right, I gotta figure my shit out.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.560]   - Okay, so you said you were beat up quite a bit,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.620]   like bullying and stuff?
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.000]   - Pushed around, I was never hospitalized or anything,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.440]   but you get a black guy here and there,
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.240]   and a bloody nose, stuff like that.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.960]   And it was just the outnumbered thing.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.200]   The violence didn't really bother me,
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.280]   'cause you're just kids, you're boys.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.400]   But it was the predatory, let's get him.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.960]   We can take him down.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.860]   He's an easy target.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.320]   That's what kills you, the mental part.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.240]   - Yeah, until you actually said that, I didn't realize.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.380]   I've been in, what do you call them, scuffles.
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.200]   And there's just one that stands out to me where--
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.640]   - Let's hear it, fatty, bring it on.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.960]   And you do jujitsu and all that stuff, right?
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.960]   - Yeah, I can see the guns through the suit,
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.120]   you're like John Wick.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.680]   - All right, well, I used to have,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.960]   now you're gonna start making fun of me,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.360]   I used to have long hair for a couple years.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.620]   I was in a band, playing music and stuff like that.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.880]   And there was, most of the fights I've been in
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.000]   were basically one-on-one, maybe a little bit,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.760]   a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.700]   And this one particular time,
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.080]   I've learned a lot of lessons, but one of them was,
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.200]   there was a fight started between me and this other person,
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.360]   and then his buddies, I guess, were there.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.000]   And they, as opposed to breaking it up
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   or letting it happen, one of them grabbed my hair.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.400]   It's the first time anybody grabbed,
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.800]   used my hair in a fight, which I've since then realized
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.440]   that that's actually a really powerful grip
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.680]   and a powerful weapon.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.160]   - Oh, very vulnerable of you.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.600]   - And then my head got pulled back
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.840]   and they pulled me down to the ground.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.480]   I couldn't do anything, it was so,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.960]   I remember being exceptionally frustrated.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.400]   - Yes. - That was the feeling,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.360]   like, I can't do anything here, I'm trapped.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.800]   And then they were just kicking me and hitting me
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   and stuff like that.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.500]   The outnumbered part of it,
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.480]   'cause I always remember the trapped part
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.800]   because I just hated, from a fighting,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.720]   grappling perspective, how, the feeling was,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   this isn't fair.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.960]   - Yes, that's what it is.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.200]   It's a deep, deep unfairness that you just can't win.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.520]   The mob wins.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.800]   - Yeah, the mob wins.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.520]   - Scary stuff, but it makes a man out of you
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.840]   in a weird way that builds character.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.720]   You realize life isn't fair early and you go on from there.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.960]   So there's something there.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.020]   And look at you today.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.080]   They're probably eating out of a dumpster at a Krispy Kreme
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.320]   and you're here, got eight podcasts,
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.720]   you're doing great, talking to giant titans of the industry.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.560]   - No, I do remember returning home that night.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.620]   I mean, that, you said you were crying.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.200]   That's really formative.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.400]   - Oh yeah. - That's the point
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.480]   at which you get to decide, what do I make of this moment?
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.520]   Especially when you're younger,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.760]   maybe it's not presented to you that way,
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.520]   but some of the greatest people in history
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.240]   were bullied in these kinds of ways.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.160]   And they made something of themselves in this moment.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.560]   Bullied by life in some kind of way.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.400]   It's like an opportunity for growth.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.160]   It's weird, but hardship, even in small doses,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.080]   is like an opportunity for growth.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.520]   - Totally, I mean, look at Richard Pryor.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.600]   They say he's labeled as the best comedian of all time.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.720]   Grew up in a whorehouse,
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.800]   watched his mom get plowed by these guys
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.880]   in the middle of Indiana, I wanna say.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.720]   And just, who had a harder life?
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.040]   Who would suck dick for drugs?
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.520]   All this stuff growing up, beat up.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.320]   And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.360]   that's my birth control alarm.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.800]   And then the whole world is trying to get rid of bullying,
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.640]   but we still do bullying, but now it's accepted bullying.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.920]   It's very strange.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.120]   - So you're a proponent of beating kids up,
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.960]   is that what you're saying?
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.520]   - Yes, and sex with them.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.800]   - All right.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.600]   - But no, I just think it's part of life
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.400]   and it's horrible, it's like rain.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.240]   You gotta have it.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.440]   Look, a rainy day's a bummer, you know, but you need it.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.840]   And I think it's similar to that.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.040]   - What was your relationship like with your mom and your dad?
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.880]   What are some memorable moments with them?
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.000]   What did you learn from them?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.440]   - Good parents.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.400]   They're giving, thoughtful.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.680]   A little out to lunch, you know, they were workaholics.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.600]   So it was hard to get a lot out of them.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.520]   And my dad was kind of an angry dad.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.320]   I think he just had like a weird childhood
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.440]   and he's just trying to make it
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.800]   and he's trying to provide, but it's hard.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   And we live in this horrible neighborhood
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.700]   and we're getting robbed all the time.
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.400]   So life was kind of coming down on him all the time.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.880]   So then he'll take it out on you or whoever, he would snap.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.180]   But great parents, they cared, they put us first.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.920]   But there wasn't a lot of,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.240]   I don't know, you ever go to a friend's house as a kid
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   and there's like a picture of a ski trip
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.800]   and you're like, ski trip?
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.640]   What the hell is that about?
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.480]   It wasn't a lot of that.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.520]   And smart, very smart people,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.680]   but I don't know how well they were at socializing.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.240]   - So you never like bonded with them
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.840]   like on a deep human level?
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.640]   - There was some bonding, but rarely deep.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.320]   Yeah, it was just almost coworker.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.360]   - Hey, cold out, huh?
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.200]   - What?
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.320]   - It's cold out, huh?
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   - Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, gotcha.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.360]   - Get there a little bit, but my parents,
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.720]   and I hope they never hear this,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.240]   but they would do a thing where,
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.920]   my dad especially would do a thing where he would,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.440]   he knew how to cut you down right to the bone.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.980]   And so after a while you're like,
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.240]   I'm not even gonna interact with this guy
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.020]   'cause he can get you so well.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.320]   One time we were at like a Thanksgiving,
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.520]   some kind of family event and all the cousins are there.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.880]   And I remember I was holding court.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.280]   I was a young boy finding my comedic legs
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.720]   in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.180]   And I was killing.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.000]   And my dad comes out and he goes,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.640]   "What are you holding court?"
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.200]   And I was like, "Ah."
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.600]   And I felt like I was this big.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.180]   I just shrunk down.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.100]   He just nailed it.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.940]   'Cause in my head I'm like,
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.880]   "I'm holding court, look at me.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.720]   "I got the whole room."
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.000]   And he goes, "What are you holding court here?"
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.560]   And I'm like, "Who the hell do you think you are?"
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.120]   And I was like, "He's right.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.960]   "I shouldn't be holding court.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.800]   "Who the fuck am I?
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.620]   "I'm nobody."
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.560]   So stuff like that.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.680]   - Was he aware of that you think?
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.720]   - He wasn't, he wasn't.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.280]   I don't think he was, but.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.240]   - Do you give parents a pass
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.400]   when they're unaware of the destructive?
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.560]   Like is it better when they're unaware?
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.160]   'Cause it seems like that's the way.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.000]   - That's true.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.920]   - That's the way parents often fail
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.260]   is they're not intentionally malevolent.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.160]   They're just like clueless.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.200]   - Yeah.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.800]   It's a bittersweet thing.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.280]   'Cause you're like, "Well, okay, he's not malicious.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.980]   "He's not trying to hurt me,
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.940]   "but also he doesn't know he hurt me."
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.260]   I don't know, it's tough.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.660]   'Cause if he was trying to hurt you,
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.460]   I guess that would be worse.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.540]   - So you're the fully baked Mark Norman cake at this point.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.880]   - Yeah, it's a shitty cake.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.820]   - Do you--
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.380]   - Fruit salad.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.880]   - You know, the sense of self-worth you mentioned.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.980]   I think in your comedy,
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.900]   there's a sense like you hate yourself.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:53.740]   - You think?
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.560]   (laughing)
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.400]   I didn't know if that came through.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.420]   Shit, I was trying to hide that part.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.320]   God damn it.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.580]   - I mean, when you, in the privacy of your mind,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:07.300]   are you able to love yourself or is it mostly self-hate?
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.020]   - Jeez, what happened to this podcast?
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.140]   I didn't know it was on Dr. Phil.
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:11.980]   - Dr. Phil.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.620]   - I thought we were gonna talk about engineering
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.180]   and climate change and rockets.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.020]   - We'll get there.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.840]   - Okay.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.060]   - "Stars with Love" goes to rockets.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.260]   - All right, I like that.
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.460]   I like that's a T-shirt.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.540]   I mean, like--
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.380]   - What's the question?
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.220]   Sorry.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.040]   (laughing)
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.100]   Do I feel love?
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.940]   - No, no, like--
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.180]   - I love myself.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:37.020]   So are you, like this engine of being self-critical,
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.700]   of just being constantly anxious
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.940]   about how the world perceives you, these kinds of things,
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.240]   is this something that you just go to for comedy
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.180]   or is this who you are as a human being?
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.100]   - I think I don't wanna explore it.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.140]   I think I get around it.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.360]   You know, I tap dance around it,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.940]   but I get it out a little with my act, maybe,
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.380]   'cause I can't do it.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.580]   I'm not doing it in real life.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.780]   So I'll get out this no love, not loving myself.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.140]   I don't know, who wants to love themself?
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.520]   Everybody always, you gotta love yourself,
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.100]   and then when you meet somebody who does love yourself,
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.340]   you're like, I fucking hate this guy.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.700]   Don't you hate the guy who's upset?
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.220]   I'm great, I'm awesome, life is good.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.140]   You're like, ah, this guy sucks.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.980]   I'd rather an insecure guy.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.220]   So maybe I wanna stay insecure.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.820]   Maybe I don't wanna find this love for myself.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.500]   - Well, okay, so self-love,
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.900]   like just appreciating who you are
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.140]   or appreciating the moment or being grateful
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.140]   doesn't have to express itself
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.820]   by the guy saying, I'm awesome.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.640]   - True.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.660]   - It's more just like humility.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.460]   It's just like walking calmly through the world
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.540]   and just being grateful to be alive, that kind of thing.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.260]   And just-- - That's good.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.580]   - And being appreciative of all the accomplishments
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.420]   that you made so far.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.220]   I say all this because mostly I'm extremely self-critical
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.460]   in everything I do.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.220]   And so, and I kinda enjoy it.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.180]   I think it's a nice little engine that it makes it fun.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.140]   It makes life fun 'cause it's like,
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.020]   if you hate everything you do,
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.220]   like you've done in the past,
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.540]   that gives you like, all right, we can do better.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.500]   - Yes, but that's the key is making yourself critical.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.660]   Always trying to get better.
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.980]   I could change this, I could tweak this,
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.300]   I could improve this.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.500]   When you just go, I hate that I do this, I suck,
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.340]   you just shut down.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.580]   So that's the key is always being productive
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.420]   with the criticism.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.740]   - Yeah, and the basics of life,
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.780]   I'm just like grateful for it, to be alive.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.660]   That's nice to be a couple of that with--
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.860]   - Two legs. - Self-criticism.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.020]   - Again, the hairline, the hog, the muscles, the world.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.260]   You got a good brain on you.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.780]   I mean, you're lucky.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.580]   You're in the top, you know, most people are fat as shit
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.020]   at Burger King right now hitting their kids.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:46.020]   You're in a Ramada hotel sitting with, you know,
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.660]   low-level comedian.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.620]   - For the record, I ate McDonald's last night.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.180]   - Oh, all right, well, you're human.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.580]   - Well, just so you know, this is not me defending,
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.620]   I'm not sponsored by McDonald's, but I mostly eat meat
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.340]   and there's nothing wrong with the beef they have.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.020]   It's actually one of the easiest ways late at night--
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.020]   - I think it's horse, I don't know if it's actually cow.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.140]   - It's actually rats, yeah, you're right.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.500]   - But hey, it's just meat.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.940]   I'm a meat guy myself.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.460]   They say in 20 years we're gonna look back and go,
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.540]   can you believe people ate meat?
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.540]   It's gonna look like somebody like slavery.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.100]   - Yeah, there's some ethical, difficult things
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.660]   with factory farming.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.180]   - Yeah, so let's ride it out now while we still got it.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.580]   - And now it's on record.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.420]   Tom Waits said something about New York.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.300]   You like Tom Waits?
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.460]   - I think he's underrated.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.900]   I think he's got great, he's got a great,
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.020]   he's great at quips and quotes.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.300]   Check him out on YouTube.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.460]   He's got some montages and super cuts of him being hilarious.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.760]   - What does he say about,
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.060]   "I'd rather have a bottle in front of me
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.460]   "than a frontal lobotomy."
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.420]   - That was the one, that was the one that sold me.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.580]   I was like, this guy's awesome.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.900]   - Yeah, but his music, 'cause he's just a genius musician.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.740]   - Yeah.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.780]   - Anyway, he was talking about New York.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.980]   I was walking around these, I'm in New York right now,
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.420]   we're in New York right now.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.900]   It's still a magical city to me.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.900]   A lot of people are quite cynical about it,
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.260]   about the state of things, but--
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.100]   - Rogan.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.220]   (laughing)
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.260]   - Not like Michael Malice, like a lot of friends of mine,
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.620]   they're just, a lot of folks,
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.900]   I mean, San Francisco, New York,
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.220]   there's something about the pandemic
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.580]   where people have become quite cynical
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.140]   about the place they are and they try to escape.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.980]   It's interesting.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.620]   I mean, they're asking some difficult questions
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.060]   about what they are in life.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.140]   They're having like a self-imposed midlife crisis.
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.820]   It's good, I think, for everybody
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.300]   to go through this process,
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.580]   but I think, I hope New York reemerges--
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.420]   - It will.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.940]   - As the flourishing place for the weirdos.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.780]   Anyway, Tom Waits said, "New York, of course,
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.380]   "is to be in endless surreal situations
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.420]   "where a $50,000 gunmetal Mercedes
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.420]   "pulls up in a puddle of blood
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.580]   "and outsteps a 25-carat blonde with a $2 wristwatch."
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.420]   - Woo!
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.820]   - And he keeps going on.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.660]   So like it's like--
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.700]   - That's like bars.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.540]   He's like a rapper.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's good.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.260]   But basically, just the absurdity of it all.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.620]   Lots of money, lots of weirdos,
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.140]   degenerates and dreamers and the whole mix of it.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.980]   Do you think that's an accurate description
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.620]   of what New York is today?
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.220]   Like is there still place for the weirdos
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.940]   and just the interesting artists,
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.380]   the edgy, the comedians, the creators,
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:35.220]   the entrepreneurs, as opposed to like Wall Street,
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.540]   as opposed to like rich folk,
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.900]   and then like hopeless folk?
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.700]   - Yeah, I think it's definitely changed a lot.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.180]   There's a tiny corner for us weirdo artists.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.300]   New York used to be where you went to make it
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.100]   as a painter or whatever, a comedian or a singer,
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.220]   and there were all these dives and shitboxes
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.700]   and all these places you could go,
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.060]   and now it's more Pink Berries
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.540]   and Subway sandwiches and Chase Banks.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.940]   So it's definitely lost a lot of its creative edge.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.780]   It's just money.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.600]   Money keeps coming in,
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.780]   and now you see all these comedians move to Nashville,
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.740]   Austin, Denver, whatever.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.700]   So it doesn't have the power it used to have
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.040]   of like you gotta be here if you wanna make it.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.980]   That's definitely gone.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.140]   So that hurt the city a lot.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.940]   The city is way more soulless.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.660]   When I moved here in '07,
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.220]   I mean, not only did I get mugged three times
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.540]   in the first year,
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.180]   but it was a hub of like,
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.780]   it felt like things were happening here.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.940]   You know, it was an energy, it was electricity,
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.960]   and we still have the electricity,
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.180]   but it's also maybe just 'cause there's Times Square,
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.180]   there's Soho, there's Wall Street.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.500]   So we got the staples,
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.180]   but there is a little bit of that,
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.340]   it's almost like a marriage.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.480]   Like, yeah, we're in love,
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.540]   but it's not as passionate as it once was.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.740]   That's how I would equate New York.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.660]   - What gives you hope?
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.700]   You're pretty hopeful about it, though.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.140]   - I'm hopeful just 'cause I know it's magical,
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.540]   and I think it has to be.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.100]   I mean, it's the epicenter of America.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.020]   Like, this is where the immigrants came,
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.420]   and this is where the stock market is,
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.260]   and the entertainment industry, a lot of it is here.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.100]   So I think it's gonna happen,
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.620]   but something like the bottom has to fall out,
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.640]   and then people have to move back here and all that.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.580]   So something, the corporations are kind of fucking us.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.820]   They're just buying everything.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.020]   - Well, that's true for everything.
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.860]   - That's true for everything.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.980]   - It's true for Austin probably as well.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.140]   People are just buying out land and all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.860]   - You always hear of Hemingway and Dali,
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.360]   and all these guys went to Paris in the '20s,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.860]   or whatever that was.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.100]   Yeah, I get it now.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.740]   I used to be like, "Why do these guys go to Paris?
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.220]   "Why do these artists?"
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.180]   And now I get it 'cause it's freer there.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.600]   That's why Austin became like that Paris,
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.940]   where everybody's like, "I gotta get out of LA.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.980]   "I'm going there."
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.620]   But we came back from that.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.540]   The '70s were wild, and '90s were cool.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.740]   So maybe it'll come back.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.860]   Might just take a decade.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.700]   - Well, that's how stories are told.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.700]   There's always pockets of Paris within New York.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.820]   - True, true.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.020]   - There's just an opportunity to let your weird flourish
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.700]   is there in New York, I'm sure.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.580]   - It's there.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.400]   You gotta find it.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.100]   Before it was front and center.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.220]   - What's your favorite thing about New York?
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.060]   Like what kind of things just like--
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.260]   - I mean, how long is this pod?
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.720]   I could go on.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.500]   It's too much to put into one hour.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.460]   We've got other questions.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.360]   But I love that one neighborhood
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.260]   is wildly different than the next.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.440]   I'm in Little Italy, and then you take four steps,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.540]   now I'm in Chinatown.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.140]   I mean, and then the history there,
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.380]   and then the stories, and the food,
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.460]   and the culture, and all that.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.180]   And then you go 10 feet over here,
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.140]   and now you're in Brooklyn, and this is insane.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.100]   It's a whole other world.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.460]   And it's almost like a little America in one city.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.100]   And it's great.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.740]   And just the fact that they pulled it off.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.420]   Like Fifth Avenue goes way up,
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.680]   and you're like, "There's a billionaire's house
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.860]   "next to a hobo, and then this is a black guy
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.500]   "who's fighting with a Cuban guy,
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.260]   "and an Asian guy's trying to get in the middle of them,
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.280]   "and the cabbie's from the Middle East,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.920]   "and there's so many beautiful women here,
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.620]   "and there's so many brilliant minds here."
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.020]   And the pace is great.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.140]   It keeps people moving.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.740]   I mean, it just, you can't beat it.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.580]   And the city will fuck you in the ass, too.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.420]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.520]   You land at JFK, and you're like,
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.820]   "Oh, God, I got mugged.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.380]   "My Uber driver called me a homo.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.300]   "I stepped in human shit.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.700]   "Where the fuck am I?"
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.340]   So yeah, it's bad news, but that bad news,
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.940]   it's almost like the bullying.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.420]   It kills you in a weird way, but it makes you stronger,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.580]   and you build more layers, and layers, and layers.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.140]   That's why some new guy, some hayseed from Milwaukee
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.260]   shows up, you've been here 10 years,
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.340]   and you go, "Let me help you out,
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.180]   "'cause you got addressed.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.760]   "You're gonna get your ass kicked for like six months,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.060]   "but I know the ropes a little,
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.880]   "and I think you need a little of that.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.980]   "If the treadmill's not on, you're not gonna run.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.340]   "New York, the treadmill's on."
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.980]   So it just makes you run, and it makes you better.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.820]   And look, it wears on you.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.260]   You probably lose 10 years of your life
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.740]   living in New York versus Indianapolis,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.580]   but it's a better life.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.940]   Have you seen "25th Hour" with Ed Norton?
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.420]   Yeah, it's been a while.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.460]   Spike Lee joint?
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.740]   Yeah, Spike Lee joint.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.340]   I mean, Ed Norton, there's a whole monologue there
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.140]   about New York. Oh, that's right.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:29.900]   But they're talking about just, he has a mix.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.940]   There's melancholy music, I think,
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.100]   or just a melancholy feel to the whole thing,
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.940]   but there's an anger and a disgust with the city.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.060]   Yeah. But through the anger
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.900]   and the disgust comes out a love for the city.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.020]   Same with, was "Taxi Driver" in New York?
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.260]   Oh, yeah, it's Gordon Raisey.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.620]   Yeah, so there's something about, what is that?
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.620]   What is that grit of the city that pushes you down?
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.260]   Well, that's the beauty of the city
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.780]   is it's this tribal human nature,
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.180]   like the sex shops and fistfights and racism
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.500]   and all this tension,
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.660]   but yet it's the epicenter of technology and finance
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.540]   and sophistication on Fifth Avenue.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.820]   So you get that juxtaposish.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.700]   It's kind of like in Boston.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.900]   You go to Boston, they got MIT, they got Harvard,
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.300]   they got all this shit.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.820]   And then they got the fishermen, the blue collar douchebags,
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.860]   the Irish guys, the immigrants,
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.780]   and you get that mix of insanely smart
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.180]   with wicked piss and these two worlds.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.420]   And that's a good thing.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.780]   It's like when a black guy fucks an Asian lady,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.420]   that's a good looking kid.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.860]   You get a mix.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.460]   We're mixing two totally different things
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.780]   that are coming together and it makes it,
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.140]   it's like peanut butter and chocolate.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.540]   Peanut butter and chocolate, I've never tried that.
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.780]   What?
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.620]   Maybe I have.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.460]   What are you talking about?
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.280]   I'm talking about Reese's, man.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.120]   Like Reese's, yeah.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.180]   Oh, it's the best candy.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.020]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.660]   Without the fakeness of LA,
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.460]   without the kind of, with the facade.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.780]   Yeah, LA's tough.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.740]   What's the difference between LA comedy
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.140]   and New York comedy to you?
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.580]   I think one place you kind of go to make it
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.460]   and be discovered and be loved,
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.180]   and one place you go, you can get all that in New York too,
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.060]   but I think in New York it's more of a school,
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.060]   a boot camp of comedy.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.740]   Let's make great comedy.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.980]   Let's make original comedy.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.300]   Let's watch the other guys and gals
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.860]   who are at the show, at the clubs,
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.740]   and learn from them and try to hang out with them
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.220]   and absorb some of them.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.100]   And in LA, it's like, when am I on?
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.120]   I'm next, get out of my way.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.940]   I'm the star here.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.340]   I'm a bigger star than you.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.660]   Oh, this guy's actually a big star.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.700]   I gotta outwork, you know, it's a lot of that
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.500]   instead of like, damn, that was funny.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.900]   I gotta be that funny.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.020]   Damn, I wish I had a joke.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.020]   And look, I don't wanna speak for LA Comics
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.940]   'cause there's Bill Burr, Anthony Jelzilek,
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.300]   these brilliant LA Comics,
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.540]   but they all cut their teeth in New York, just saying.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.220]   Then they moved to LA.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.060]   That's a good point.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.380]   You know, Ali Wong, all these people, killer comics,
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.260]   but New York, started in New York, moved to New York.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.340]   There is something about comics that stay in New York
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.100]   for a long time, though, like Dave Vitello.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.620]   Ah, you know about Dave?
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.380]   Yeah, yeah, he wants to do this podcast.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.220]   He does?
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.300]   Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Dave Vitello.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.140]   Wow, yeah, he's a king.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.940]   But it's like, it's almost like he doesn't want to make it.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.780]   I don't know.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.860]   I mean, you probably know him,
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.300]   but it feels like you just,
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.900]   maybe it's romanticizing it,
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.020]   but you're like, you almost just love the art of comedy,
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.060]   of becoming funnier, crafting the jokes,
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.700]   becoming funnier than the other comics,
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.580]   like competing with each other kind of thing,
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.900]   not over money or fame or any of that,
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.180]   just purely the comedy of it.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.260]   Totally, that's Dave.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.100]   That's him in a nutshell.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.780]   He's like that guy in the movies in the '80s,
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.100]   action movies where they're like,
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.620]   they go up to a creek in Montana,
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.820]   and some guy's living in a cabin,
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.100]   and he's sharpening a stick,
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.100]   and they go, "The Russians are coming, they're invading.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.860]   "We need you, you're the best commando."
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.500]   And he's like, "I gave that up, man.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.820]   "I'm done with that lifestyle."
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.620]   They're like, "But you're the best, we need you."
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.780]   And he has to suit up eventually.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.180]   He looks at a picture of his dead wife,
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.460]   and he goes, "Fuck it, I'm going."
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.460]   And then they fight the Rooskies.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.220]   But he's that guy.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.740]   He just is gifted.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.820]   He's got a gift from Allah, and he's the best.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.660]   Yeah, a lot of comics give him props.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.140]   It's always surprising to me.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.660]   'Cause it's surprising to me
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.660]   because he hasn't really made it big.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.500]   He did.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.380]   In the '90s, he was huge.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.580]   He had his own TV show.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.420]   He was the boy.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.940]   Yeah, yeah, that show was awesome.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.260]   But I mean, as big as I think he deserves to be.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.100]   Well, that's art.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.900]   The mainstream shit is always the worst.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.500]   It's like McDonald's versus some hole in the wall.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.900]   I know I'm shitting on McDonald's again, but it's good.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.140]   And certain comics we could name are good,
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.140]   but the delicacy is gonna be less talked about
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:56.940]   and less household namey than the mainstream hacky shit.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.700]   Yeah, it's funny 'cause he hasn't,
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.060]   I think he was on Joe Rogan's show once, maybe.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.140]   Yeah, once or twice.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.700]   And he was with somebody else.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.540]   Jeff Ross?
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.340]   Yeah, he met him with Jeff Ross.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.500]   Oh yeah, 'cause they did that two mics thing, whatever.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.340]   Oh, with mics, yeah.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.660]   But he's the quickest guy.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.780]   There's no one funnier.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.260]   Yeah, yeah, him and you, you're super quick.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.660]   Your recent appearance on Rogan was hilarious.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.500]   Oh, thanks.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.020]   Just so fast.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.500]   You're on with Ari and-
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.340]   Shane Gillis.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.180]   Shane Gillis.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.020]   Yeah, that was fun.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.500]   We're going back in January.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.340]   Yeah, nice.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.740]   This is never come out.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.860]   Neither will you.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.340]   We're having fun.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.180]   Yep.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.340]   All right, so what does it feel like,
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:49.020]   to bomb in standup comedy, like to fail?
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.900]   Maybe the psychology of it first,
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.220]   like just take me through it.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.100]   'Cause we're talking about being outnumbered in a fight,
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.060]   just being beat up.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:58.900]   Very similar.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.620]   By the way, this is like a no eye contact off.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.460]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.300]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.140]   I like catching clips.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:05.980]   We're both uncomfortable with it.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.620]   Yeah, it's great, it's kind of nice to be with my people.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.420]   But yeah, it's fun.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.300]   Do you need to shoot a paper to look at or?
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.300]   Yeah, I'm going, I got a good sweet spot right there.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.140]   Nice.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.860]   Yeah, it's a nightmare, but it's part of it.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.300]   It's the validation too is the worst part.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.220]   'Cause whenever you do comedy and kill,
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.220]   you can be a great comic,
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.980]   but even David Tell, these brilliant guys,
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.820]   they feel like they're getting,
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.220]   you feel like you're getting away with something.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.340]   I don't have a day job, I'm telling jokes for a living.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.580]   I'm talking about my dick up here
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.620]   and they're fucking loving me
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.500]   and they call me a genius and all this.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.700]   I'm talking about my sack.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.340]   And it's great, it makes people happy and it's funny,
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.780]   but that bombing, when you bomb,
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.820]   your first thought is like, yeah, you're right.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.820]   At first you're like, fuck you guys.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.780]   What, you don't like this shit?
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.020]   And then you just start going in.
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.940]   You're like, yeah, maybe it isn't that good.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.780]   Maybe they're right.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.700]   I do suck.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.860]   I knew I sucked.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.300]   I should become a mailman.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.580]   And it stinks and you feel alone.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.180]   And you feel like you wasted their time.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.460]   And then you're like, what was I thinking?
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.380]   I could be a comedian.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.900]   What the fuck, who am I?
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.740]   Eddie Murphy, what am I doing here?
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.340]   So it's a lot of just spiraling out of horrible thoughts.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.580]   But I also love that it hurts so bad.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.260]   Bombing fucking hurts because now everybody doesn't do it.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.220]   I think a lot more people could do comedy probably
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.460]   and figure it out.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.460]   But the bombing is so brutal that it keeps,
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.460]   one time I went to Minneapolis.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.580]   I was like, this is a great city.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.820]   I mean, the sun is shining.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.460]   Why isn't this city like packed?
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.900]   And they're like, 'cause the winters are so bad
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.700]   and we love it 'cause it keeps everybody out.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.820]   And I feel the same about comedy.
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.820]   The bombs are so brutal.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.340]   I've had bombs where I'm in bed.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.700]   I'm just staring at the ceiling like,
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.780]   what the fuck was that?
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.420]   Like you have PTSD.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.940]   I bombed at an arena once, 20,000 people.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.700]   I did 30 minutes to silence.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.820]   - So it's not just like one joke fails.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.620]   It's like they start piling on like it's irrecoverable.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.980]   - Yes, and one joke failing is very common.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.860]   Like a lot of audience don't even notice that bomb.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.540]   'Cause you got so many jokes in a row.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.140]   You can sandwich a good one, then a bad one,
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.140]   then a good one.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.460]   But when you bomb, it's almost like they chose,
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.140]   we don't like you.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.500]   Nothing you say will redeem yourself.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.780]   And it's hard to get out of.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.300]   It's like being pulled down by your hair.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.420]   You can't get back.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.940]   I can't win this fight no matter what.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.620]   - Can you like get him back by acknowledging
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.940]   like the elephant in the room?
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.100]   - That helps.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.540]   That helps, but they're still gonna go,
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.340]   that was funny when he made fun of it, but he sucks.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.180]   - He still sucks.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.380]   - He still sucks.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.340]   That's the worst part.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.100]   You're going, no, this is good.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.220]   You guys just don't like me.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.540]   Just 'cause you don't like me doesn't mean I'm bad.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.740]   - Yeah, I like going to open mics a lot.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.540]   Just listening, because first of all,
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.180]   I think the audience in the open mic,
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.460]   at least the ones I've been to,
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.900]   is most, I guess, other comedians.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.540]   Or like at least people who don't seem
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.300]   to wanna laugh at anything.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.660]   And so I just love it 'cause it's human nature
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.540]   and perseverance at its best.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.660]   But here's comedians, like clearly,
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.140]   this is mostly in Austin, they have a dream.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.820]   Like, why would you get up there?
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.660]   - Right.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.900]   Maybe some weird New Year's resolution bullshit,
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.300]   but for the most part, it's people who wanna be comedians.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.580]   - Like a lot of the open micers are people
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.180]   who clearly have done this for quite a long time already.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.500]   Like at least a year or two, maybe five years.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.060]   And they're often not very funny.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:34.140]   And just bombing in front of an audience
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.460]   of like 20, where they're just sitting there,
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:42.460]   almost like mocking them with their eyes.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.980]   Or maybe, and I don't know, and they still push through.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.380]   They still, as if they're doing an arena
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.020]   and everybody's laughing.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   - Yes.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.260]   - They still got that energy trying,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.180]   almost like to an audience that doesn't exist.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.000]   Like an audience of their dreams.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.900]   'Cause I guess you have to do that
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.740]   to keep the energy of the act going.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.040]   And it's just so beautiful to watch them try it.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.700]   And also what happens, open mic, I don't know,
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.860]   five minutes, whatever they do,
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.860]   they walk off and walk back off stage.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.860]   And like, you can't, who do they look at?
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.060]   Like, what do you look,
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.860]   do you make eye contact with people?
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.700]   Do you?
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.340]   - You look at your phone, you look at your feet,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.660]   you just zone out.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.380]   You kinda, woo, you kinda go white.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.460]   You just hear a white noise and go out.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.500]   It's tough.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.420]   But you gotta, you need a little delusion
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.400]   to be a comedian.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.340]   To get into it, it takes a little bit of delusion.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.100]   Like, you think you can do this?
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.980]   You know, you got 10 years ahead of you of hell
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.660]   and you're up for this?
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.980]   And you know, most comics, we see a horrible crowd
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.300]   and we see our friend bomb and we go,
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.060]   yeah, he's bombing, but I'll get him.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.460]   I'll get him.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.940]   And then you don't get him.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.540]   But that's human nature too, is like,
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.420]   I, they don't like him, but they'll like me.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.180]   And you need a little of that to keep going as a comedian.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.340]   But you don't want too much delusion
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.620]   'cause then you're a psycho.
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.980]   But you need a little.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.980]   - Well, a psycho could be good for a comedy.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.740]   - That's true too, a lot of psychos.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.740]   - I mentioned to you offline that I talked to Elon
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.500]   and we talked about doing standup.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.900]   He's thinking maybe do a few minutes of standup.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.660]   - I was gonna say, if you need a coach, Elon, I gotcha.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.620]   - Well, maybe you should move to Austin
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.060]   to coach him full-time.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.100]   - Ah, hopefully he can fly me in.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:36.180]   - So what advice would you give to somebody
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.180]   who wants to try to do five minutes?
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.180]   Like the early steps of trying to go to an open mic
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.460]   and say something funny?
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.420]   - Well, that's the irony of comedy is,
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.180]   I don't know if it's irony, but it's like,
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.700]   the beginning is the hardest part.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.340]   Usually the beginning is the easy part.
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.260]   Hey, I'm playing this level of Mario.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.780]   I start, I jump over one Koopa Troopa, whatever.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.580]   And then the end is like, Jesus Christ,
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.140]   I got 30 guys coming at me.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.100]   Comedy is the opposite.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.940]   The beginning is like, it's a gauntlet.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.140]   It's just obstacles.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.900]   And it's like you said, open mics.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.700]   I watch these famous comedians on Netflix and you go,
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.060]   this would all bomb on an open mic.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.180]   They're killing in Radio City.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.300]   This would bomb on an open mic.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.260]   That's the weird part.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.980]   So it's almost like you have to go through hell
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.300]   just to get to the promised land.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.260]   And I would say, rehearse the shit out of it
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.820]   because you're gonna get frazzled up there.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.540]   Everybody thinks, oh, this is good material.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.260]   But you also forget about the other part of delivering it,
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.820]   having confidence, being likable, having timing,
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.100]   having a cadence, figuring out who you are,
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.300]   figuring out what the audience thinks you are
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.820]   or how they perceive you.
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.160]   'Cause you can go up there and say all this,
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.380]   but they go, well, that's the guy, he's clearly gay.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.860]   Why is he acting like he's not gay?
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.820]   You know, that's all, now they're not listening to the joke.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.380]   So like, you gotta know how you look.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.180]   And it's just repetition, repetition.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.980]   And bombing is not failure.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.140]   That's what you gotta remember.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.620]   I mean, look, if you do a killer hour
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.180]   and then you take it to Netflix and bomb, you fucked up.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.840]   But bombing is not failure, it's just data.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.700]   It's going, oh, okay, I gotta retool that.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.820]   That didn't work, something's wrong there.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.180]   I missed a word there.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.620]   So you gotta treat the act almost like ingredients
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.540]   in a cooking, in a dish, you know, like,
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.900]   oh, I put too many eggs in, take an egg out.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.340]   You gotta treat it like that.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.540]   And look, when you pull a bad cake out of an oven,
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.860]   you go, I fucked up.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.540]   But it doesn't hurt your feelings.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.420]   But when you bomb and fuck up, it hurts your feelings.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.640]   So you gotta factor that in too.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.060]   Your feelings are gonna be hurt.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.900]   And just almost be a robot
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.260]   and just keep going towards that open mic.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.860]   You know how scary an open mic is?
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.540]   Bombing sucks, but bombing in front of other comedians
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.140]   is way worse, 'cause they know what just happened.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.460]   And they could have saved you, and they didn't.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.220]   So it's way worse.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.980]   - And they're gonna be your quote-unquote friends
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.180]   for this journey.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.060]   - Yeah, no, these are evil people, mostly.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.860]   Twisted, fucked up people.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.260]   - Can you tell, like, in those early days,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.100]   let's just talk about that, like, the open mic level,
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.220]   that a joke is gonna be good on paper?
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.700]   Like, I'll give you my experience,
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.580]   'cause maybe you could be my coach
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.180]   in this particular moment. - Please.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.020]   - So-- - You're like Larry Nassar.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.540]   (laughing)
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.380]   That's fun, huh?
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.980]   Joking, everybody, I hope nobody takes it seriously.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.980]   - I now have an amazing team of folks
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.980]   who help me with editing,
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.460]   and they're now currently sweating
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.860]   as they watch this. - Ah, you gotta leave
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.940]   that one in, that was quick.
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.700]   - Yeah, that was pretty good. - I'll eat that one.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.540]   - That was good.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.300]   (laughing)
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.140]   All right, so going in front of an audience,
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.440]   just even to give a lecture terrifies me,
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:53.300]   which I've done, but open mic, I mean, that to me,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.620]   perhaps that's why I like going to open mics and listening,
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.980]   is 'cause I just, it terrifies me so much,
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.660]   that idea of going up there and bombing.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.140]   I mean, it's scary, and to do even, like, one minute,
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.580]   to be honest, is scary, and five minutes.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.220]   I'm also, watched enough open mics
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.100]   to realize that five minutes is a long time.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.340]   I mean, it depends on your comedy,
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.860]   but if you're doing fast stuff,
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.540]   five minutes is a really long time.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.460]   - Oh, it's eternity.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.340]   - I guess with a long story, two is a long time,
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.860]   because if the story's not,
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.060]   you're building up to something,
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.020]   if the story's gonna fail,
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.460]   you just spent all that time telling the story
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.500]   that completely went flat.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.620]   - Completely. - You got nothing.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.180]   I guess if you have a series of jokes,
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.740]   you can at least try to recover,
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.380]   and do the Mitch Hedberg thing,
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.060]   where like, all right, I'll cross that off.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.820]   - Well, I'm able to, like, I've tried to write a few things,
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.740]   and I'm able to tell that it's really bad.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.420]   - Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, well, that's better than most.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.860]   Most people's egos kick in, and go, no, this is good.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.220]   - No, see, I'm able to introspect that.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.660]   Like, it seems funny.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.500]   I mean, I guess the thing I'm looking for is original.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.380]   Like, there's easy stuff that you think is funny,
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.900]   but to me, originality is the thing
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.980]   you should be looking for.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.380]   - I agree. - Because then,
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.220]   that's what actually becomes funny.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:22.220]   Like, or rather, if it's original, even if it bombs,
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:27.860]   that feels like more a beautiful art creation that you did.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.740]   Like, at least you swung for it.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.980]   Like, you did something unique.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.900]   'Cause like, even with open mic, your first five minutes,
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.420]   there's so many, just go to enough open mics,
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.460]   you'll hear like all the, there's like a list of jokes
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.620]   that you can just go to.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.280]   First of all, you can make fun of the fact
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.060]   that you're at an open mic,
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.900]   that you're like doing this for the first time, and so on.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.140]   You could do a lot of stuff where you make fun
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.620]   of your appearance in some way, and so on.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.700]   But like, yeah, you could do that, you know,
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.580]   that takes actually, that's way harder than people realize
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.460]   to do it in an original way.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.260]   - Yes. - To present who you are
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:07.260]   as a person very quickly, enough to then put that person
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.620]   down in front of everybody else.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.540]   So you have to reveal the--
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.700]   - The audience is like that, 'cause they go,
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.860]   he knows what we're thinking.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.340]   But do it again in an original way.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.620]   And so like, when I'm trying to write stuff,
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.820]   not that I've tried long, it's like 30 minutes.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.460]   But as enough to see like, oh shit,
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.980]   to write something original is really difficult.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.340]   - It is, but do you got a bit, anything?
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.180]   - No, I don't want to do--
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.620]   - You didn't write any one line or anything?
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.540]   - For this, no.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.380]   - Well, just in general, ever in your life,
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.220]   ever written a joke?
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.340]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.180]   - Oh, okay.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.300]   - No, but I don't have anything in my mind popped up.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   So the jokes that I've written have more,
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.900]   like for some reason, my mind goes to like dark places.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.660]   So, you know, like, and not actually dark
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:00.020]   in the Mark Norman dark, because you go really dark
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.180]   to where it's like almost absurd.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.940]   My natural inclination is to go to like
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.940]   a dark historical place, like Hitler and Stalin.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.900]   And almost, so go to that place
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.900]   and then talk about something absurd there.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.320]   So like, don't go like all the way, I don't know,
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.920]   I don't want to give examples because it'll be clipped.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.360]   But the Mark Norman style, look it up,
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.960]   he has a special on his YouTube.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.360]   That kind, I want to almost explore the dark aspects
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.740]   of human nature more kind of connected
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.260]   to actual historical figures.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.240]   That's the inclination.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.940]   Like, I don't know, Nature's Metal,
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.480]   the Instagram channel that explores
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.400]   like the darkness of nature, like something there.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.140]   - See, that's good that you already know
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.160]   that you've kind of gotten to the core
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.400]   of your comedy already.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.960]   And that's interesting.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.480]   That's a step ahead.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.860]   - Yeah, I can hear, with most things that I do in life,
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.160]   I can like hear the music from a distance,
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.040]   like in myself, like, okay, if you have anything,
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.920]   this is the direction it'll be
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.240]   without actually knowing exactly all the steps.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.840]   And that's a nice motivation to be like,
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.840]   all right, well, if you do this for a long time,
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.680]   maybe you'll have a chance to get there.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.520]   - Right.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.220]   - But you have to, that's where it's a feature
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.200]   to be super self-critical, I think.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.020]   - Yes.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.240]   - But then that's why it's fucking terrifying
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.160]   to walk up to a stage, stand there,
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.680]   and probably forget everything.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.480]   - Yeah, that's the other part nobody thinks about.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.900]   Just goes right out of your head.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.800]   You go fight or flight, it's ugly.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.400]   My first years were horrific bombing,
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.480]   horrific stammering, horrific not remembering the punchline.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.040]   Like, maybe you got a little setup going
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.280]   and they're kind of on board and you're like,
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.000]   ah, how's that, camera, out goes.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.720]   And you just hate yourself.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.500]   It's a nightmare.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.020]   But you've already kind of,
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.600]   maybe if you haven't done standup or whatever,
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.920]   but you kind of know your voice.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.760]   And that's pretty advanced.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.320]   - So you're not trying to be somebody else.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.600]   I guess, yeah, just for having done like podcasts
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.160]   and lecture and so on.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.000]   - That helps.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.620]   - I've already done some of the work of the standups do,
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.880]   which is embarrass yourself in front of others
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.440]   for prolonged periods of time.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.280]   - Yes.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.520]   - Yeah, so I'd done that
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.440]   without actually developing the funny.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.560]   - Right, right, right.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.840]   - But maybe the funny just is not that difficult to develop.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.160]   No, it's super difficult, of course,
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.000]   but I mean, maybe the essential work of a standup comedian
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.080]   is just the embarrassment of like finding who you are.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.720]   - Yeah, that's a part of it for sure.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.840]   You know, in the beginning you're like, water bottle.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.120]   What's funny about water bottle?
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.520]   Hmm, I'm a funny guy, I can make this funny,
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.380]   but that's not it, you know?
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.060]   It's your shit, your shit, like your dark stuff.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.140]   For me, I tend to gravitate towards dark,
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.260]   but in a weird way where, you know,
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.620]   people will say like, hey, don't objectify women.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.500]   But then they go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.860]   And you're like, well, wait, I know something's off here.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.540]   Why can you objectify her, but not the supermodel?
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.720]   So what's going on there?
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.500]   And I like to play with that.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.640]   So I have this joke where I say Caitlyn Jenner,
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.200]   oh, women go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful, beautiful woman.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.240]   I go, well, you look like her.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.880]   And they go, fuck you.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.160]   And you're like, there's a lot of truth there.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.020]   But I like exploring that kind of,
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.600]   oh, you're trying to get one over on me,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.160]   or you're lying to yourself, or what are we doing here?
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.980]   And I like that kind of comedy.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.080]   I don't see color.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:31.900]   Well, I'm black.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.280]   No, you're not, ah.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.040]   You know, that's fun 'cause you're lying.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.380]   Yeah, okay, so like big time comedians,
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.540]   such as yourself, don't like to think of yourself
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.380]   in this way.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.200]   - I don't know.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.040]   Here we go.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.700]   - Yeah, this is like where you over philosophize comedy.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.700]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.300]   - It seems like comedians--
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.140]   - Don't say important.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.060]   Nothing worse than a comedian who thinks they're important.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:58.900]   - Yeah.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.180]   So I was going there, I was trying to find,
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.980]   as I was trying to say these words,
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.420]   I realized how cliche it is and how uninteresting it is.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.640]   So I'm going to just, but there is something--
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.960]   - I'm worried this whole thing is uninteresting.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.240]   I'm like, who cares about comedy?
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.880]   There's like six comics on the planet.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.000]   - Yeah, nobody cares.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.220]   - Okay.
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.920]   I trust you in the pilot seat.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.760]   You know what you're doing.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.840]   You got listeners.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.280]   - They've tuned out long ago.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.680]   - Oh, we gotta get Dan Carlin on here, huh?
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.640]   Is he around?
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.520]   - Yeah, we're just going back and forth on Twitter just now.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.520]   He's a huge fan.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.760]   He was on here before, he'll be back.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.840]   I've been actually really trying
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.800]   to volunteer myself aggressively with Dan Carlin
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.760]   for like a Russian episode where I could speak Russian.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.160]   There's certain documents,
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.760]   I talked with Jaco about this too,
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.820]   certain things, I mean, I just love the challenge
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.800]   of bringing Russian documents that I can read in Russian
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.760]   and then can translate and can try to capture
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   the depth of the writing in the Russian language
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.600]   and communicate to an American audience.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.040]   So much is lost in translation.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.240]   Like there's so much pain and poetry in the Russian language.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.840]   It's just connected to the culture.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.040]   Every language, not every language,
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.400]   but many languages are uniquely able
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.560]   to capture the culture of the people.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.440]   I mean, in some way they're the representation
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.120]   of the culture of the people.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.760]   And so Russian is definitely that.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.920]   It like represents the full history and culture
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.840]   of the 20th century with all the atrocities,
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.120]   all the broken promises, all those kinds of things.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.280]   - Norm says Russian literature is,
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.360]   it's the most tapped into human existence
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.280]   than anything else.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.760]   - Norm. - McDonald.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.100]   - Yeah. - Big Russian literature guy.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.600]   Dostoevsky, all that shit.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.240]   - It's funny that there is a gap with comedians too.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   There's a culture of Russian comedy,
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.200]   like standup comedians that are told--
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.880]   - Is that right? - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.520]   - I don't know these Russians.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.320]   - I mean, I don't know today.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.840]   I mean more from the '80s and '90s.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.840]   And there was a-- - Yakov.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.960]   That's all I know.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.000]   - That's not, so there's like, of course, that's--
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.640]   - I've never seen you that offended.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.000]   - No, no, no, it's not offended.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.060]   There's a different,
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:18.520]   there's like the kinesins and the, there's the edgy--
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   - Is that Russian?
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.280]   - What do you mean?
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.160]   - Wait, I thought you said there was Russian comics.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.800]   - Yeah, Russian, I mean, I'm comparing--
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.640]   - Or style.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:29.080]   - I'm giving you like a style of darkness,
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.640]   like that's the kind of people
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.320]   that kind of challenge,
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:37.880]   they give, again, this is to how important comedians are,
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.280]   is they give a voice to people where in the Soviet Union
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.480]   you really can't like express your opposition
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.560]   to the government.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:52.160]   And so comedians are exceptionally important there
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.200]   for just, I don't know, channeling the anger,
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.280]   even when sometimes it's not the actual opposition
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.120]   to the government.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.600]   Just channeling the anger, the frustration
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.960]   with the absurdity of life.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.800]   Like, you know, when there's a shortage of food,
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:10.440]   shortage of jobs, the absurdity of the bureaucracy,
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.520]   like the top-heavy government,
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.840]   just all of that can only sometimes be expressed
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.520]   with like dark, absurd humor.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.880]   And that actually, why there's a culture
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.720]   of that kind of humor, you know,
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.520]   you gather around the table with vodka
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:31.920]   and all you can do is just talk shit and just-
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.080]   - Be offensive, say horrible shit, ball bust.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.880]   I mean, I make school shooting jokes
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.880]   and people go, "How do you do that?"
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   I'm like, "Well, maybe that's how I deal with it."
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.720]   - Yeah.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.560]   - You know, like how come I gotta empathize the way you do?
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.660]   Maybe we're different.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.840]   - All right, so now let's skip the whole open mic thing
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.760]   and crafting jokes.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.400]   - Oh, yeah, that's tough.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.360]   - Kerouac said, "One day I will find the right words
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.920]   "and they will be simple."
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:05.000]   When do you know the joke is done, it's perfect?
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.560]   You're somebody that does like really sharp,
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.200]   like fast jokes well.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.280]   - Oh, thanks.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.760]   - So like there's somebody, I don't know,
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.680]   I don't know who you see yourself in the same school as.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   Like, you're darker and faster than Hedberg, I think,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.800]   in terms of like, just, I don't know,
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.200]   the turns you take are very--
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.440]   - Thanks, I appreciate it.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.560]   I think I got some Norm MacDonald and maybe--
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.160]   - That's right, Norm, yeah.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.960]   - Obviously Norm, but Chris Rock was huge for me.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.440]   Chris Rock, old, like '90s Chris Rock was like,
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.840]   I didn't know you could do jokes like that.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.040]   I always loved George Carlin and Groucho Marx
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.160]   and Bill Murray.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.280]   There's so many different types of comedy,
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.440]   but when I saw the bigger and blacker "Bring the Pain,"
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.020]   I was like, "Oh my God, this is like, it hit me."
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:54.860]   So that was big.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.200]   And then Norm's just like the funniest guy on the planet.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.440]   So him being the smartest guy in the room
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.400]   but acting dumb was great.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   So yeah, Chris Rock has that way of cutting to the bullshit,
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.280]   which I mentioned earlier, I like that cutting
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.720]   through the bullshit kind of style of comedy.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.820]   Because you kind of go, "Oh, I'm not crazy."
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.080]   That's what I thought too.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.800]   I was too scared to say it, but I thought that.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.520]   And he's saying it in a room where people are laughing,
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.320]   maybe I'm not an idiot.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.920]   So that helped me.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:27.320]   - So it's observational, but not Jerry Seinfeld.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.520]   Observational, it's like going to the darker thing
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.480]   to like within society.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.040]   - But I like him too, but seeing it,
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.920]   doing it about stuff like in your life, society.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:42.720]   - Yeah, race, gender, government, politics,
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.560]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.440]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.480]   Sex, human emotions, jealousy, whatever it is.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.840]   That's the good stuff.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.320]   - How'd you feel when Norm passed away?
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:57.160]   - Ah, that was a bummer because he was, what, 61?
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.560]   And I just didn't see it coming.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.240]   And I just, I've watched so many hours of his stuff
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.440]   and I've met him and he was like this comedic bar.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.680]   Like, "Hey, we got Norm."
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.000]   There's so much shit comedy.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.400]   Then you see Norm and you're like, "This is next level.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.540]   "This is savant type shit."
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.000]   And then to lose him is like, ah.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.720]   Norm had 20 more years at least of just content
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.760]   and content and thoughts and his point of view.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.580]   And we'll never get that, and that sucks.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.380]   - Yeah, there is something about artists.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:32.040]   Like, Jimi Hendrix dying too early.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.080]   It's like, you wonder--
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.040]   - What was next?
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.240]   - Yeah, what was next?
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.080]   But then part of it is like,
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:43.320]   it all ends for all of us and it's like walking away early
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.920]   is kind of admirable.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.840]   It's almost like, I did a pretty good job.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.680]   - Yeah.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.800]   - I'm good with that.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.160]   And especially the way he did,
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.600]   which is not telling anybody.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.600]   - I know, nine years his best friends didn't even know.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.340]   And in this world of like victimhood and I need clicks
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.840]   and I need people to love me,
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.760]   he got canceled and yelled at and in trouble
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.080]   and he could have pulled that cancer card and he never did.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.800]   I mean, the integrity on this motherfucker.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.240]   - Did you get a chance to interact with him?
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.200]   Like, how often did you meet him?
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.640]   - I met him once at the comedy cellar
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.160]   and we chatted for five minutes and then he went on
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.920]   and did the Letterman set that he did.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.400]   He was running the Letterman set and sweet guy,
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.920]   nice guy, I didn't know him that well,
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.040]   but I mean, he's just brilliant.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.200]   And I also love a brilliant guy who does stupid stuff.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.480]   That's a fun little combo there.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:40.400]   Like silly guys who are actually brilliant also.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.480]   You know, like Louis CK is a brilliant comic
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.000]   and he'll do a joke about farting on a kid.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.240]   And you're like, that's great that he still finds farts
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.160]   funny and he's also this comedic genius guy.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.480]   I like that.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.440]   - And doesn't really acknowledge the genius.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.120]   - Like that's, yeah.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.760]   I like smart people, they're silly.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.880]   - Yes, that's a good combo.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.680]   Like you said, Elon is silly.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.120]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.160]   'Cause we teach kids like, hey, put that down, stop that,
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.400]   quit cutting up, quit horsing around.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.000]   But maybe that's some kind of sign of brilliance there.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.080]   - Yeah, being like childlike and silly
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:19.800]   is a kind of wisdom.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.320]   I feel like those people are way wiser than the people
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.680]   that, no offense to me, wear a suit
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.960]   and take themselves way too seriously.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.600]   - No, but you got a spark in you.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.440]   - A little bit.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.200]   - You got a little, what's the word?
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.600]   Not elf, imp.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.720]   Little imp in you.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:36.560]   Give that a go.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.400]   You know what imp?
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.600]   Little mischievous, it's like a little--
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.240]   - Is that a Tolkien character, imp?
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.080]   - Yeah, might be.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.960]   - An imp is a European mythological being
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.640]   similar to a fairy or a demon.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.600]   You calling me a fairy?
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.440]   - Well--
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.560]   - Frequently, okay, similar to a fairy or a demon.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.240]   I feel like that's a big leap.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.640]   - Big leap, yeah, that's not a great info bio there.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.320]   - Frequently described in folklore and superstition,
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.560]   the word may perhaps derive from the term imp,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.620]   spelled with a Y, used to denote a young grafted tree.
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:12.080]   - It's a little mischievous, you got a twinkle.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.000]   You're the serious buttoned up guy, but this is a twinkle.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.560]   - This is a twinkle, wow.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.960]   And the audience can see the twinkle,
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.760]   and that's why you resonate, I think.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.920]   - Deep analysis by Mark Norman, psychological analysis.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.920]   Okay, but then back to the crafting of the joke.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.740]   You said Chris Rock and Norm Macdonald, what for you,
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:35.440]   how do you know when the joke is done?
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.840]   Are there some jokes that you are proud of,
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.000]   wow, that's well done?
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.320]   - Yeah, the joke is done, it's a tough question
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.520]   'cause there's so many different kinds of jokes.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.360]   There's what we call a chunk, which is a big idea
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.140]   with a bunch of jokes in the middle of it,
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.200]   and then a big crescendo at the end,
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.400]   or there's a one-liner, or there's a tag of a joke
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.660]   that's also a joke.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:01.640]   So the jokes come in different,
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.600]   like I have a joke where I say,
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.520]   I met my girl on that Jewish app.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.680]   What's that Jewish app called?
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.040]   PayPal.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.880]   - Nice.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.120]   (laughing)
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.560]   - That's the hell, that's what the reaction you want
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.800]   from the crowd.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:17.120]   But it's a fun turn 'cause you say your thing
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.400]   and then I hit you with a misdirect,
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:19.440]   and that's what a joke is.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.840]   A joke is basically me saying something that makes sense,
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.520]   but you didn't see it coming.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.200]   And that's a perfect example of that.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.960]   So that joke took forever to figure out, by the way.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.720]   - You had to go to different services like PayPal,
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.600]   what's funniest?
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.800]   - Exactly, and I figured PayPal is funny
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.520]   'cause it has the word pay in it.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:42.080]   Venmo, it's also not really a good word, Venmo, PayPal.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.160]   It just hits better.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.800]   - Yeah, PayPal's funnier somehow.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.520]   - It's funnier somehow, and that's the beauty of comedy.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.920]   There's a weird little magic into it.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.120]   You can get technical all day and formulaic,
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.640]   but there's still that little bit of fairy dust
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.840]   that you don't know why this is funnier.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.720]   - Or imp dust.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.840]   - Imp dust, yes.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.880]   - The why, okay.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.600]   - So you know a joke is done when it kills,
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.640]   and there's a roundness to a joke
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.840]   when you feel like this is buttoned up, this is done here.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.960]   - Is simplicity the right word there?
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.800]   - Yeah.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.680]   - Is it like you're chopping stuff away
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:13.600]   or you're adding stuff?
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.560]   Like what does it feel like?
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.200]   - Simplicity is always the best angle.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.360]   I mean, you can get real high concept with a joke
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.080]   and still make it work, but the simpler the better.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.880]   I saw Dave Chappelle on stage once,
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.080]   and Chris Rock and Demetri Martin were in the back
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.480]   watching in awe, and Dave Chappelle,
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.360]   I can't remember the joke,
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.940]   but he said something about sex or women,
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.000]   and Demetri Martin goes, "Eh, it's a little easy,"
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.360]   and Chris Rock goes, "That's why it's good."
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.160]   And I remember hearing that as a young comic,
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.520]   like, "Ah, I'm getting this comedy lesson right here
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.720]   "for these two titans," and so that was fun.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.000]   Simple is key.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.160]   - So the easy is okay.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:55.080]   That's such a weird, I think I remember reading
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.200]   or hearing Eminem say something about maybe the song
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.720]   Slim Shady, one of the songs, he's like,
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:04.440]   "I knew it was gonna be good because it got
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.280]   "really repetitive and annoying very quickly,"
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.120]   or something like that.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.480]   - I mean, that's sort of the music equivalent
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.920]   of it's too easy.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.080]   Like, if it's super catchy, as a musician,
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.680]   you might get very quickly bored of it.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.320]   Or as you're creating it, no, it's too easy.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:26.840]   It's like, there needs to be some more complexity to it.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.960]   - I like complexity, but the best guys
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.600]   who are the ones who make complex shit look simple.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.920]   Like, you ever heard that Ben Franklin story
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.760]   where he's talking to his friend,
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.600]   he's like, "I'm gonna start a hat store."
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.520]   So he puts a sign out, it says, "Hats for sale, $12."
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.240]   And Ben Franklin looks at it, he goes,
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:49.000]   "Well, you don't need the $12 'cause all they need to know
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.080]   "is that you got hats for sale."
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.720]   He's like, "All right," so he loses the $12,
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.920]   makes a new sign, "Hats for sale," and he goes,
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.980]   "You don't really need for sale because it's a business.
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:58.600]   "People can put that together."
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.120]   So he just goes, "All right," he makes a new sign,
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.000]   it says, "Hats," and then Ben Franklin's like,
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.280]   "You know, you don't really need the word hat.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.080]   "You can just put a picture of a hat."
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.840]   And he made a new sign, which is a picture of a hat,
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.440]   and it helped the business or something.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.440]   That's like some old wives' tale or whatever,
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.920]   but I think about that all the time when I'm writing.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.280]   I thought this was going to, like, there was no sign.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.200]   It went super, like, realistic.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.200]   Oh, maybe, maybe, that could work, too.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.600]   What, like, as a comedian, so I'm a fan of yours.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.080]   I enjoy, I really enjoy you in conversations.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.640]   Wow, now?
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.840]   I'm getting nothing out of you.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.880]   No, this is--
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.800]   All right, I can't tell.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.000]   Oh, like emotion?
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.560]   You're tough not to read.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.720]   Cold inside.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.840]   I mean, just the quickness you have.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.240]   Obviously, you're also a great stand-up comedian.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.440]   What's your favorite medium to shine in?
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:50.120]   So you have a podcast yourself, an excellent podcast.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.080]   Thanks.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.520]   You're often the podcast guest.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.800]   Which is always fun to listen to,
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.680]   how you're gonna deal with the different people.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.280]   You're great on "Rogan."
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.120]   Oh, thanks.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.120]   What do you enjoy most?
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.920]   Podcasts are great because you can stretch out
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.640]   a little more, you can breathe a little.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.560]   You know, with a stand-up set,
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.840]   I like to be like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.920]   But podcasts are great 'cause it's conversational.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.800]   So you can be, it's almost like you're being funny
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.120]   with your friends.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.400]   Whereas a stage is like a, this is a piece,
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.760]   this is a presentation.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.240]   But I think the podcast is great,
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.000]   but you don't get the reaction.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.200]   Unless the host is laughing, you can't hear the guy
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.400]   in his car in New Jersey driving to work going, "Ah!"
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.520]   Every now and then, I'll read a comment like,
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.160]   "I spit out my coffee when you said this."
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.600]   And I'm like, but it's not immediate.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.440]   You want the immediate.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.520]   So stand-up will always be number one,
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.480]   but there's no better feeling than killing in a room
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.080]   of people who don't know who you are,
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.240]   strangers, you're in the middle of nowhere,
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.560]   you left your wife at home, you left your kids,
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.520]   you left your house, you're in the middle
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.560]   of bum-fucked Dickville and murdering
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.760]   for these hillbilly nobody, whatever it is.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.200]   And they're slinging their beers and woo,
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.280]   cheering you on and they carry you out.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.000]   And you fuck some fat lady and you leave
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.440]   and you get back to your hotel and you go,
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.320]   "Holy shit, what was that?
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.640]   "No one will ever know about it, just lost in the ether."
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.440]   That's the best feeling.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.580]   - Yeah, killing in obscurity, as Bill Burr would say.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.720]   - Yeah, this is one of the things that sucks
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   about giving lectures at universities,
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.800]   or giving lectures in general, is when you look
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.800]   at the audience, several hundred students,
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.120]   they all have a bored look on their face.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:36.960]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.040]   - Like my face now probably looks bored,
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.360]   but I'm actually excited to be talking to you.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   But there's something about just,
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.800]   there's something about a comedy called,
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.960]   maybe this is the contingent of laughter,
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.720]   but it gives people the freedom to just laugh,
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.720]   to remove that facade of you don't have to pretend
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.240]   like you don't care.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.720]   If you care, you can show it.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.560]   - Yes.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.600]   - And you can have fun with it.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.800]   Probably liquor helps a lot too.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.280]   - It helps, for sure.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.680]   But there is a, especially, and that's why comedy
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.400]   I think is so popular right now,
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.920]   because HR is up our ass, we're scared of old tweets
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.400]   that might come back to haunt us.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.240]   What did I say on that interview?
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.680]   Even people at offices are like,
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.040]   "I put something on Facebook in 1999
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.280]   "that was about fat tits that I liked.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.860]   "Should I get rid of that?"
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.820]   Even people say, "There's no cancel," whatever.
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.940]   There is something in the air right now
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.420]   that wasn't there before.
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:35.700]   It's the video, "I'm a Karen, I got caught at Trader Joe,"
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.860]   whatever it is, people rat on each other now,
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.040]   everybody's tattletailing 'cause they want the clicks.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.580]   It's a horrible society we've crafted.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:46.860]   But stand-up comedy gets you to come out,
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.220]   and now people do it at stand-up shows too, sadly,
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.380]   but it gets you to come out and let that inhibition down.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.740]   'Cause we're all human, we've all had the fucked up thoughts
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:57.020]   like, "Man, that guy's fat as shit."
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:57.980]   It doesn't mean you hate the guy,
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:58.820]   it doesn't mean you hate fat people,
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.260]   it doesn't mean you're fat-shaming,
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.580]   but you can't say that at the office.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.040]   You can't go, "Bob, you're fat as shit."
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.980]   You'll get fired for body-shaming.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.220]   But at the club, you go, "That guy's fat as shit."
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.940]   The crowd goes, "He is fat as shit, ah!"
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.180]   And it's this weird cathartic thing
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.180]   'cause all we do is tamp shit down.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.380]   It's kind of like you ever meet a girl
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.300]   who's all prim and proper in the bedroom,
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.700]   she's like, "Put a lamp up my ass, ah,"
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.740]   whatever it is.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.940]   It's 'cause we gotta get it out.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.980]   We're all repressed in some way.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.780]   - So I guess what you're saying is comedy's important.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.580]   (laughing)
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.900]   - Yes, callback!
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.300]   - All right. - Well played, sir.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.340]   - Yeah.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.020]   What do you think about Austin?
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.500]   What do you think about the comedy scene in Austin?
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.860]   We talked about LA and New York.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.380]   What do you think about what Joe's trying to create there?
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:46.700]   So I should say that the reason I moved to Austin,
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.420]   I have this dream of,
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.740]   it wouldn't be funny if I said this dream
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.820]   of becoming a comedian.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:51.660]   - Oh, God.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.980]   (laughing)
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980]   - It's an audience, at least.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.260]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.820]   You know, I always said you can hear the music
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.660]   in the distance.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.020]   I have this dream around robotics
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.100]   and artificial intelligence,
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:01.940]   whether it's a company,
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.020]   whether it's something else,
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.220]   that was just pulling me to,
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.700]   I actually wanted to move to San Francisco,
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.900]   and then all my friends in San Francisco said,
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:10.060]   "No, it's the wrong place."
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:10.900]   - Yeah.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:16.220]   - At this time, the cynicism there
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:20.380]   is just not conducive to taking big leaps
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:23.580]   into the unknown, excited about the future kind of thing.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.980]   And Austin was that,
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:28.140]   for me in particular with Elon Musk,
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.540]   but also just the energy that everybody had,
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.540]   including Joe, the excitement about the future.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.140]   I don't care if Austin burns to the ground
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.000]   and it actually is a complete failure.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.020]   Being excited about the future seems to be,
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:46.260]   like, optimism about the future seems to be the thing
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.380]   that actually makes that future happen,
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.600]   makes a great future happen.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   So it's always cool for me to see Joe super excited
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.900]   about creating a culture in Austin,
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.460]   like making it a comedy hub.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.740]   I don't wanna overstate it,
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.860]   but I think he really believes
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:08.340]   it'll be a very big place for comedy
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.500]   in the United States in general, in the world.
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.540]   And so just even believing that, that's powerful.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.380]   - I agree.
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:18.740]   - You start to make it happen, that energy is there.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.240]   Anyway, so, but that's for me
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.040]   from just an outsider watching the fun of it.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.080]   I should also mention for less of an outsider,
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.160]   more insider in the martial arts world,
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.120]   partially probably because of Joe, I'm not sure,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.240]   like John Donahue, Gordon Ryan, the B team,
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.760]   all of those folks, those are,
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.360]   that might be gibberish to you,
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.600]   but those are like some of the greatest grapplers
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.860]   and martial artists of all time.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:46.960]   So it's also becoming this hub of martial arts.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.880]   So the whole thing is just beautiful.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.920]   Anyway, what are your thoughts about that scene?
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.960]   - Well, there's a lot here, a lot of things to mention.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.960]   One, I think Joe did do that to a degree,
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.160]   all these people, Sagura lives there now,
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.720]   a lot of comics live there, he's opening clubs,
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.620]   other clubs are opening.
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.880]   I think it's happening.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.360]   That's the other thing is people go,
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.440]   everybody's moving to Austin, Austin's the new hub.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.840]   And then they look at their watch and they go,
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.360]   five minutes went by, nothing changed.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.920]   It's gonna take years, but everybody wants it now, now, now.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.880]   What, Austin, there's no industry there,
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.360]   there's no Netflix, whatever.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.320]   And you're like, yeah, I know, but it needs a minute.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.600]   You can't just do this overnight.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.060]   So people forget that.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.240]   So it could happen huge, just give it some time.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.080]   I mean, he's opening a club, I went and saw it.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:38.000]   It's incredible, like it's so perfect for comedy.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.960]   It's every detail, it's incredible.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.040]   But so it could happen still.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:47.240]   I do think there's a little biting off more
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.880]   than they can chew with Austin because it's not that big.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.200]   So like-- - And it's spread out.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.280]   I mean, yeah, it's not big.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.440]   And the infrastructure's not quite there to support it.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.720]   But it has a lot of, you know,
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.900]   comparing from the tech side,
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.000]   it has a lot of land to expand into.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.280]   So it might become this-- - True, that helps.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.840]   - Like you're basically establishing,
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.280]   it's kind of like New York,
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.800]   you're establishing these whole neighborhoods.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.240]   And you have the freedom to do that
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.400]   because there's a lot of space on all sides.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.720]   - Yes, okay, so that helps.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.660]   So again, maybe some time.
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.640]   I do agree with this, that new hope,
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.160]   that's kind of built into human beings of like,
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.560]   let's go to America, let's go to Utopia.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.680]   We even have it with space.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.280]   Let's go to Mars, we gotta see what's over there.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.300]   And it's just red, dusty bullshit, but you still gotta go.
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.400]   So I'm with you on that about this new hope, this new land.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.800]   And I think that is beautiful.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.000]   And I think there's a lot of haters,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   I think there's a lot of naysayers who hate change,
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.300]   who hate anything new.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:51.000]   And then I think you gotta go, hey, that hurts, that sucks,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.400]   but blow me, Dickless, I'm trying something, you're a loser.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.120]   Stop hating on me.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.320]   I mean, how many people hate Elon Musk, you know?
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.640]   - Yeah, it's hilarious.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   I mean, there's some of the criticism on Austin,
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.800]   it's like a fad.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.120]   Like a lot of people are really--
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:06.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.920]   - Are really, people are excited about Austin.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.800]   And somehow that's like, it's like when Green Day
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.320]   became famous, you no longer want to be a fan of Green Day.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.400]   But to me, like that's--
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.000]   - Austin was already a cool town.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.360]   Like every comic five years ago was like,
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.960]   ooh, I got Austin this weekend, I can't wait.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.360]   So it already had a buzz.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.440]   But some people think maybe the buzz was the cool part.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.120]   The fact that it was like this off the beaten path city,
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.600]   and now I get to visit it and then leave.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.320]   But I think it could still be this comedy tech booming place.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.240]   It just will take some time and people want it right now.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.000]   - Well, on the tech side, it's--
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.840]   - It's already there?
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.160]   - It's getting there very fast.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.760]   So I mean, Elon's really pushing that with the factory.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:58.520]   It's just a huge number of people are moving there with jobs
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.320]   like you're already starting.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.000]   And then the opportunities to launch new companies
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.080]   is just incredible.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.960]   I guess it's not right now, it's like within months,
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.160]   within a year, that kind of thing.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.480]   But like, it's an opportunity to just start to build shit
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.440]   in a new place.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.280]   And it's cool.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.200]   It's kind of like, you know, go to Mars.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.560]   It's like you get to start over.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.760]   - Yeah, and I like the hope aspect.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.720]   I think that's huge for people.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.400]   And I'm all for it.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.340]   I hope it works out.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:27.440]   I don't know if it will.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.600]   But I don't know anything about economies
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.080]   and city planning and all that shit.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.960]   So it might be too early to say, but I hope it works.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.840]   - Are you still talking about Austin or Mars?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.680]   - Austin.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.600]   Mars is, there's nothing there.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.880]   There's no vagina there.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.120]   There's no food there.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.000]   There's no water there.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:45.840]   I don't know.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.160]   It seems, I get space travel.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.080]   I think it's important, but I don't know Mars
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.540]   is really gonna move the needle.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:59.680]   - So what are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.560]   and launching rockets into space?
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.240]   - I think it's all good because you could say,
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.640]   hey, we could just feed everybody.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.240]   And I was like, yeah, that's true.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.680]   By the way, these guys give a ton of money
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.840]   to like philanthropy shit that nobody cares about.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.920]   By the way, you know, it's weird.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.760]   Like he can feed the Nigeria and with pocket change of his.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.000]   And you're like, well, maybe he has, you know?
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.840]   Like I heard Bill Gates gave back so much money
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.400]   he saved 6 million lives.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.200]   But that's a reverse Holocaust, by the way.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.320]   That's pretty good.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.160]   What have you done?
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.280]   You're a barista.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   So, you know, I just think,
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.200]   I think space travel is good because you learn
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:39.800]   about the place you're living in from going to space.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.720]   It kind of helps you learn about this more.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.400]   You could say, what's the point of going to this other there?
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.680]   But it does help, I think.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.880]   - Yeah, doing difficult things in the engineering space
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.520]   seems to be a way to develop,
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.680]   like as almost like an accident,
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.160]   as a side effect of doing a really difficult thing
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.720]   in a team of brilliant people.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.040]   You develop things like the internet.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.640]   And you could argue that the internet
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.160]   maybe is not so good for society.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.000]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.080]   - It's good and bad.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.040]   - Yeah, but--
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.000]   - But it's like a pull-up.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.240]   You're trying to get your bicep going,
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.160]   but hey, before you know it, you got decent forearms.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.440]   But you weren't working on the forearms.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.840]   You wanted the bi, but you got the fore.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.600]   And I think that's kind of what space travel is.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.440]   - I like how this pivoted into a workout routine advice.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.080]   - I'm trying to get an analogy going here.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.520]   - All right, they work pretty well.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.360]   - I'll take it.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.360]   - All right, what are your thoughts about,
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.320]   since I'm a robotics person,
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.040]   I'd be curious to see like what,
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.880]   do you think about the space at all?
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.760]   About, first of all, autonomous vehicles
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:44.760]   with Tesla Autopilot and Waymo, self-driving car.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.280]   I'm not sure if you're familiar
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.680]   with all the autonomous vehicles and so on.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.000]   So those are robots on wheels.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.920]   And then there's also legged robots.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.840]   So next time you're in Austin,
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.400]   you get to meet some of the legged robots.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.240]   - I hope to.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   - Been working on.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.640]   And I find those kind of a fascinating way
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   to explore the nature of intelligence in our computers,
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.540]   but also explore our own intelligence
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.240]   and also explore our own,
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:20.840]   like what makes us connect to other living beings,
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.000]   whether it's dogs, cats, or other humans.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.080]   Like there's some magic there
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.000]   that's beyond just intelligence.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.480]   And like when I have the robot dog,
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.520]   there's some aspect to it that, I don't know,
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.080]   brings me joy in a way that a dog does,
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.400]   in a way that a good friend does.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.240]   - Really?
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.440]   - And I'm not sure if that's some kind of anthropomorphism,
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   like where I'm projecting my hopes for what this thing is.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.680]   - Maybe a little of that.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.960]   - But it's kind of built in.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.600]   I mean, it's just a source of joy.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.480]   Maybe it's connected to the fact
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.960]   that there's just like a loneliness within all of us,
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.160]   within me, and it's just nice to have other things
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.960]   in your life that move, that recognize you,
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.840]   that kind of thing.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:09.120]   I mean, I suppose it's nice to even just have a plant.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.120]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:10.960]   Plant goes a long way.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.480]   You see a guy with plants in his apartment,
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.240]   it changes the apartment 'cause they're alive.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.080]   You gotta water 'em.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.000]   You gotta put sun on 'em.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.600]   So yeah, I think there's something there.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.720]   And I think you can see people's reactions
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.600]   when you show them advanced technology,
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.760]   like these dog robots or these robots that dance and shit.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.720]   People are like, "What the fuck?"
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.240]   Like it hits home in some way, whether it's fear
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.800]   or you wanna fuck 'em, clearly, whatever it is,
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.480]   but it does connect with you in some way.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.480]   So I'm with you.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.000]   And I think, this is why I don't think robots will take over.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.760]   You always hear that, "Robot, they're making 'em too advanced.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.880]   "They're gonna wipe us out, blah, blah, blah."
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.000]   If robots get at human emotions,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.160]   that is scary 'cause they could get mad at us and kill us
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.560]   and they're stronger and they don't need sleep,
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.720]   they don't need food, they don't need water,
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.400]   they don't get jealous, but if they have emotions,
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.400]   then I think we can dominate them
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.240]   because who knows emotions better than us?
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.800]   We've got thousands of years
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.280]   of evolutionary emotional bullshit.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.480]   We can go, "Hey, robot, I heard your wife fucked
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.320]   "that Black and Decker, huh?"
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.840]   They're gonna crumble.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.280]   We can bully them.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.880]   Emotionally manipulated robots.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.640]   Yes, that's when we'll win.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.240]   Right now, they could kill us.
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.400]   They could just, (imitates explosion)
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.960]   We'd all die, then we shoot them back.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.840]   Bing, bing, bing, bing, that's no good.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.160]   But if they do get emotions, then we can go,
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.440]   "Hey, you look like hell.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.520]   "What is that, a rusty bolt?
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.800]   "Hey, you're dropping some oil there, you loser."
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.320]   I think we can win if they do get emotions.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   - This goes back to your father being able
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.760]   to undercut you with a single word.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.600]   (laughing)
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.440]   - You're right.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.280]   - Yeah, so we're the creators of the robots
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.560]   and then the robots will just,
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.960]   you would say the exact thing where the robot would be like,
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.280]   "That son of a bitch."
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.320]   And then he goes back to his hole
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.960]   and just sits there miserable.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.880]   - Right, yeah, hardware looks more like software to me.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.080]   He can't get it up, yada, yada, yada.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.540]   But I'm not worried about robots and I think self,
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.280]   what do you think about the self-driving cars?
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.480]   Is that just wiping out the horse and buggy?
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.360]   Isn't that just progression of technology?
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.800]   - Yeah, so I don't know if you've driven in a Tesla,
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.240]   for example.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.120]   - I rode in the passenger, I didn't drive it.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.160]   - Yeah, there's several stages in that.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.880]   I think the problem is way harder than people realize
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.320]   and for quite a while, it'll just make driving more pleasant.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.720]   It'll make it less stressful,
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.680]   it'll take over some of the boring bits for you,
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.520]   it'll make it easier.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.920]   Like there's something that happens actually
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.480]   when the car is driving for you in the following way.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.800]   Like it's staying in the lane,
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.380]   it's keeping distance to the car in front of you,
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.400]   maybe it's changing lanes.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.480]   It allows you to relax a little bit.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.320]   - Yes.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.080]   - You become, you still have to be alert
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.520]   but you become like a passenger
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.320]   and you get to like take in the world.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.600]   I mean, somehow that's more relaxing
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.480]   without making you necessarily like bored more.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.880]   It energizes you more.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.600]   So I just think it makes the driving experience
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.200]   more pleasant but when you actually fully automate cars,
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.680]   when you can just completely tune out
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.040]   and start reading a book or go to sleep,
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.920]   that might change society like in ways
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.600]   we don't even understand
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.500]   because you'll have, I mean,
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:22.080]   it'll probably change the nature of roads
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.720]   because the cars, 'cause now you can be super productive
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.320]   and so it no longer quite matters to you as much
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.980]   how long it takes to get from point A to point B
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:34.360]   because you're not wasting that time,
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.320]   you just continue working.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.160]   - Yeah.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.960]   - It's like public transit that comes to you.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.060]   - Exactly.
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:43.960]   - And so there will be maybe less roads and bigger roads
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.360]   and it will just change the nature
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.320]   of how we get from point A to point B.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.160]   - I think you're right.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.400]   - But then couple that also with the fact
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.480]   that we seem to be more and more comfortable
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.160]   existing in the digital world.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.040]   - Yeah.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.120]   - So like maybe we won't wanna go outside more and more,
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.240]   we'll just interact with each other virtually.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.380]   And I don't mean Zoom meetings,
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:07.380]   I mean just in other ways that's more fulfilling
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.880]   than a Zoom meeting.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.960]   But then maybe not because like there's something
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.560]   deeply uncompelling about Zoom meetings.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.780]   Like podcasts that are remote,
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.600]   unless they're super information dense,
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.040]   at least to me as a podcast fan, kinda suck.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.320]   - They suck, there's no connection,
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.960]   it goes back to the dog thing.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.900]   With the Zoom there's no connection.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.440]   - Yeah and we're not, I don't understand why,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.720]   we're not even making eye contact.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.760]   - I know, but it's just something there,
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.080]   it's in the room, there's pheromones
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.120]   and that's like out of our understanding probably,
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.480]   just some kind of weird biological,
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.560]   you know you ever have Cheerios in a bowl?
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.200]   The Cheerios tend to, they tend to go together,
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.680]   you see a cluster of Cheerios.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.320]   They're never really hanging out on the other side
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.600]   and that's kinda how people are in real life.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.120]   - I wonder what the physics of that is.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.440]   So they come together and they stick.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.880]   - It's something with molecules.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.720]   - Yeah.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.540]   - I don't know, I can't remember what it was,
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.320]   but it was fascinating and I think that's how people are.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.920]   And I think you try to write a TV show
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:09.920]   or craft a movie with your team, Zoom, nothing there.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.860]   It's like phone sex versus penetration.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:16.160]   One day you'll learn that.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.240]   - I know nothing of either of the,
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.320]   I look forward 'cause I think there's a phone sex
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.120]   Netflix documentary that, there's a show
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.640]   or something like that that is really popular
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.960]   that I wanna go watch, at least I can learn about that.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.120]   - Okay, I could send you some links.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.480]   - Oh, on the internet?
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.800]   - Yeah.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.600]   - But yeah, self-driving car, I think it's just inevitable,
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.640]   it's coming and these truckers are gonna have
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.080]   to figure something out.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.920]   - Yeah, I mean, that's an under-understood industry,
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.360]   actually, 'cause there's not,
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.960]   there's a lot of trucking jobs.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.800]   - Oh yeah.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.440]   - And people don't wanna, well, people don't wanna
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.800]   actually take them anymore because it's such a difficult job
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:58.320]   so it won't have, or a lot of people believe it won't have
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.160]   as big of a negative impact as folks anticipate.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.000]   - Oh good.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.160]   - There'll be other automation I think
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.680]   that'll have a huge impact.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.080]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.320]   I mean, you already see it in McDonald's,
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.560]   you go to the beep, beep, beep,
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.800]   why do you wanna get yelled at by the heavyset woman
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.480]   of color for making a bad order
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.480]   when you can just hit the screen?
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.080]   But those interactions I think are human,
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.040]   I mean, that's part of life,
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.260]   so it is scary taking away everything.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.060]   How long 'til we're not fucking?
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.280]   That's coming too.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.120]   - Yeah.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.880]   - Then there's gonna have two types of people.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.360]   Are you a fuck in real life or are you a digital fuck person?
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.120]   Oh, I'm a digital, oh, I like real fucking,
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.440]   sorry, we can't date.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.540]   That's coming.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.940]   - Well, there's also the reproduction side of sex,
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.420]   which is like with genetic engineering,
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:45.980]   you'll be able to specify a little bit of details.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.780]   I talked to Jamie Marzo about that,
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:52.160]   like where you can specify,
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:58.720]   it'll start with like, I want my child not to have
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.060]   like a high likelihood of diabetes or something like that.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.740]   And then you just get to specify like intelligence,
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:07.100]   you just get to specify those kinds of parameters
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:10.940]   until you're like basically trying to create a perfect human
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.580]   and you lose some of the magic of the flaws
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:13.700]   that make us who we are.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:14.660]   - Yes.
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:19.300]   - And I'm pretty sure in the full lineup of humans,
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:23.620]   so let me give you some information.
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:24.860]   - Lay it off me, buddy.
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:25.700]   Break it down.
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:29.460]   - I'm sure you researched this thoroughly,
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:33.860]   but a male of the human species,
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:38.860]   the homo sapien, produces 500 billion sperm cells
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:41.620]   in a lifetime.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:45.420]   So that's all, some more than others,
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:51.500]   that's all genetically unique humans that you could produce.
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.640]   So even across those 500 billion, you can select.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.820]   - What do you mean, like abort some?
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:00.380]   - No, you can choose which of them you want.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:03.020]   I mean, just imagine all the genetic possibilities
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.020]   that are there, like all the possible,
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.940]   like you won the race.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:08.780]   - Yes.
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.620]   Shocking.
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:11.460]   - Yeah, this is a winner.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.020]   - You won out of all the 500 billion?
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.620]   - You have to imagine what the competition was.
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:19.940]   - Oh, just tarts all day long, handicap.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:23.100]   - Well, so it's not actually the fastest sperm
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:26.340]   or like it's, I think a lot of it is timing and luck.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.040]   What it seems like.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.180]   There's actual papers on this
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.940]   and I've actually been reading them.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:31.940]   - I hope so.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.100]   - So it's not just like the fastest sperm to the egg.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:34.940]   - Okay.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:36.300]   - There's a timing thing.
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.980]   So you were just lucky.
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.540]   - All right, I believe that.
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:41.740]   - So it's interesting to think about,
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:44.060]   like once you're able to specify
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:49.220]   some parameters of what your child is like,
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.560]   how that changes the nature of,
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:57.780]   even just like the intimacy of two humans getting together
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:02.320]   and making, creating together a child.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.160]   - Yeah.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.640]   - I mean, it changes it.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.040]   It's almost like, I don't know,
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.720]   it becomes like a factory line of some kind.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.920]   - If you don't meet naturally.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.560]   - Yeah, if you don't meet naturally
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.640]   and then you don't and you get to optimize your child,
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.480]   then it's--
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.320]   - Yeah.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.880]   - Then it's something like you have to consider
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.480]   utilitarian type of things, like what's good for society
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.280]   and it'll probably be regulation
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.560]   about what kind of children you can have and not.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.220]   Like your child cannot have an IQ below this
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.160]   or above this or something like that.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.760]   Or your child cannot--
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:39.240]   - We already kind of do that with VIP clubs,
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.960]   like, "Ah, you're kind of ugly."
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.320]   Or women go, "Hey, he's not tall enough."
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.560]   We kind of do it a little.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.400]   - Yeah.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.600]   - Especially sexually.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.440]   - Yeah, we do.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.720]   - Can't get on the roller coaster,
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.160]   if you're this short, whatever it is.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.760]   You know, we do it in some capacity.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:57.120]   - But here, this would be like fully transparent
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.080]   and to a degree that it's hard to imagine.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.000]   Like the way we currently do it,
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.760]   you can at least get around it.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.600]   - Yes, yes.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.000]   - You can at least trick your way onto the roller coaster,
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.200]   even if you're short.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.280]   - Right, or the fat guy can get rich so he can get laid.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.720]   You know, there's other ways.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.600]   - At the risk of asking the totally wrong person
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.600]   this question, what advice would you give
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.080]   to young people today in high school and college
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.800]   about how to have a successful career
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.640]   or career they're proud of
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.920]   or maybe have a life that they're proud of?
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.360]   - Ooh.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.280]   Well, first of all, you gotta be,
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.800]   you gotta want a life you're proud of.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.400]   Not everybody has any integrity.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.520]   A lot of people just want short money.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:44.680]   I wanna feel good, look good right now.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.360]   I wanna do Molly, boom, I'll feel good, you know?
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.600]   But you should space it out.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.200]   It's almost like saving money so you can use it later.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.360]   Nobody wants to save money.
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.000]   What do they say, like 11% of America
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.360]   actually has money saved, $1,000 or some shit?
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.520]   It's wildly low.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.320]   Everybody wants it now, now, what do you call it,
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.200]   immediate gratification.
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.320]   I think the key to happiness and satisfaction
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.960]   is working for something, even if it's, it's like a baby.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.640]   If you could have a baby in five minutes,
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.760]   if a woman, you got her, you jizzed in her
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.320]   and she had a baby, oh, five minutes, boom,
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.280]   newborn, healthy, I think you'd be more likely
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.840]   to throw it away.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.240]   If you could make it that quick.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.520]   It's the fact that you spent nine months
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.240]   backbreaking the labor, the lactating,
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.080]   the ripped placenta and the hymen or whatever the fuck,
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.640]   that's what makes you love it.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:38.880]   And I think it's the same with comedy
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.480]   or making money or whatever.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.760]   Look at these kids who like child stars.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.080]   They all become heroin addicts at like 22
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.440]   because they've just, their sensors are burned out,
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.400]   their pleasure sensors, you didn't have to earn it.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.760]   I think earning it is a big part of life
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.600]   and always try to do better, try to do more,
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.160]   try to learn new things.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.600]   Hey, I'm bored, life sucks, play the piano then, you chooch.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.040]   But you won't do it because it takes effort
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.560]   and failure and all that, but that's the good part.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.280]   And I know it's hard to see.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.800]   So I think that's a good key to life
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.040]   is work hard at something you care about
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.360]   and then love the result.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.760]   The hard work, the journey is actually way more important
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.960]   than just getting something.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.320]   Everybody wants to go on Amazon, I got a package,
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.800]   then you feel good for 10 seconds
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.800]   and all right, let's go on Amazon again.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.760]   And then it's just a dumb cycle
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.520]   of you being disgusting and gluttonous.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.960]   So work for it.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.920]   Everybody wants to take steroids and just, I'm buff.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.840]   Why'd you point at me?
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.680]   Well, I'm just saying.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:42.520]   'Cause I'm Russian or what?
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:45.560]   Well, I saw the Icarus.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.320]   But no, I'm not saying you're on Roids,
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.800]   I'm just, you'd be way bigger.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:52.520]   But I'm just saying, work for something
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:56.560]   and then I would also, young people, eat shit early.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.800]   Eat shit early.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.760]   I know a guy who kind of got canceled or whatever
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.320]   and he had an out early, but he tried to get by
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.200]   and he tried to ride it and it all came crumbling down.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.400]   But if he had eaten it early, like yeah, I fucked up,
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:12.360]   I did that, whatever it was,
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.480]   he would have just kind of been shit on for a month
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.520]   and then it would have gone away.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.920]   But now it's his whole identity and that sucks.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.200]   So eat shit early and I know it's hard to see.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.240]   What do you mean early?
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.520]   I'm in the present.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:28.240]   But look ahead, look back, this time will pass.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.620]   I mean, look at high school.
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.280]   High school was the biggest thing in our lives.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.920]   Oh my God, this exam, Susie Q hates me,
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.600]   the football player beat me up, oh, I'll never recover.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:37.680]   Now you don't even think about high school,
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.440]   it's just a blip in your dumb life.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.520]   And that's what this is now, this will just be a blip.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.160]   So remember that and work towards something
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.480]   and work hard and care about the result.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.160]   If the result isn't good, try it again
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.800]   and failure is not always bad.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.680]   Failure, we look at failure as this end all, be all.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.840]   My life's over, I failed.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.080]   But failure is really just learning.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:01.920]   So that's something.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.680]   - So in summary, eat shit early and eat shit often.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:07.800]   - Yes.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.840]   - All right, Mark Norman.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.960]   - Eat ass.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.080]   - That's escalated quickly.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.020]   All right, I have a list of random questions for you.
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.520]   What activities make you lose track of time?
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.360]   - Ooh.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.280]   - Have that, go into that zone.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.960]   You have this happiness, contentment about you
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.820]   that you just truly enjoy.
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:31.240]   - Yeah, I think a good conversation,
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.360]   like I'll sit at the comedy cellar with friends,
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.700]   maybe a little whiskey's flowing.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:40.040]   And when you're really just vibing and inhib, inhib,
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.680]   in, in a biddy?
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.520]   - You can do it.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.360]   - What is it?
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.200]   Inhibited. - Inhibition.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.400]   Inhibited. - Uninhibited.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.240]   - Uninhibited.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.560]   - When you're just vibing and you're uninhibited
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.520]   and you're saying crazy shit and you're laughing
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.480]   and you're not worried, am I seeming cool right now?
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.840]   Am I seeming likable?
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.040]   When you're just you, 100%, and it's all coming out of you,
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.080]   and then they're saying stuff and you go back and forth
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.280]   and you feel that excitement.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.840]   Oh, they're talking, but I wanna say my thing.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.600]   And you know, you get all keyed up.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.440]   I love that.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.520]   And I look at my watch, I'm like,
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.000]   fuck, it's three in the morning.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.760]   We've been talking for five hours.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.080]   So I love that.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.860]   That makes the time fly by.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.360]   Also, I bought a, speaking of self-driving cars,
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:17.700]   I bought a 1973 BMW car,
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.840]   and it's classic and it's stick shift
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.160]   and it's grizzly and gritty and rusty,
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.520]   and it's a bucket of bolts, but I love driving it.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.800]   - Bucket of bolts.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.880]   - Yeah. - You and Tom Waits
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.840]   are poets.
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:32.400]   - Have you taken a long trip anywhere,
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.960]   like road trip in your life or with this BMW?
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.400]   - Not with it, it's pretty new, but I will.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.760]   - It's a new 1973.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.040]   - Yeah, it's new to me.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.480]   And it just, it goes in the face
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.520]   of everything we're doing now.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.160]   Everything is digital, everything is automated,
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.000]   everything is hands-off, everything is delivered.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.720]   And this is the most hands-on thing in the world.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.160]   And I am dialed in, man.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.320]   I got the tachometer, I keep an eye on that.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.440]   Oh, I put the wrong gear in, shit.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.940]   Oh, it's about to stall, put some gas, put some clutch.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:04.320]   And it's all just brain power
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.780]   and staying in focus and all that.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.500]   And it's the opposite of tweeting and texting
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.840]   and watching porn or whatever.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.160]   So I almost needed that in my life,
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.840]   so I bought this car just to have this little exercise.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:21.080]   - I hope you don't mind that I'm just trying out
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.080]   random questions I wrote on you that are completely,
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.800]   they're like completely insane.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.720]   - I'm a guinea pig, jizz in my face.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.080]   Bring it on, baby.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:32.520]   - This would be edited down to five minutes.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.920]   If everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left,
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.640]   what would your days look like?
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.740]   What would you do?
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.480]   - That's tough, 'cause I'm already an introvert
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.520]   and I try to avoid people mostly.
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.240]   Like I like a one-on-one,
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:50.520]   but crowds and all that is tough.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.600]   So- - So basically unchanged?
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:53.920]   - Yeah, that's what I was gonna say,
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.320]   but then that's the irony is I would be so sad
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.240]   to not talk to anybody.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.760]   So it's this weird, bittersweet thing,
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.980]   but I don't know what I would do, man.
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:04.000]   I guess it's kind of like when you're hung over,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.380]   you just go into the primal survival mode.
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:12.380]   I gotta get food, I need water, I'm horny, jerk off.
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.040]   You just go, you're not like playing the piano
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.840]   or painting or at the gym.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.360]   So I think I would just go into urges, man, primal urges.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:24.100]   Find food, store food.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:24.940]   Am I safe?
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:28.840]   Make weapons, build a shelter that I can't get attacked in.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.360]   I would go all survival mode.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.240]   And then once I maybe realized if I was safe or not,
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.080]   there's no wild roaming dogs, I would start exploring
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:42.080]   and maybe somehow get a vehicle and I would try to expand
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.880]   and that would be it.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.200]   And maybe I'd journal.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:49.280]   - Exploring to what, to try to find new experiences?
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.320]   - New life, if there's other,
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.160]   maybe there is another guy out there.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.720]   - Oh, so always there's a possibility.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:56.840]   - Yeah, hope.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.920]   And then maybe there's a better place I could live.
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:01.080]   Let's find that and then moving on.
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.140]   Maybe there's more food over here.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.480]   So yeah, the hope would drive me.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:07.200]   But it would be bleak and sad and horrible also.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.820]   - So what you're saying is you really want other people
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.760]   to be there so you can hide from them.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.000]   - Yes, yes, well said.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.840]   - All right, what's an item on your bucket list
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.200]   that you haven't done yet?
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.600]   Think about something you'd be very upset if you died
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.720]   and you haven't done.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.240]   - Well, I'm terrified of having kids,
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.760]   just 'cause I'm a child myself
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.880]   and I'm selfish and lazy in a way.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.560]   So kids are like, this is your whole life now, this is it.
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.880]   You gotta not let this thing die.
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.940]   You gotta love it, you gotta raise it.
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.480]   So kids scare the shit out of me,
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.080]   but I also feel like if I don't have them,
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.840]   I'll regret it.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.840]   - Well, you've seen so many people like you
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.960]   who are fundamentally changed by kids.
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:53.960]   Like it's a source of, like a deep source of happiness,
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.880]   even though you didn't anticipate it.
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.280]   - Yeah.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.800]   - So you penciled it into your bucket list.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.840]   - Yes, yes.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.640]   - It might be on there, okay.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.480]   - You want kids?
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.180]   - Yeah, well, I want kids, I wanna get married,
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:10.240]   I wanna have kids.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:15.240]   I kinda, I don't like choice, so in the following way,
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.480]   like I appreciate the value of scarcity
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.520]   and the power of scarcity.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.120]   Like I don't like the modern dating culture.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:23.600]   It's not some religious thing or whatever.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.200]   I just like one girl for a long time,
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.640]   or at least swinging for that always,
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:30.160]   like swinging for the fences.
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.720]   - But you could be swinging right now.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:32.560]   I mean, you're--
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.000]   - That's a different use of the word swinging.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:34.840]   - Sure, sure.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.680]   But I'm saying, you could be, you look great,
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.960]   you're handsome, muscular. - Yeah, thank you.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.800]   Thank you.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.760]   - You got a good job done, so I feel like
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.640]   you wouldn't leave without an orgasm on her.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:45.480]   - Yeah, but I just like to, you know, I bought furries.
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.480]   I like to dress up as animals,
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.040]   and I just have trouble finding others who like the same.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:50.880]   - Ah, they're up there.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.320]   I could show you some chat rooms.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.620]   - You're also my coach for the internet, okay.
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:58.040]   What are you most afraid of?
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:01.960]   - I guess on unlived life,
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:07.620]   I'm always a big fan growing up of like wild guys,
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:09.600]   you know, like these Teddy Roosevelt's
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.240]   who would go out and hunt lions,
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:14.560]   and like bar fighting guys.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.560]   I was obsessed with Hunter S. Thompson types.
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:21.960]   And look, this is what I love about guys like,
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.580]   who's a good example?
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.760]   Like Hemingway.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.400]   Hemingway was the manliest guy.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.860]   He had the rifle, and the elephant gun, and the whiskey,
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.700]   and the writing, and the women, and the fist fights.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.960]   But people forget that the other side of that coin
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:36.260]   is I'm sure he was in a lot of hotel rooms weeping.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.800]   I'm sure he was lonely as fuck.
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.360]   I'm sure he had some wicked hangovers.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.720]   I mean, he killed himself for Christ's sake.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.960]   So obviously he was dealing with something.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.760]   So the key to me is having this adventurous life,
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.020]   living to the fullest, doing crazy shit,
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:52.560]   scaring yourself, but also not killing yourself.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:56.160]   Like also not hating, 'cause I used to party a lot hard.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.840]   I used to bang a lot of gals.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.320]   And the flip side is like, this girl hates you now,
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.880]   or you got herpes, or you're hungover,
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.520]   or your mom is like, where are you?
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.520]   You never call me anymore.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.880]   You're like, oh, my mom, I let Ty's go with my mom.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.840]   I gotta connect.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.720]   So there's a horrible side to the party animal.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:18.440]   The Keith Richards we don't see is not pretty.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.160]   I mean, he's already weird looking,
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.140]   but he's partying, he's smoking, he's living.
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.340]   But there's another side of that coin.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:28.680]   And I think the key to life is living that fucking crazy,
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:33.200]   awesome, badass life, and also having some meaning
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.360]   and a little bit of, what's the word?
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.880]   Not just not killing yourself, not going sad,
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.160]   not being depressed.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.160]   There's a medium there, a sweet spot.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.960]   Does that make sense?
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:46.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:51.800]   So taking big leaps and Hemingway grabbing life by the balls
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.800]   but at the same time not crushing the balls.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.640]   Does that metaphor work at all?
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.280]   Perfect, like Evel Knievel, we all know him.
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:02.360]   What a badass, fearless, oh man, what a cool dude.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.920]   He's got balls of steel, but he also lived
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:08.760]   the back half of his life in a fucking Barca lounger
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.240]   where his legs were made of steel
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:13.200]   and he couldn't see straight and his dick didn't work.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.580]   So you know what I mean?
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:18.180]   You gotta have a balance, but you still want the balance.
[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:20.920]   I'm willing to take a little bit of shit
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:25.920]   for a little bit of fun, but you don't wanna go too hard.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.160]   You gotta still risk it.
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.440]   I mean, Hunter S. Thompson, it didn't end well.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.240]   It was quite a ride.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.320]   Quite a ride.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.920]   What small act of kindness were you once shown
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.280]   that you will never forget?
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.480]   Wow, that's a great question.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.040]   I just wrote these for the guinea pig.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:45.880]   You're the guinea pig.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.080]   That's great, that's a keeper.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.160]   Okay, that's a keeper?
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.280]   This is where we're like workshopping questions here.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.400]   All right, I'll take it.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.520]   Now you're open biking.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.200]   This is your version.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:57.600]   Let's see, there's a couple of ladies in high school
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.960]   who were kind enough to hand job me.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.760]   That was nice, which I really appreciate.
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.600]   I don't think women know how much that means to us.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.360]   You know, women are like, "Oh, I'm not a piece of meat,"
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.440]   or whatever, and you're like, "I know,
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.000]   "but if you'd just give me a hand job,
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:10.880]   "it would make my world."
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.560]   It's like telling a kid he's smart or loved.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.440]   See, most people mention a math teacher in middle school
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.000]   that inspired them to get into science.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.240]   Give a shout out to the--
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.520]   Well, that's part of it.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.360]   That's not the nicest,
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.200]   but I'm just saying that goes a long way.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.160]   All right.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.720]   Let's see, kindness.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.240]   That's a great question.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:32.240]   Ah, I wanna give you a good answer.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.000]   I got lost when I was like six.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.720]   I was walking around my dad,
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.640]   and I zoned out and went away.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.440]   And next thing you know, I don't know where I am.
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.320]   I'm in a neighborhood.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.880]   This old guy finds me crying on a lawn somewhere,
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.840]   and he goes, "Come inside,"
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.840]   and he tried to call my parents, and nothing came of it.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.640]   Eventually, they found me.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.560]   After like nine hours, cops were there,
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.920]   the FBI's out there, fucking helicopters.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.160]   And I guess that's nice.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.280]   This old guy took me in for a couple hours
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.240]   and just sat me down and kept me safe.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.120]   That's something.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.360]   Oh, how about Enos, my transvestite nanny?
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.320]   Very kind.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.360]   He, did you hear about this?
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.200]   No.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.960]   Okay, we had this transvestite nanny
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.200]   who was like a drag queen,
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.680]   but it was in the '90s, so it was weird.
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.840]   It was new.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:25.440]   And my bike got stolen, and he,
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.280]   you know, my parents were like,
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.120]   "Eh, what are you gonna do?
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.760]   "You're poor kids," you know?
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.160]   And he was like, "Fuck it, we're gonna go get that bike."
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.760]   And I was like, "This guy's in a wig and high heels.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.000]   "Big black guy."
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.120]   And I'm like, "Ah, what are you gonna do?
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.040]   "You know, it's gone."
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.360]   And he's like, "No, we're gonna go get it."
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.040]   So we got in the van and drove around my neighborhood,
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.240]   saw the kids, fucking with the bike, you know,
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:49.200]   five street toughs, and he goes,
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.040]   "All right, you wanna come out, or should I just do this?"
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.640]   And I was like, "You do it, I'm terrified.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.000]   "What are you, crazy?"
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.920]   And he got out of the van in full, you know, heels and wig,
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.840]   and he went up to these guys, and they went off.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.520]   "Oh my God, look at this fucking guy, homo, faggot,"
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.520]   all this shit, you know, it's the '90s.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.560]   And he just stared at 'em long enough
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:10.520]   to where they were kinda like,
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.640]   "All right, well, I guess we're gonna fight you now."
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.880]   And he goes, "That's not your bike."
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.520]   And they go, "What are you gonna do about it?"
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.760]   And he puts his hand on the middle of the bike,
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.280]   and they didn't do anything, and he just picked it up
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.440]   and said, "That's what I thought."
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.880]   Put the bike over his shoulder,
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:27.120]   slid the van door open, threw the bike in, and we drove off.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.560]   - Somebody stuck up for you.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.040]   - Yeah, and he coulda got, I mean, they had tools.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.820]   They coulda fucking tuned him up, two seconds.
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.960]   - That actually takes courage.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:41.200]   - Oh yeah, real courage.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.040]   - And then the reason you do and act like that
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:48.760]   is that makes a kid like you feel like
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:50.040]   there's somebody on your side.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.200]   That's powerful. - Yes.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.760]   Someone on your side is big.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.600]   - Is big.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.880]   - That goes a long way,
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.840]   especially when they have the risk
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.080]   of getting their ass kicked or their job taken away
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.020]   or whatever it is.
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:05.400]   - Now we're gonna get philosophical,
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.540]   maybe a little bit emotional.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:12.680]   Would you rather lose all your old memories
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.080]   or never be able to make new ones?
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:22.840]   - It's a tough one, but I'd go easy answer, make new ones.
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.600]   - But don't you think all the shitty things
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.960]   that happened to you--
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.840]   - Oh, so my hard drive is wiped clean.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:34.320]   Is it memories or is it how every memory affected me too?
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.760]   - I mean, this is a very--
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:36.840]   - Or do they go hand in hand?
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.400]   - I think the reality about memories
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.760]   is you replay them often.
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:43.560]   You go back to them, even when you're not aware of it.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.480]   You really go back often.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.600]   - And they change.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:48.420]   You change 'em too.
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:50.460]   - Yeah, you change them to suit
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.040]   your understanding of the world.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:52.880]   - Yes.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:58.280]   - The dark you you have, both the hope
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.880]   and the cynicism you have about the world
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:04.360]   is so deeply grounded in the memories
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.800]   that you're basically, I would say,
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.440]   if you erase all memories,
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.840]   I think you're really starting over
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.800]   with maybe the wisdom of how the world works,
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.440]   but not so much your personality is gone.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.680]   You would really,
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.840]   it'd be interesting how your comedy would change.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.520]   Maybe you would have a good sense of timing.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:30.520]   You would have a good sense of the writing process maybe.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:33.240]   But like--
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.440]   - Now you're making some good points,
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.280]   but let me ask you this.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.800]   Let's say I go to Lake Cuomo with my girlfriend.
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:43.020]   Now, I wipe the memory, or I keep my old memories.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.640]   Let's say I go to the Tuscany with the lady.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.080]   I just won't remember that?
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.080]   - Yeah, but you get to experience it in the moment.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.920]   - Okay.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:51.740]   - You get to enjoy it.
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:53.200]   - And I look at a photo of it?
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.840]   - Yes.
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:56.880]   - But I was like, what the hell is this?
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.720]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.960]   - Oh, fascinating.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:01.960]   - It's exact, the rules are pretty simple.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.800]   - Yeah.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.320]   - I think everyone knows how the rules go.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.640]   So you would, yeah, so what--
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:08.540]   - Well, I was gonna say start new ones,
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:11.360]   but then I realized I wouldn't be who I was without them.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.200]   That's what you're saying.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.040]   So I guess I'd keep 'em.
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.800]   'Cause I am 38, so I've gotten a good chunk out of life.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:20.960]   - Yeah, and let's be honest, how many years do you have left?
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.800]   - I know, right?
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.620]   I got AIDS.
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:25.420]   - Is it better to have loved,
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.940]   okay, this question is ridiculous.
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.140]   Is it better to have loved and lost
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:31.320]   or to have never loved at all?
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:34.540]   It sounds cliche, but there's a question.
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:36.740]   - Definitely better to loss.
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:38.420]   - So you enjoy the ups and downs.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.920]   - Yeah, that's life.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.280]   Sun and rain, baby.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.660]   - I kinda like both, the whole thing.
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:49.100]   The loss, every time you lose something,
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.760]   it really makes you distinctly realize
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.220]   how much you valued it.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:55.060]   - Yes.
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:57.540]   - Like in my, when I'm sad,
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:00.340]   like when I'm feeling alone
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:03.220]   and I'm sitting there alone at home
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.700]   and I wish I could hang out with somebody,
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:10.540]   that's like a realization how awesome people are.
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:11.660]   - Yeah.
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:15.540]   - So it's like the missing, the, yeah.
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.300]   - We don't have a lot of that in life anymore
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:19.340]   because we can have anything we want immediately.
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:20.720]   So the missing has gone away,
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.280]   which again drives down the joy of having it.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.480]   So I think you're right, you need both.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.180]   - So like you said, you have a condition
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:34.340]   that a terminal condition, not many years left.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:35.700]   Do you think about your mortality?
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.540]   You think about that?
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:38.740]   - Oh, all day, every day.
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:39.580]   - Are you afraid?
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.400]   - Not afraid 'cause it's inevitable.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.480]   So it's more like, how are we gonna handle this?
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:47.740]   It's like the winter is coming,
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:50.260]   let's stock up on some fucking nuts.
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:51.660]   - But the existential nature of it,
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:53.500]   like the fact that this ride ends,
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.460]   like what the hell are you doing any of this for?
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:56.300]   Like 'cause it--
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:58.540]   - Satisfaction, happiness.
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:02.480]   - Short term, but like there is a presumption there
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.360]   that it kind of goes on forever.
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:07.380]   I think if you truly think about the fact that it ends--
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:10.780]   - Your brain almost shuts it down.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:12.500]   - Yeah, there's some kind of like protective
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:15.380]   like switch that just goes off.
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.500]   I mean, that's why the Stoics, you know,
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.660]   encourage people to meditate on death
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:24.100]   'cause it somehow reorganizes your priorities.
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:26.220]   It helps you like, holy shit,
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.340]   this ends, make the most of the day.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.180]   - Yes.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.000]   - It's just a nice thing,
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.200]   but still you can't quite comprehend that the thing ends.
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:36.100]   - Little things too, you know, people go like,
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:38.660]   oh, we got a layover between our flights,
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:40.420]   it's an hour, what are we gonna do for an hour?
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:41.860]   It's like, what do you mean, what are you gonna do
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:42.700]   for an hour?
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:43.740]   You're gonna kill an hour.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:46.380]   How are we gonna kill this hour?
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.420]   This is part of your life.
[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:48.260]   You're just trying to get rid of it,
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:49.180]   you're just trying to kill it.
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:50.220]   That always blew my mind.
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.860]   Like, hey, fuck it, let's hit the airport bar.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:55.900]   Let's get a candy bar or something.
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:57.180]   Anything with bar.
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:00.500]   But it's just, you gotta live.
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.980]   I hate this, like, how are we gonna burn,
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:04.220]   oh, the bar didn't open for 15 minutes.
[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:05.040]   What are we gonna do?
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:06.020]   Well, we got 15 minutes.
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:07.620]   We got the world is our oyster.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:09.220]   - Yeah, make the most of it.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.900]   And like you said, in modern day,
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:13.780]   actually the boredom is a gift.
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:16.540]   Like, when you're waiting for something,
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:18.500]   that's a gift.
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:20.460]   You get to be with your thoughts.
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:21.380]   - Yeah.
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.780]   - Those are the same thoughts you'll have
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:24.420]   when you're on your deathbed.
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:25.800]   There won't be a,
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.740]   you won't be scrolling TikTok on your deathbed.
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:30.820]   - I hope not, Jesus.
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:33.220]   - You'd be a lot more, actually, maybe you would be.
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:34.220]   - What a sad existence.
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:35.940]   - 'Cause it would be a good,
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:37.500]   like, content creators would be like,
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.180]   ooh, I'm dying, this would be good content.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:40.620]   (laughing)
[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:43.580]   - Yeah, I wanna be able to film the exact moment it goes,
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:44.620]   beeep.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:46.420]   - Like, last words, I wonder what my last words will be.
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:47.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:50.900]   - It's a good way to end the account with a bang.
[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:52.340]   - Yep, I like that.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.580]   Well, you know, have you ever seen that meme
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:54.660]   where the old guy in bed, he goes,
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:58.480]   I wish I had tweeted more, you know, and then he dies.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.460]   It's so true.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:00.660]   - Could be the future.
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:02.700]   What do you think is the meaning of life?
[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:06.060]   - I don't think there is one.
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.820]   Everybody always throws that out there.
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:08.660]   There isn't a meaning.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.100]   I think we're here, we're lucky to be here.
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:13.060]   I think there's no afterlife, there's no heaven.
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:16.060]   That's all shit we tell ourselves to feel better.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.540]   And I think you gotta just, it's like saying,
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:23.300]   what is the meaning of this food I made?
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.100]   Well, it's just, you enjoy the food,
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:26.540]   you try to get the most out of it.
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:30.060]   You built the food, you prepared it.
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:33.420]   So just get what you can out of it.
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.260]   Don't die.
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:38.580]   And try to make it last as long as possible.
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:39.860]   - Yeah, but you look at Earth.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:42.500]   It's like four billion years old.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:47.500]   And life started early on, like simple cell bacteria life,
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.860]   like one billion years in.
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.860]   And then it started like having lots
[01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:54.860]   of aggressive interaction.
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.500]   Eventually there's predator and prey,
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:59.300]   and then there's sex, lots of sex, lots of sex.
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:00.260]   Lots of violence.
[01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:01.460]   - Oh yeah.
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:03.780]   - And then, you know, through natural selection,
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.540]   there's just a whole evolutionary process
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:09.180]   of animals that have loved and lost
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:11.220]   and murdered and gotten murdered
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:12.060]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:14.380]   And it's somehow led to human civilization.
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:17.140]   We're super busy trying to create things
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:20.260]   and creating beautiful art, creating beautiful comedy.
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:21.460]   - Yeah.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:23.660]   - Just always creating something new.
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:26.420]   It feels like it's tending towards something.
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:28.580]   - It's not dying.
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:31.780]   If you die tomorrow, you still have all these hours of pots.
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:33.660]   So it's kind of, you think you're cheating death
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.700]   in a subconscious way, I think.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.540]   - Right.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.580]   You know who Ernest Becker is?
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:39.680]   - I've heard the name.
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:42.060]   - It's a book called "The Now of Death."
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:46.300]   This idea that if you don't acknowledge--
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:47.300]   - Book's on my shelf.
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:49.460]   - Girls love it.
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:51.140]   - Really? - Like Dostoevsky.
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:53.380]   No, I'm just saying.
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:54.980]   You wanna bring Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:57.140]   Russian literature, back to Norm.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:01.140]   It's good to bring to, 'cause no American
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:02.400]   has read any Russian literature,
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.580]   but they all appreciate it if you bring it.
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:05.860]   And it's not like they're gonna ask you
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:08.020]   any legitimate questions, 'cause they haven't read it.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.660]   So you can always pretend like you've read it.
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.500]   So it's a--
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.280]   - It's a little dense.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:14.340]   Can we get a shortened version?
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:15.180]   - Cliff Notes.
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:18.340]   - Yes, or make a movie with Ben Stiller
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:21.300]   that I can just go, oh, this is based on,
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.260]   what is it, "Life and Death"?
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:24.100]   No, what's the one?
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:24.920]   "War and Peace."
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:25.760]   - "War and Peace."
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:28.740]   Yeah, so Ernest Becker's theory,
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:31.180]   and there's this whole terror management theory
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:34.500]   that basically says that our terror of death,
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:39.060]   our fear of death is one of the central creative forces
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:40.300]   of the human condition.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:43.260]   It's the reason we're trying to, yeah, cheat death.
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:44.900]   We're trying to delude ourself
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:47.540]   that somehow we can become immortal through our art.
[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:49.700]   It's why you've uploaded your special to YouTube,
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:53.260]   'cause you think your special will outlive
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:54.580]   all of human civilization.
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:57.340]   You think YouTube will outlive all of human civilization.
[01:48:57.340 --> 01:48:58.580]   - That could go away tomorrow.
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:00.260]   - That can go away tomorrow.
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:04.340]   All of this can go away, so I'm truly grateful,
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.840]   Mr. Mark Norman, that you would spend
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:09.040]   your very valuable time with me today,
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.500]   even though it could all go away.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.500]   This could be the last day of our lives,
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:16.300]   and won't you be quite upset this is how you spent it?
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:18.860]   - Ah, yeah, in your hotel room, what am I?
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:20.180]   You're like Harvey Weinstein here.
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:22.660]   You heard me up, and now I feel fucked.
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:23.500]   (laughing)
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:26.060]   - Just wait what we have ready for you
[01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:27.460]   after the podcast is over.
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:28.300]   (laughing)
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:29.820]   All right, brother, thanks so much for talking today.
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:32.080]   - Thank you, it was great, comedy.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.940]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.100]   with Mark Norman.

[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:44.660]   from Mark Norman himself on his Twitter,
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:47.860]   which you should definitely follow because it's hilarious.
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:51.340]   The worst thing about getting Omicron for Christmas
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:53.360]   is you know it was regifted.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.260]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:00.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:03.420]   (upbeat music)
