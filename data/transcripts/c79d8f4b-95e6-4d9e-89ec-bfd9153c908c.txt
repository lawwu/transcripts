[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.300]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.160]   in the right direction.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.020]   For episode two, I wanted to lay the foundation for other episodes and address the concept
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740]   of truth and flesh out some of its implications.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.700]   I know at first glance this might seem unnecessary, but in an age where postmodernism has reached
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.820]   its tentacles into even casual conversations, even inner thinking, I thought it would be
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.980]   important some groundwork was laid.
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.100]   After all, we're in an era where the mantra of postmodernism, that all truth is relative
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.380]   or all truth is subjective, has reached cultural acceptance.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.020]   In many cases, it's not enough to be merely sympathetic, but a lot of times it means to
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.900]   bow the knee.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.500]   Along with this, the privatization of moral values has completed the recipe that has led
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.260]   to the end of any objective search for truth being considered a noble task.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.220]   Moreover, the sharing of lives with someone who espouses a differing ideology than you
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.900]   once considered the norm for sophisticated and civil people has been displaced and now
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.620]   the opposite is actually true.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.180]   It is political anathema to treat another person who has a differing ideology as fully
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.860]   human.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.980]   For example, did you know that the two late United States Supreme Court Justices, Antonin
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:18.340]   Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, they considered each other best friends.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.940]   We're talking about two icons of their own respective judicial philosophies that are
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.260]   completely at odds with one another.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.940]   One is considered by many to be a conservative icon.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.020]   Another is considered by many to be a liberal icon.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:44.660]   But these two intellectual giants shared life together and they came from a time where that
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.900]   was the norm for how sophisticated and civilized people behaved and conducted themselves.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.140]   Now that type of thinking is extinct like the woolly mammoth.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.520]   It is more acceptable to hate someone who has a differing ideology than you.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.020]   And if you don't toe the line, you eventually end up getting canceled.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.520]   We live in a cancel culture.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.200]   And you see that with Ellen DeGeneres and with J.K.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   Rowling.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.800]   In any case, going back to our discussion of truth, let's start with defining truth
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.740]   and work out from there.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.640]   In order for us to have a discussion about truth or true, we need to have a working definition
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.180]   that we all agree upon.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.600]   So here's a Merriam-Webster entry for truth.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.880]   Entry number one, the body of real things, events and facts, actuality.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.300]   Number two, the state of being the case, fact.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.360]   Number three, a transcendent fundamental or spiritual reality.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.200]   To A, the property as of a statement of being in accord with fact or reality.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.280]   Let me read that again.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.840]   It is the body of real things, events and facts, actuality.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.640]   The state of being the case, fact.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.920]   A transcendent fundamental or spiritual reality, or the property as of a statement of being
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.660]   in accord with fact or reality.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.200]   Isn't it interesting that despite this being the dictionary definition of truth or true,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.120]   we could still hold to some following notions.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.680]   What's true for you is not what's true for me.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.480]   Or that's your truth.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.280]   In many cases when people state this, they could very easily be misspeaking and inserting
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.000]   the word truth for some other word like taste or opinion.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.180]   But undoubtedly our culture has so privatized and declared truth to be subjective when by
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:07.100]   definition truth is a transcendent fundamental and/or the body of real things.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.640]   So by virtue of the definition I just stated, here are some things that truth is not.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.920]   Truth is not necessarily what makes you feel good or better.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.300]   Truth is not necessarily what the majority says is true.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.200]   Truth is not necessarily good intentions.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.260]   Truth is not necessarily what the consensus is.
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.220]   Truth is not necessarily what is the most pragmatic or practical.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.440]   It is not what makes you feel good or better necessarily, what the majority says is true
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.140]   necessarily, good intentions necessarily, what the consensus is necessarily, whatever
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.880]   is the most pragmatic or practical necessarily.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:57.600]   Here are some qualities of truth that truth possesses inherently or intrinsically by nature
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.000]   of being truth.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:11.560]   By nature, truth is exclusive, fixed, corresponds to reality, and by extension of the first
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.320]   three it withstands the test of scrutiny.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:24.440]   It is exclusive, it is fixed, it corresponds to reality, and by virtue of that it withstands
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.120]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.560]   I want to give you some examples of these intrinsic qualities to illustrate the points
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.240]   that I just made.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:42.840]   Truth is exclusive because two thoughts existing on the same wavelength cannot both be true.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.040]   To say it another way, truth is exclusive because two thoughts on the same plane of
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.600]   thought cannot both be true at the same time.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:00.620]   To give you an example, both the Chiefs and the Rams cannot both be the best team in the
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.040]   NFL.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.800]   Either it's the Chiefs, it's the Rams, or neither.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:16.400]   But the one thing it cannot be is that both cannot be the best, since the best implies
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.040]   that there is no other.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.260]   I cannot say both the Dodgers and the Rays won the World Series.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.280]   It's either the Dodgers, or the Rays, or neither.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.640]   This case was the Dodgers.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.880]   Truth is fixed because by nature whatever is true does not change.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.240]   Truth is fixed because by nature whatever is true does not change.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.080]   The square root of 9 is 3.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.660]   It's always been 3, it continues to be that, and will forever be so.
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.900]   The square root of 9 will never be anything other than 3.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.040]   It will never be 3.00001.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.080]   It will never be 2.99999.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.600]   The square root of 9 is 3, and will always be 3.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.200]   Truth also corresponds to reality.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.880]   For example, gravity exists.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.760]   You might hate gravity.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.040]   I might hate gravity.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.000]   You might want to fly.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.400]   I might want to fly.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.880]   Let's say we both go up to the 8th story of a building, and I am so convinced of quote
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.600]   unquote my truth.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.320]   I'm so convinced of it.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:48.100]   I'm so convinced of it, and I want to fly so bad, and I hate gravity so much, I decide
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.840]   to jump off the 8th story.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:09:00.160]   Now in that case, only one person's truth is going to correspond to reality.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:07.200]   And my truth, that gravity doesn't exist, will not correspond to reality because it
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.720]   is not true.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.300]   Truth withstands the test of scrutiny.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:22.000]   Truth withstands the test of scrutiny by extension of it being exclusive, fixed, and corresponding
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   to reality.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.760]   Truth can be inspected, it can be explored, it can be vetted, it can be interrogated,
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.200]   it can be dissected, it can be audited over and over and over again with a fine tooth
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.920]   comb and at the end of it, guess what?
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:51.680]   Truth will remain truth despite whatever truth-seeking process you put it through.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.640]   It doesn't matter what kind of truth-seeking process you put it through.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.840]   Truth remains truth.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:06.920]   Truth does not need to hide and has nothing to hide.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:13.640]   If you are seeking the truth of a matter, consider these characteristics.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:20.040]   Nobody has said to be arrogant, to be smug, to be pompous.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:29.800]   And also, don't give into the dialectic that if you do hold to truth, having these characteristics,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.360]   that by virtue of that, you are automatically arrogant, smug, or pompous.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:43.080]   Some people might accuse you of being narrow-minded for believing that truth is exclusive when
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.200]   that's an inherent quality of truth.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.760]   Do not give into such anti-intellectualism.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.880]   That would be the equivalent of being called arrogant because you state that the sun is
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.280]   hot.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.040]   The sun is by nature hot.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   That is a fact.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.840]   Believing in an inherent quality of truth does not equate with arrogance.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.860]   To drive this point home even further, consider the following.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:21.120]   If someone says "all truth is subjective", that statement itself is self-defeating since
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:28.760]   that statement has to be objective in order for it to be true.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:36.040]   The "all truth is subjective" statement must borrow capital from the objective worldview
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.480]   in order for it to be true.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   But if someone borrows that capital, they have just disproved what they were trying
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.040]   to prove, namely that all truth is subjective.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:57.960]   But if that statement needs to be objective, what have you just done?
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.480]   It is inescapable, isn't it?
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.600]   So now, let me ask you then.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.160]   Why is this important?
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.640]   Why should anyone bother?
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.080]   Does truth matter?
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.400]   My answer is a resounding yes.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.340]   Truth absolutely matters.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.280]   Doesn't truth matter to someone who is accused of committing a crime?
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.740]   What if that were you or a loved one accused of committing a crime?
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.240]   Would you not think truth mattered?
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.220]   Doesn't truth matter if you're flying across country in an airplane?
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:38.080]   Aren't you hoping that the engineer who built the airplane used truthful mathematical propositions
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.920]   as opposed to faulty ones?
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:46.880]   I'm sure truth would matter to you if you were 40,000 feet in the air.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.840]   I'm sure if you were 40,000 feet in the air, you're hoping that the engineer who built
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:05.920]   the plane built it on the truthful proposition that the square root of 9 is 3 and not 3.0000001
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.480]   or 2.99999999.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.240]   Precision would be of high importance in that case, wouldn't it?
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:23.320]   Exclusivity, which is an inherent quality of truth, matters a lot, doesn't it?
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.720]   Doesn't truth matter if you're in the hospital and the doctor is telling the nurse how much
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.040]   medicine to give you or a loved one via an IV?
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:40.200]   Truth matters in every academic subject of study, in every area of life, and all aspects
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.560]   of personal matters.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.840]   All of life corresponds to truth.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.280]   What you think is good and evil, virtue or vice, whether you're religious or not, matters
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.720]   immensely.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:58.880]   The lack of any truth convictions about abstract principles of life matters immensely.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:09.440]   To say the same thing yet another way, theology or lack thereof, is immensely practical.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:19.080]   And let me tell you, none of us like bearing the brunt of a lie.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.540]   Life has consequences for being wrong.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:30.520]   We might not like that, but those consequences will still come.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.960]   And many times, it might not even be you or me bearing those consequences.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.860]   It could easily be those you have the most influence over.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.660]   And for most of us, that's our friends and family.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:50.160]   I want to go even deeper by demystifying why we should care.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.920]   I want to stay on this topic.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:15:00.720]   There are dialectics that the culture pushes on us that aren't the correct dialectics for
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.480]   investigative inquiry.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:11.120]   Just so we're all on the same page, a dialectic simply means discussion and reasoning by dialogue
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.320]   as a method of intellectual investigation.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:21.360]   A dialectic means discussion and reasoning by dialogue as a method of intellectual investigation.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.800]   This is typically done through setting up opposing viewpoints and trying to resolve
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.400]   a conflict between the two.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.520]   Let me give you some examples of what our culture deems to be dialectics.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.040]   The sports analogy that I used just now, the daughters in the race, that would be a dialectic
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.520]   because those were the two baseball teams in the World Series.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.280]   The Lakers and the Celtics would be another dialectic because these two teams went at
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.200]   it in the Magic Johnson era and the Kobe Bryant era.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:00.440]   Some political ones could be conservative vs. liberal, democrat vs. republican, marxism,
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.380]   socialism, communism vs. free market capitalism.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:13.200]   My point is that a lot of times we automatically assume these dialectics because the culture
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:20.540]   pushes them on us and not necessarily because they are the correct dialectics we should
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.760]   be thinking about.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.160]   This is where it becomes dangerous.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:32.560]   Let's say I want to talk about the dangers within the democratic party or the dangers
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.280]   within the republican party.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:41.920]   A huge swath of people will automatically assume that the person speaking is either
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.040]   a loyal democrat or a loyal republican.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:53.640]   And for many, they cannot extricate themselves from a culture-induced dialectic and so when
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:17:00.040]   we see this dialectical image, we don't see any other configuration of these opposing
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:07.400]   viewpoints so we automatically assume, well, this conversation has no value because it's
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.280]   merely political.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:18.240]   And therefore, any discussion into this has no real spiritual, philosophical, or theological
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.840]   value.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:29.280]   What many people fail to understand is that for many people, it is precisely on theological
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:35.520]   grounds that informs our political leanings and not vice versa.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:43.520]   However, the vast majority of people will villainize others who do wish to engage in
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:49.280]   the conversation precisely because it has immense theological importance.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:58.960]   But the thing is, it is much easier to deal with straw men, it is much easier to caricature
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:06.560]   another's position as opposed to thinking honestly, thinking critically.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:13.640]   Many just want to remain willfully ignorant because in your willful ignorance, you could
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:24.000]   feel morally superior and our culture has equated outrage as a moral virtue.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:36.080]   And so, for that reason, a lot of people engage in feeling outraged because they like the
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.520]   perspective that they think they are getting from others.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:48.880]   And that is a cultural phenomenon, not an inherently good one.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:57.320]   But an inquiry into truth requires that we question even whether or not our starting
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:03.000]   positional dialectic is even true.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Another absolutely incorrect dialectic we heard about recently is abortion versus arrogance.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.720]   That was an absolutely incorrect dialectic.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:26.240]   Another reason you should care is because imbibing worldviews that are incompatible
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:33.640]   with truth are much more harmful than you might be cognizant of.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:40.720]   Incompatible worldviews act to corrupt your mind and steer you away from the truth unknowingly.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:46.080]   They douse the desires of your heart that are inherently good.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.720]   They blind you from interpreting reality correctly.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.040]   Truth matters because love rejoices with the truth.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.600]   That is 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.160]   If you want to be loving to your neighbor no matter who they are or what they believe,
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.440]   you tell the truth.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:15.840]   Isn't it unloving to tell a cancer patient they have cancer because you are fearful of
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.400]   what they might say about you?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:28.480]   It is usually a series of missteps that are rampant in our lives that leave us vulnerable,
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:34.960]   indefensible and ultimately impotent for any good work.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:41.400]   Lies, even the ones you think do not matter or have any tangible connection to anything
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:50.440]   significant, do have the potential to pave the path to hell and that path is lighted
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.160]   with good intentions.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.000]   Ephesians 2.2 tells us that Satan is the prince of the power of the air.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.480]   Or in other words, he is the prince of this world.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.200]   1 John 5.19 states that the whole world lies in wickedness.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.920]   Ephesians 6.12 states that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.840]   rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.920]   forces of wickedness.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.520]   All these verses point not only to the prominent power that Satan has, but it also points to
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.760]   how deceptive he is.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.200]   And let me tell you, being deceptive many times is power.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.600]   Don't get me wrong, we should fear God and not have this paralyzing fear of Satan.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:46.520]   But there is a difference between having a paralyzing fear and being sober and understanding
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.080]   who Satan is.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.720]   Truth also helps you to understand the times.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   And understanding the times is always crucial.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.360]   During the transition from Saul to David in 1 Chronicles 12, it tells us of noteworthy
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.560]   men who had their hearts turned toward King David.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.560]   It talks about the mighty men of valor.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:18.320]   Of relevance here, in 1 Chronicles 12.32 it states, "From the sons of Issachar, men who
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should do, their chiefs were two hundred,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.740]   and all their kinsmen were at their command."
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:39.600]   From the sons of Issachar, men who understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.280]   do.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.500]   We need people who understand the times.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.320]   We need people with knowledge of what we should do.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:59.760]   And so, if somewhere in your heart you're still unmoved by what I just said, consider
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.880]   for a moment that perhaps there is something crooked in your heart.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:13.320]   I want to read to you John 18, 28-38, it reads like this, "Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.800]   into the praetorium, and it was early.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.320]   And they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, so that they would not be defiled,
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.240]   but might eat the Passover.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.720]   Therefore Pilate went out to them and said, 'What accusation do you bring against this
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   man?'
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.520]   They answered and said to him, 'If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520]   him to you.'
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.280]   So Pilate said to them, 'Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.'
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.480]   The Jews said to him, 'We are not permitted to put anyone to death to fulfill the word
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.280]   of Jesus which he spoke, signifying but what kind of death he was about to die.'
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.040]   Therefore Pilate entered again into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him, 'Are
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.480]   you the king of the Jews?'
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.440]   Jesus answered, 'Are you saying this on your own initiative, or did others tell you
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.000]   about me?'
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.520]   Pilate answered, 'I am not a Jew, am I?
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.600]   Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.840]   What have you done?'
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.640]   Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:16.280]   If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would be fighting so that I would
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.240]   not be handed over to the Jews.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.920]   But as it is, my kingdom is not of this realm.'
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.240]   Therefore Pilate said to him, 'So you are a king?'
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.320]   Jesus answered, 'You say correctly that I am a king.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.400]   For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.280]   truth.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.920]   Anyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:49.320]   Pilate said to him, 'What is truth?'
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.280]   We know what happens after this.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:59.880]   Pilate will find no fault in him, but the crowd demanding Barabbas over Jesus will cause
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:05.760]   Pilate to hand over Barabbas as opposed to Jesus despite Pilate's own admission that
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.400]   he had found no fault in Jesus.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.920]   Pilate sought to find a balance in all of this.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:20.240]   In Matthew 27, as the crowds become more belligerent and demand that Jesus be crucified, he believes
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.360]   that by washing his hands and placing the blame on the crowds, that he is freed from
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.360]   the responsibility of his actions.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.240]   Matthew 27, 24, when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.800]   was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, 'I am
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.180]   innocent of this man's blood.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.280]   See to that yourselves.'
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.920]   But guess what?
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:49.840]   Pilate doesn't get to make his own rules.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.960]   And just like we learned about truth, the fact that Pilate states that he is innocent
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.480]   doesn't actually mean he is innocent.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:06.320]   Just because he said, 'I'm washing my hands,' doesn't necessarily mean his hands are clean.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:16.480]   And with that, he orders Jesus to be crucified, the very embodiment of truth.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:30.120]   After this, the very embodiment of truth is speaking truth to Pilate and Pilate's response
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:38.080]   is 'What is truth?'
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:44.760]   Are you someone who believes truth matters?
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:51.960]   Or are you more like Pilate, who says, 'What is truth?' and then just orders it to be crucified?
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:27:00.160]   I want to read to you some more passages to solidify this point.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:06.840]   Psalm 119, 160, "The sum of your word is truth, and every one of your righteous rules endures
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.840]   forever."
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.000]   John 1, 14, "And the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.080]   Glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.900]   John 4, 24, "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.480]   John 8, 32, "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.840]   John 14, 6, "And Jesus said to him, 'I am the way and the truth, and the life.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.740]   No one comes to the Father except through me.'"
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:41.960]   John 16, 13, "When the spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.760]   he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears, he will speak, and he will
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.960]   declare to you the things that are to come."
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.680]   John 17, 17, "Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   Your word is truth."
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:28:00.160]   2 Timothy 2, 15, "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:08.360]   who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth."
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:20.120]   If you feel the need to abandon truthful propositions to achieve some other perceived noble end,
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:26.880]   you are probably not being used to promote good, but rather evil.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:33.300]   Because something sinister is afoot, and you cannot see it.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.360]   Integrity is greater than pragmatism.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.160]   Be convinced that truth matters.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.440]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.120]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:58.440]   To him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.040]   James Hong out.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.620]   (upbeat music)
