[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.160]   - We are coming off of our national conference,
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.740]   which was dedicated to the life and legacy of C.S. Lewis,
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.860]   who died 50 years ago this fall.
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.480]   It was a great time, with a lot of helpful messages shared,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.420]   and all of those messages are now online
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.180]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.700]   And one of the big themes of the conference
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.400]   centered on the imagination,
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.900]   and how faith and theology
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.800]   require the use of our imaginations.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.280]   Pastor John, do you have any takeaways from the conference,
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.320]   or things you're thinking about post-conference,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.200]   on the imagination?
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   - Yeah, a lot was said in the conference on Lewis
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.760]   about the imagination.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.920]   What is it?
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.820]   And so on.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.880]   One feature, it seems to me, of imagination,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.400]   is the ability to see the value,
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.400]   or the wonder, or the glory of things for what they are.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.160]   In other words, just see ordinary things
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.280]   for the wonder that they are.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.040]   Which means that, in a sense,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.320]   maybe that shouldn't be called imagination.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.760]   We usually think of imagination
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.440]   as thinking of ways of describing things
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.720]   that are different from what they are.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.560]   And that's true.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.720]   In fact, I made a case for that.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.760]   But because of the fall, Clyde Kilby,
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.640]   my teacher of literature in college,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.840]   he said one of the saddest effects of the fall
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.160]   is that we get tired of things.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000]   So we go to the Alps, see 'em for the first time,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.800]   we're stunned, speechless.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.340]   We rent a little chalet at the foot of the Alps,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.780]   and for three mornings we get up amazed,
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.240]   and the fourth morning we're watching television.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.640]   And he says that's an effect of the fall
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.680]   that will be taken away.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.640]   Won't that be wonderful?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.840]   In the age to come where we never get tired of anything.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.600]   Which means that now we need powers of imagination,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.120]   not just to think of things that are not,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.160]   but to look at the things that are
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.960]   and see them for what they are.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.880]   There's the fresh thought that I had.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.840]   Just looking at what is there
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.280]   and being amazed at what it is,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.240]   not just thinking of things it's like that it's not.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.820]   And this is what Lewis was so good at.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.820]   He was described as having an omnivorous attentiveness,
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.740]   a phrase that I love so much.
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.140]   He was awake to the wonder of things.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.780]   He saw more in ordinary things than I do,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.060]   and therefore when I listen to him or read him,
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.380]   I see more things.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.380]   He lived with a kind of sensuous expectancy.
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.700]   I just thought of that phrase yesterday.
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.860]   That is, his senses, by sensuous I don't mean sensual,
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.940]   I mean sensuous, having to do with the senses.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.140]   His senses were expectant.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.660]   Like if he saw a tree, he would see something fresh and new.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.600]   If he saw a little slug inching its way along the sidewalk,
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.100]   leaving a silver trail, he'd see something new.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.240]   He would have thought that,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.940]   I think Lewis would have thought that boredom
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.180]   with the world is a sin.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.340]   It insults the glory of creation.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.500]   So here's one example,
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.620]   and this is what made all this stuff pop
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.880]   in the last few hours.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.340]   One great example is that Lewis stood in God-exalting awe
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.780]   of what it means to be human,
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.220]   just what it means to be human.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.940]   And he helped me in many ways here
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.420]   rise above my petty complaints.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.540]   I tend to see a lot of people as frustrating and annoying,
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.980]   and that's just so lame.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.020]   I mean, Lewis saw people as stunning.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.740]   And here's the quote that blew me away
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.620]   and continues to blow me away.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.300]   He said, "It is a serious thing to live in a society
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.580]   "of possible gods and goddesses,
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.160]   "to remember that the dullest
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.200]   "and most uninteresting person you talk to
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.100]   "may one day be a creature,
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.860]   "which if you saw it now,
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.460]   "you would be strongly tempted to worship,
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.260]   "or else a horror and a corruption
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.180]   "such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.980]   "All day long, we are in some degree helping each other
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.320]   "to one of those two destinations.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.540]   "There are no ordinary people.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.900]   "You have never talked to a mere mortal.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.900]   "Nations, cultures, arts, civilization, these are mortal,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.440]   "and their life is to ours like the life of a gnat.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.500]   "But it is immortals with whom we joke, work,
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.980]   "marry, snub, exploit, immortal horrors
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.860]   "or everlasting splendors."
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.760]   End of quote.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.740]   Now, that's just stunning.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.060]   Who else sees things like that?
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.300]   Who in the world says nations, cultures,
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.660]   and arts, and civilizations,
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.660]   these are like a gnat to a human being?
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.180]   I just think that's incredible.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.520]   I mean, when you read it, you say,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.200]   "Well, yes, that's true, they do.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.660]   "They come and go, and human beings never go.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.920]   "They live forever."
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.880]   And so he compares the two and say,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.360]   "So which are you gonna be amazed at?
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.480]   "Political powers, and cultures, and arts,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.800]   "and civilizations, or your neighbor?"
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.560]   I mean, that kind of thing is so revolutionary to your soul
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.240]   when you read it and you start looking at your wife,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.040]   and your kids, and your neighbors,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.700]   and everybody so differently.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.920]   So the effect this has had on me
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.040]   is to make me pretty serious about life and people.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.240]   And when I say serious, I don't mean unhappy.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.400]   "Joy is the serious business of heaven," Lewis said.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.600]   The opposite of serious, serious is not sad.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.560]   The opposite of serious is silly,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.200]   and frivolous, and flippant, and trivial.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.680]   Lewis said, "We must play, but our merriment
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.500]   "must be of that kind," and it is, in fact,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.120]   the merriest kind, he said, "which exists between people
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.880]   "who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously."
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.080]   No flippancy, no superiority, no presumption.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.780]   So I came away from the conference, Tony,
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.700]   with things like that, more amazed that I'm alive,
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.100]   more amazed that I'm a human being in God's image,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.280]   more amazed that I'm a sinner saved by grace,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.780]   that I'm destined for eternal joys,
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.480]   and many of which I have tasted,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.160]   and some scarcely tasted at all.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.480]   - Yes, that is amazing.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
