[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.060]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua, and today
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.320]   we tackle one of those seemingly mundane topics that I think makes a big difference in our
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.080]   daily lives. And it's simply this. How do you track when you're out shopping? How do
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.580]   you track the cost of the merchandise that you're accumulating in your shopping cart,
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.720]   or shopping basket, or shopping bag, as the case may be? This is one area where online
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.280]   shopping just beats the pants off of in-person shopping. Because in online shopping, as you
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:26.040]   click "add to cart" on your online grocery store, you can see that total add up. And
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.360]   then when you're done, you can open that cart up and you can delete, you can save for
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.620]   later, you can adjust the quantities, and that makes it really easy to stick within
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.600]   your budget. After all, if you have $367 in your checking account and you're shopping
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.840]   in that online cart and you see that your tax and shipping is going to bring you to
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.520]   $374, then of course you have to change and reduce the quantities. But this is a little
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.860]   bit harder in person. Because in person it's hard to keep track of all the different things
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.920]   that you are adding into your cart. Now depending on where you're shopping, this may or may
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.800]   not change your, it may be easier in some circumstances than it is in others. I find
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.000]   it really tough to keep track of things when I'm shopping in two particular places. A
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.760]   store where I'm accumulating lots of items, or a store where I'm accumulating items
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.520]   of hugely varying values. So the grocery store is the biggest challenge for me, where you're
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.880]   kind of putting usually dozens and dozens of items in a cart. And it's just hard to
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.000]   keep track of it. Is it going to be a $282 shopping cart, or is it going to be a $350
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.660]   shopping cart? That makes a big difference. Especially if you are seeking to stick to
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.600]   a certain amount of money in your budget. One recommendation that I often give, and
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.440]   that I personally practice, is I never spend digital money when I can spend cash. Which
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.760]   means I usually have an amount of, I always have an amount of money in my wallet, and
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.320]   I want to make sure that I don't wind up at the front register embarrassing myself
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.800]   by not having enough money in my wallet, and then feeling the pressure of all the people
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.520]   behind me trying to figure out what to do. What do I put back? How do I adjust if I don't
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.840]   have enough money? Or I wind up overspending, which is unfortunate. So I think this perhaps
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.000]   is one of those areas where, with the proliferation of digital spending, where most people swipe
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.680]   a credit card or a debit card when checking out, I think they worry less about it. But
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.960]   my observation is they shouldn't worry less about it. You really shouldn't. Because,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.240]   yes, you might have the money in your checking account, but that's how you wind up overspending.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.600]   So I want to give you a couple of very simple suggestions to put in practice that will help
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.040]   you to make sure that you keep track of your expenditures as you add them up, so that you
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.580]   can take a moment and think before you're actually at the checkout register, and consider
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.280]   if you've chosen the right things for you. And those suggestions are, one, very tactile,
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   and two, is going to be an app. So first, if you don't want to spend any money, and
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.920]   you just want to have a very simple foolproof system, what I recommend to you is, while
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.280]   you're shopping, just carry a small index card, a small piece of paper, doesn't matter,
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.240]   a back of an envelope from your junk mail, and write down a running total of the cart.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.840]   I'm pretty good at mental math, better than, I would guess, the majority of people at mental
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.160]   math. But it's tough to keep math straight in your head when you have a big basket full
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.280]   of stuff. And so I find that I need to write it down. So often when I'm out shopping, I'll
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.560]   carry just a very simple sheet of paper, and just write down a simple round number price
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.400]   of everything that I'm putting into a cart. Most of the time, just the number is sufficient.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.360]   So let's say that you're out shopping, and you're getting eggs, and they're three bucks,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.240]   you write down three bucks, and then you're getting a carton of milk, and that's $3.50,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.920]   I decided to write down four bucks. And I just always round up to the next dollar for
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.480]   a nice round number, and then I keep a running total. So three plus four is seven, and I
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.880]   just write down the price and keep a running total there. That works very well, it's very
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   simple and very quick, and it really helps to get a good understanding of what's in your
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.380]   shopping basket. Of course, you can do this at any store, but it's most helpful at stores
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.600]   where you have a lot of things, where you can't remember the particular prices. It's
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.680]   easy if you have three items, you know one was 30 bucks, one was 40, and one was 50,
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.000]   that's easy to do. But when you have 100 items, that's a little bit harder. So I will just
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.200]   simply often carry a sheet of paper and a pencil, and just do some quick, very round
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.940]   number math problems to keep that running total. Then when I can see it's getting close
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.280]   to my budget, $100, $200, whatever my budget is, then I can make decisions. The other solution
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.760]   was recommended to me some months ago by a listener, and I have found this to be a phenomenal
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:57.520]   solution, and it's an app. The app is called Solver, S-O-U-L-V-E-R, but it is one of the
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.000]   most useful apps that I have found, especially related to money and related to finance. I
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.360]   think most financial apps are wildly oversold with regard to their actual value, but this
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.000]   app is very useful. I'll describe it to you verbally, and then you can check it out for
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.200]   yourself and describe to you how I use it. Verbally speaking, it's a spreadsheet app
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.920]   that collects and collates the data that you enter into the sheet in a very less structured
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.880]   way. So there are no columns, it just has a couple of very simple functions, and you
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.000]   can enter text or you can enter numerals. And then the app will discard the text, but
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.080]   it will use the numerals. And in the text, it actually puts into it, it can do some simple
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.160]   mathematical functions as you're entering the data in. So I've come to the point where
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.280]   I use this on most shopping trips. And if you, I recommend you try it out. I've not
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.480]   reached out to the, I have no connection with the app maker, you just have to buy it in
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.400]   the store, it's a couple bucks, something like that. Again, it's called Solver, S-O-U-L-V-E-R,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.760]   look it up in your app store. But I'll tell you how I use it and how it's so useful. I
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.880]   use it when I'm out shopping. And so I have here on my screen in front of me, I have the
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.240]   total from a recent shopping trip that I did at Costco. And as I was out shopping, I was
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:30.200]   putting in the name of an item and the price. And so my first line here was I bought a carton
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:37.280]   of coffee and $7.99. So I just entered 7.99 coffee. And then I bought some bear spray
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.800]   and so my next one is 39.99 bear spray. And then over in the right hand column, I have
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.520]   the right hand column set to give me a running total. And as I'm actually putting in the
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.360]   data, it will accumulate that running total. But the beautiful thing about it is it's also
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:08:01.920]   extremely easy to put in multiple quantities. So one of my categories here is chips. I bought
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.080]   some tortilla chips. So those were $4.59, but I bought two bags. So I just wrote chips
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:14.180]   4.59 times two, and it automatically over in the right hand column, it automatically
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:20.880]   created the total for me of $9.18 and added that to my total. And so a Costco trip for
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.240]   me is a good place where this is so useful because I have very small purchases on here,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.160]   a pineapple for $2.99. And I have very large purchases on here. In my case, I bought a
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:38.000]   mattress for $199.99 and I bought dog food. And so I can look at that and I can do all
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.200]   kinds of things with that information. I can know that when I'm getting up to checkout,
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.320]   my total was $477.80. Now that doesn't include tax, but I just mentally round up to tax.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.000]   And so I was able to stay under a $500 checkout based upon having this data here. I recommend
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.600]   this app to you. It is the most useful app I have found for being in a store. And it
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:08.340]   really usefully brings in the value of a phone and it makes this semi-smart spreadsheet really
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.680]   work for you. So give it a shot. You'll have to buy the app to try it. Again, it's called
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.880]   Solver, S-O-U-L-V-E-R. You have to buy it to try it, but in my opinion, it has been
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.720]   well worth the money for, again, whatever it is in the app store, $2 or $3, something
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.480]   like that. Give it a try and give it a try on your next shopping list, because here is
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:36.640]   why this is so important. Personal finance, good personal finance is a cumulation of many,
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:43.120]   many small things. There is almost never one big thing. That's why these topics that I
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.760]   share with you are so diverse, but it's an accumulation of many, many small things. And
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.920]   it's also an accumulation of habits and practices. At the end of the day, you have to control
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.320]   your expenses. There's no way around it. And that control of expenses for most of us begins
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.680]   with some simple things that we learn when we're young. Our parents, hopefully, will
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.960]   teach us how to control our desires and how to plan ahead for our expenses and how to
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.720]   get a good value on our money so we don't waste our money on some stupid cheap thing.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.480]   But then it continues and we learn how to adjust and prioritize our expenses. And there's
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.120]   good daily practice in the grocery store or in the clothing store that will help you to
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.080]   keep track of your money and help you to be moderate with your expenses. And then that
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.960]   simply continues up as your scale grows, as you are engaging in much larger financial
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.880]   transactions. Frugality doesn't become less important. It just happens on a different
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.120]   scale where instead of worrying about saving $1.99 by buying three cartons of coffee when
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.640]   it's on sale, then you're saving tens of thousands of dollars by buying significantly
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.720]   discounted assets when they're on sale. So these practices and habits need to be built
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.620]   steadily and you've got to be in control. And unfortunately, most of us get in a real
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:06.880]   bind when we're facing pressure. I had an unusual experience recently where I made a
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:13.320]   decision, a financial decision, under pressure. And I was checking out somewhere, I made an
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.680]   offer and I went ahead and bought it. And in hindsight, it was a mistake. And I've tried
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.240]   and tried to be very insulated about that, but I still succumb to the pressure. And many
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.440]   of us do, whether it's the pressure at the car dealer, the pressure at the grocery store.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:32.600]   And so one of the most valuable habits you can practice is planning logically, planning
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.320]   ahead, and then making sure that you're not subject to that pressure, that panicked moment.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.760]   And an app like Solver or a simple piece of paper can help you to avoid that when you're
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.320]   at the grocery store, because you can pull aside when you're not in line, you can look
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.640]   at your cart, you can know how much money is going in that total cart, you can know
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.460]   it pretty confidently. And then you can decide before you're facing the pressure if you want
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.560]   to put something back, or if you want to go ahead and check out. So I hope these two suggestions
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.480]   are useful for you. And kudos to the to the developers of Solver for coming up with a
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.000]   really useful app. And thank you to my listener, I don't remember who you are at this point
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:28.720]   who recommended it to me. It has been a very useful in my life.
