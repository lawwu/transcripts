[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.660]   Vanguard Group, and President of the Vanguard's Bogel Center Financial Markets Research Center.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.060]   He created Vanguard in 1974 and served as chairman until 2000.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.660]   He entered the investment field immediately following his graduation from Princeton University,
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.940]   where he graduated magna cum laude with a degree in economics in 1951.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.780]   If I listed all of his honors and achievements, which most of you already know about, we wouldn't
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.540]   have any time left for his presentation.
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.380]   So I'll dispense with this and ask you to please welcome our very special guest of honor,
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.100]   Mr. Jack Bogel.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:19.780]   Welcome, Jack.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:36.140]   Thank you all very much.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.500]   I really appreciate that.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.940]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:02:00.580]   That enthusiastic welcome, I think, is in part—I assume is in part—because I had
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.460]   a little problem yesterday, a little problem resolved yesterday with my heart, which was
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.740]   out of rhythm, and I wasn't sure I could be here at all.
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.540]   So I'm obviously happy to be here, and in my eighty-nine-and-a-half year, happy to be
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.420]   here.
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.560]   Don't knock it.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.240]   It's all I was doing yesterday, and they've done it to me before a number of times, is
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.200]   when your heart gets out of rhythm, shock it back into rhythm.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.260]   And this little machine happened to be designed by one of my first cardiologists, Dr. Bernard
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.460]   Land up in Boston, called the Cardioverter, and it always is a shock, and it's over
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.180]   and you're out during—they give you a little very light anesthetic.
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:09.300]   And so it's back, got back to normal yesterday, and I'm pleased to report that I've already
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.140]   sent it in on my iPhone to my cardiologist this morning, and the first words I saw were
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.900]   "normal," and I've seen so few normals in the last couple of years that I don't
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.300]   quite know what to say about that.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.700]   Well, here we are again.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:37.300]   Here's my wonderful Mike Nolan, who I couldn't get anything done.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.380]   And there's my staunch Emily Snyder.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.260]   And we have a photo of the three of us, and actually with Kathy Junker, our kind of part-time
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:04:04.260]   person, in the new book—I'll get to that later—and it says, "Never so much owned
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260]   was owed by so many to so few."
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.220]   That's a Churchill expression about the Royal Air Force in World War II.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.140]   And so our three of us and Kathy are our little team, and man, do we crank it out.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.140]   It's pretty exciting, and everybody seems to get along well together, does get along
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.660]   well together, and without them my life would not be a hell of a lot of fun, to be quite
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.660]   honest with you.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.100]   When I come in in the morning, they're off and chatting, and they immediately sit down
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.180]   and get back to work.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:45.220]   It's as if someone says, "Here he comes," and we have a good time together, I think,
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.140]   and I know I do.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:54.900]   So here we are again, Boglehead '17, particularly I'd like to welcome Tim Dempsey, who is here
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.320]   for his seventeenth time.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.940]   Are you there, Tim?
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.300]   [Applause.]
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.660]   I told him I thought the cruel and unusual punishment was prohibited by the U.S. Constitution,
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.340]   but apparently not.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.220]   So I've got a presentation, obviously not the same as last year, but similar in a lot
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.220]   of ways.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.340]   It seems to be what you like, and Mike has helped me out, done all the work on the slides,
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.780]   which is a huge job we keep revising and changing.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.820]   So we have a large number of slides, some of which will take only a second.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.820]   And so here we go.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.740]   We're going to start off with some of the bigger news clippings of the year.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.700]   And there's a nice cover story on Barons.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:54.780]   I look a little, hmm, maybe morose or something on the cover, but we quickly look happy when
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.540]   we get inside.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.920]   And it even shows I went to Princeton, by the way, if you look carefully, which is nice.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:10.540]   Another really substantial article called, it was in Advisor Perspective, by Larry Siegel,
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:20.520]   who is the chief financial expert for the Chartered Financial Analyst, CFA, the professional
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.260]   organization.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.260]   And it was nice.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.460]   It was a very substantive interview.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.920]   And I'll come back to this later.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:37.900]   There was only one thing, I didn't bring it up here with me, but I said something very
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:46.420]   controversial to a lot of people, I guess, I'll get to the chart later, but it expressed
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:52.320]   my opinion that I think growth and value, which is the better choice, and I'll talk
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:07:00.820]   about that later, is basically all the good years for value were concentrated at the beginning
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.380]   of a 90-year period.
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.980]   And the recent years, 30 years probably, it's been back and forth, back and forth, back
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.900]   and forth with no difference.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.460]   So what I said in the article, in the interview with Larry, that I assumed that was because
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:23.340]   having seen the past 30 years ago, people decided they would get into value and out
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.100]   of growth, and that bid up the value stocks and down the growth stocks, and so we had
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.700]   no reversion to the mean, this would not be uncommon.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:38.020]   And a person took, there was a lot of response to that in this article.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.620]   In fact, Mike was nice enough to send it to me, I could look at it last night, should
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.980]   have put me to sleep.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:50.980]   Sixty-one pages of comments about that conclusion, 61 pages, and many of them were from Larry
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.660]   Swedrow, who had the first one.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.900]   Larry Swedrow is in the Bogle head, is he?
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.580]   Is he here?
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.780]   Okay, then I'll continue to speak freely.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.860]   His first sentence was, "Jack Bogle is wrong again."
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.580]   And it's easily possible, of course, that he's right.
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:20.220]   But 61 pages of comments, and I'm talking about a little tiny type on the page.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.220]   It's unbelievable.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.180]   I didn't bring it up here because it's too heavy.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.540]   So that was it, but it was overall a nice article.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.220]   And I just throw this one up here, influential financial revolutionary, with no interest
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:44.460]   in crypto, simply because I had this wonderful phrase, "a grandfatherly assassin."
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:50.340]   And I don't know, I've never been called a grandfatherly assassin before in my life
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.440]   and will probably never be called one again.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.940]   And then this next Bloomberg Businessweek by Justin Fox said something that I found
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.900]   very heartwarming, if you will, no pun intended.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.700]   And he says, "I call Bogle because he's the author of the clearest outline of the
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:15.540]   economic role of the asset manager that I've ever read, ever, in his 1951 Princeton senior
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.980]   thesis, 'The Economic Role of the Investment Company.'"
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.500]   I mean, it's nice to see people still reading that.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   It's not all that good.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.460]   It's in one of my books, and it's okay.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:33.180]   But if people want to overstate my abilities and contribution, who am I to stop them?
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:40.100]   And then finally, I guess under the clips, even on vacation, of course, I do a little
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.100]   work.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.460]   And this was at the Lake Placid—or Adirondack, I should say—roundtable.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.700]   And it was a really nice speech.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.780]   I did it in a little bit different style, and it ended in a standing ovation.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:10:00.460]   But I think that's because—at the Full House—I think that's because I ended with
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.860]   a prayer, a Lake Placid prayer that we do in our family.
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.100]   And so in any event, that was a fun thing to do.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.660]   And then another article here in the Enquirer, it keeps saying, "Bogle, Bogle, Bogle, Bopo
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.820]   for Bogle," but it's about the Bogleheads Philadelphia chapter.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.060]   And that photograph there, of course, was taken here last year at the National Chapter,
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.500]   if you will.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.900]   And it's really a nice article and a nice tribute, in fact, to all of you.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:41.700]   And I should say at this point that you mean a lot to me, all of you.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:47.420]   And to have this Full House here, this full gathering, and getting such an enthusiastic
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:53.700]   welcome, is—you can't imagine how it feels, how comforting it is, you know.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:00.780]   I'm getting a little bit old, and so I'm starting to reflect a little bit about my
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.140]   career.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:13.300]   And I've never wanted to do that particularly, because of following Sopocles, and when you're
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:19.900]   in trouble always quote Sopocles, "One must wait until the evening to enjoy the splendor
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.740]   of the day."
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.500]   And I used to say, "My evening is not here yet, so I'm not fooling around with the
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.620]   splendor of the day yet, but I think my evening is here."
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.900]   And I don't much like that, but there it is.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:44.300]   Another—I always like to be a little rabble-razzer, you know, and so the Wall Street Journal had
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:54.980]   an article about the Corporate Social Responsibility Fund not doing as well as the market.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:01.340]   And I got the S&P 500, and so I wrote back a nice short letter.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.340]   They like them short.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:08.260]   I've had to work with the editor, the letters editor, they have a special guy in that job,
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.420]   and just said, "So does everybody else like the S&P 500, essentially."
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:19.220]   So it gives me a chance to plug in the last sentence, "The S&P 500 remains a tough standard
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.100]   for all invective managers to outpace."
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.700]   The Corporate Social Fund was a letter to the editor of Barron's by a professor at
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:36.780]   MIT, and—I'm sorry, a Ph.D. from MIT, professor at Harvard, who I saw an article
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.780]   in Barron's.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.340]   I couldn't let it go.
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.380]   And the article said, "In a speculative bubble, everyone buys because everyone else
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.860]   is buying, and then the bubble bursts and everyone sells," to which I responded, "Really?"
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.160]   The simple self-evident fact is that when, quote, "everyone is buying," someone else
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.740]   is selling.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.420]   Duh.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.940]   Dollar for dollar.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:06.020]   And when everyone is selling, someone else is buying.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.640]   This is the eternal reality of the financial markets.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:17.460]   So the fun thing was that Barron's wrote—put my letter in a special box in there, and put
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:26.780]   his response, and his response was, "First let me say, you are a hero of mine."
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.820]   This guy really has good openers.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.180]   And then he adds, a little icing on the cake, "That isn't something that I have said
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.060]   lightly or ever.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.420]   For thirty-five years, I've put my spare savings in the Vanguard Index Fund and done
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.980]   very well with it."
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.780]   I think he means them, but I would never correct a Harvard professor.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:56.400]   But I was a little bit concerned, and I thought his escape hatch was not such a good one.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   And now to your questions.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.380]   One, you were right, of course, that for every buyer there's a seller.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:06.600]   Doesn't seem to me that's a particularly big concession.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.580]   The language you identified was knowingly loose for journalistic purposes.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.020]   I would never use those words in a more scholarly paper.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:20.420]   Well, you know, I write a lot of scholarly stuff, and you don't have to—you can write
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:26.460]   the English language, you can write the truth in a journalistic purpose or a scholarly purpose.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.900]   I overlap a lot.
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.700]   Then we must talk about a couple of fun awards that I got.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.220]   First is the American Indian College Fund, which I supported for a long time, and they
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:47.480]   claim that I've helped 500 young Indian Native Americans with their college educations.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:54.840]   I don't think it's that many, but when I send them the money, I don't—the total
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.420]   scholarship for an American Indian College is $1,000.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.740]   That's all it is.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.780]   And so the reason there may be to get to 500 may be partial scholarships that I've given.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.900]   I don't know, but that's their number, and that made me very happy.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:16.420]   And they offered me the Bill Apache Award, and Bill Apache meaning "Friend of the People,"
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.300]   their big award at a big party they have.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   I told them I just am not up to doing big galas in New York City.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.060]   And so my daughter accepted the award, and that is her with her glasses looking very
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.540]   charming there, as she is.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:42.360]   And she did a great job, and I actually sent my son with her, and he held up his phone
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.060]   so I could hear the speech.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.060]   She did a really wonderful job.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.820]   I'm very proud of my kids, all six of them.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:57.280]   But what I particularly liked was she cited this quote from Chief Sitting Bull about warriors.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:05.060]   And there's an article in the American Airlines magazine, American Airways, called "The Warrior."
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.260]   I think it's called "The Warrior."
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.200]   And you think of warriors in a certain way.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   We all do.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:16.500]   But for us, the Indians, warriors are not what you think of as—think of as warriors.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.740]   A warrior is not someone who fights because no one has the right to take another life.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.100]   The warrior for us is one who sacrifices himself for the good of others.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.620]   His task is to take care of the elderly, the defenseless, those that cannot provide for
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:37.180]   themselves, and above all, the children, the future of humanity.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:45.100]   And I could not write any better what I have tried to do with my career.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.280]   And then there's a big award, kind of a fun one.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.220]   They offered me this award down in Florida.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.940]   It came with, off the record now, it came with $50,000.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.400]   And they don't usually give you any awards.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.240]   Sometimes I think they charge you for the award.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.420]   But I said, "I can't come in person.
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.440]   It's just too much for me to get to Naples, Florida."
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.780]   And so they said, "How about if we fly you down?"
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.880]   And I said, "Well, that would be fine."
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.700]   So Mike and I get out of the airport, Eve doesn't like it when I travel alone, and
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.540]   I have great—Mike has great company.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:31.340]   And so I get to—we get down and pull into Naples Airport, and you can't land in Naples
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.840]   with a commercial plane.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.680]   Oh, no.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.360]   Commercial planes in Naples?
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:42.620]   And with all the big Ritz-Carltons and all that money, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:49.080]   And there's a limousine to meet us, and we go and give the speech and get the awards.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:55.920]   And I gave them a pretty good—some of you have suggested that I should get the Nobel
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.200]   Prize in economics, and it's not going to happen.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   I don't do that kind of work.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.480]   But two of the three people that gave me the award were Nobel laureates.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:11.700]   And so we had our picture taken together to show that I came close.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:18.240]   What I did when I traced the history of the index fund—this is really important—there's
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:25.600]   so much untruth about the development of the indexing generally.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.640]   Nobody argues that I—I mean, everybody understands and agrees that I started the first index
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   mutual fund.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.640]   That's a given, because that's an easy fact to identify.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:46.320]   As to starting indexing, there's a lot of lore in there which doesn't—seems to say
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.680]   that other people were doing this too.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.000]   So let's say they are, and there were people working on it.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   But I said in my talk there to all these people, "Am I saying that one with a mere A/B degree
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.800]   from Princeton and an MBA from Wharton"—that would be Jan Twardowsky, my assistant—"are
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:12.700]   starting all these—those with PhDs and master's degrees who were groomed at the University
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.600]   of Chicago, Stanford, and Harvard?"
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.360]   Of course not.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Truth told.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.360]   Yes, I am.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:26.720]   But it didn't seem like the right thing to say.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.400]   But the main thing is about—there were a whole lot of roiling going around about indexing
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.920]   when I started the first index fund.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.280]   I didn't happen to know about any of it.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.440]   Not anything.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.480]   I didn't know about the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.040]   I didn't know about these guys that won the Nobel Laureate.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.800]   I guess that would be French and Fama or Fama.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.340]   And when I found out about them, I didn't think they were right.
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.880]   But in all our fussing around indexing, this is the important thing, because they all brought
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.720]   out something, maybe seven or eight different enterprises.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.080]   Not one of those fledgling efforts in indexing bore fruit.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.960]   Not one of those early pilot lights ignited the flame of indexing.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.680]   That's a pretty good sentence.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:17.240]   All of those tentative forays failed to create a single index fund that was sustainable and
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:24.760]   successful, all except one, Vanguard Index Investment Trust, First Index Investment Trust.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:32.640]   So whatever the case, I find myself defending my heritage, for want of a better word, of
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.480]   the index fund, and I've had a good chance to make that clear.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.880]   We're going to books for a second now.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.680]   Number 12 has come out.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.880]   I'm heading for a million copies, as you'll see at the top, 949,000 copies.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.880]   It's just amazing how well these books sell, and sometimes for odd reasons.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:21:01.200]   I think when you look at Common Sense on Mutual Funds, 10th Anniversary, 59,000 books, it's
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:09.040]   sold almost as many copies as its original, which was 1999, which sold 67,000 copies.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.440]   But I think the reason the second edition did so well is the publisher, not I, but the
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.240]   publisher, asked David Swensen to write the forward, and David Swensen is a word that
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:26.320]   elates investors, excites investors, impresses investors, and he turned out to be a wonderful
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:39.480]   friend of mine and actually sent me, in I guess respect, Yale gave him 30 bottles of
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:47.480]   expensive wine, Chateau, I think it was called, Chateau $5,000.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.600]   I don't want to tell you the price, but they put it right on the label.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:22:00.040]   He sent me one, and that was about as thoughtful of a gesture as you can imagine.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:08.360]   And when actually I sent him, he wrote me a note saying he'd love to have a copy,
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.440]   some copies for the new edition, the 1999 edition, when I changed the cover.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   It was an ugly cover, and I changed it into a beautiful one.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.520]   I think that's fair.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.000]   I do like what I've done myself the best, and he said, "I'd love to have a copy
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.240]   for every member of my staff, so if I send them down to you, would you sign them?"
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.760]   I wasn't born yesterday.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:42.120]   I waited two days, and then I said, dropped an email, "David, we'll catch you off
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.280]   a store, they're right there, all signed," because I just signed them and sent them up
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.600]   FedEx and waited two days to respond to his email.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.240]   So he was duly impressed, and I think should have been.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.660]   You know, I love to do those things.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.480]   Little things mean so much in this life.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   I'm a little off subject here, but I get letters from investors, letter from crew members,
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:14.040]   people that are in deep trouble, someone that I worked with in Wellington Management Company
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:20.240]   thirty years ago is dying, and his daughter thought it would be nice if I would just send
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   him a little letter.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.360]   Of course I did.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.440]   I mean, what kind of person would not do that?
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.020]   It doesn't matter how busy you are.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.800]   Make the damn time.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:39.400]   And that's my philosophy, no matter how little.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.080]   And we'll talk about Stay the Course, the story of Vanguard and the Index Revolution
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   later on.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.280]   That'll be my closing section today.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:57.280]   And here we are, there are other people writing good things about books and bogleheads.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:06.320]   And so I'd like to congratulate Taylor on his new Bogleheads book, which is doing very
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.320]   well.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   I will say the Bogleheads seem to love it.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.280]   You know, you read the responses on Amazon, and they're just so enthusiastic.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.160]   I didn't have a chance to look and see how well it's doing at the box office, but it's
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   fine.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.160]   It's a good book, and it was my honor to write the forwards.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.680]   So let's talk a little bit about speeches.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:33.640]   One of the more interesting ones came shortly after Bogleheads '16, and if you can look
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:41.120]   down at the bottom of that big black thing, you'll see two things of note, a major address
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:48.620]   by John C. Bogle and a special introduction by Chairman Jay Clayton of the SEC.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:54.040]   As to the major, I didn't know what I was going to write about until I got the program.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.880]   And you know, I wasn't born yesterday.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.520]   I thought, "I guess I'd better give him a major speech.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.920]   I mean, isn't that what you would do?"
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:10.880]   And so I did, and it was actually good, and later printed in essay form in the Financial
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.340]   Analyst Journal.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:18.600]   But even more interesting was special introduction, and I said to the people running the public
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.480]   company accounting board, accounting oversight board, "Had you ever talked Jay Clayton
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.680]   into coming over to talk?"
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.540]   He said, "We didn't talk him into it.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:33.160]   He called us up when he heard you were speaking here and said he would like to do the introduction."
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.220]   And I'm thinking, "Huh?
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.480]   Or was it duh?"
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:45.080]   And he gave this lovely speech, short, sweet, and I'll just read you one paragraph, which
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.080]   I think I can do.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:54.680]   I guess I'd better get my binoculars on for this.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:00.200]   You want to put the second page up, Mike?
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:09.560]   He had three different ideas he wanted to talk about, one personal, one intellectual,
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:15.520]   and one professional, and I'll just read you the intellectual one.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:23.120]   "I love markets and the study of markets, and both amazing things.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:36.600]   They do, and the failures, in an imperfect way, imperfectly.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:43.240]   Mr. Bogle is a student of markets, and the best kind of student, who can see the changes
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:48.800]   before they arrive and plan for them to make markets better.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:56.360]   John is to make life better for the long-term individual retail investor.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.040]   Mr. Bogle's every effort reflects that goal."
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.440]   Well, I must say, I was basking in it.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.600]   I was sitting up there listening to it, and I just, I mean, I think it must be something
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.120]   almost without precedent, and he was a very nice guy, by the way.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.920]   So that speech was the modern corporation of the public interest, and there's the essay
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   that it was turned into.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   I often try and do that, if the speech is any good, and this one goes way back at the
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.280]   beginning and goes back, actually, in my Princeton thesis, or my Princeton studies of the role
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.920]   of investors in corporate governance, and so I was pretty happy with that.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.280]   That was my third-in-three-years lead article in the Financial Analyst Journal.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:43.600]   The previous year, second quarter of '17, was a really good one, I think, balancing
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:50.560]   professional values and business values, and they asked me to do a piece on disorder, and
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:57.520]   I wasn't sure how to do it, so I went back, and that was, to me, quite a compliment, and
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:03.720]   I went back and looked at some of the things I'd written before, and it's, I was stimulated,
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.240]   greatly stimulated, by the fact that I'd given a speech called Mutual Funds, Business
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.320]   or Profession, and when I saw that, I knew immediately what a jackass I was, because
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.120]   everything is both business and profession, everything.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:24.640]   Might be a little teeny-weeny business and a big profession, or a big little profession
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:32.200]   and a big business, but it has to be balanced, and that was the theme I used there, and so
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:39.160]   I was happy with that, and the year before that, I had a piece in the January, February
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:51.520]   of '16, again the lead article, about indexing, and I can't believe this article was that
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.360]   big a success, but I said, when I was talking to them about the following article, they
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:02.160]   don't tell me any of this in advance, I can't believe this was going to be the case, but
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.000]   I said to them, "You know, I understand this was the most popular article, most widely
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.440]   read article in the Financial Analyst Journal in '16," and they said, "No, no, that's
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.440]   not true.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:20.240]   It's the most widely read article in the history of the Financial Analyst Journal."
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.920]   I couldn't believe that, but that, you know, I like a good compliment every once in a while,
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:32.880]   and that's a good one, so then I'm still doing a little speaking, I'm cutting back
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:41.760]   actually a good bit, and so I'll be going to London in October, right after I get back
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:48.320]   from Mumbai, and then speaking to the Philadelphia Analysts at the Philadelphia Country Club.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.080]   No, I just lied to you.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:59.560]   I will be doing a video to accept the Financial News Asset Management Award for Lifetime Achievement
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:05.080]   in London, be doing video, and I'll be doing video for the Morningstar Investment Conference
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:10.080]   in Mumbai, and God willing, I'll be able to do both videos at the same time, because
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.960]   it'd be very effective to do.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.560]   So let's talk a little bit about business now.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:22.960]   Let's talk first about, we've done this before, and these are updates, the index revolution,
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:39.720]   and you'll see a chart, those of you who've been here in previous years have seen it,
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:47.200]   and those lines get closer and closer to the semi-log scale, and I think one would expect
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:53.420]   them to cross, probably in 2021, something like that, and indexing will then be the real
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:57.680]   driver of the mutual fund industry.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:08.840]   It's gone from 10 million, that's 10 million over at the left, to 5.8 trillion, a growth
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:14.520]   rate of 36% a year, and rather uncommonly high, while active management has grown, thanks
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.840]   to the market, at 13%.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.520]   Indexing share mutual fund assets, shown on this chart, you see in stock fund assets,
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.880]   it's already up to 44%.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:31.800]   Just think about that when we talk about the index revolution, and that's the end of my
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:39.060]   subtitle for State of the Course, my new book, The Story of Vanguard and the Index Revolution.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:44.840]   So it is a revolution, and those lines I think are going to keep rising and rising and rising.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.420]   There are a lot of things that don't keep rising, they get interrupted, but I believe
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.660]   that these things will keep growing, and indexing will become more and more important, and make
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:32:01.760]   more and more of a mark on the industry, and do a better, better job for fund investors.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:08.360]   Indexing, however, has taken two courses now, traditional index funds, an acronym which
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:14.320]   I have had absolutely no one else using, but I will continue to use it until hell freezes
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:22.080]   over, thank you, and traditional index funds and exchange traded funds, and you can see
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:27.000]   what a tiny beginning it was, even as recently as '90, and don't forget we started the first
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:35.240]   index fund in 1975, so 15 years of patience, and for the want of a better phrase, staying
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.720]   the course, and finally it begins to take off in the '90s, and starts to grow and grow
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   and grow.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:47.860]   Traditional index funds, that's the blue section of the chart, and right now ETFs have grown
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:52.840]   even faster, exchange traded funds, they are quite different, I think I have a chart on
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:58.640]   this later, but there are intelligent ways of using ETFs and non-intelligent ways of
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:04.280]   using ETFs, and for that matter, intelligent and non-intelligent ways of using traditional
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:11.360]   index funds, but the big non-intelligent ways are concentrated in the ETF area.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:17.320]   You open the Wall Street Journal, and we have the most exciting news for investors, someone
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   somewhere has created a vegan ETF.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:31.720]   You can buy stocks that don't like meat, or something.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.320]   So it's just a wild business, but it's been a rapidly growing business, and we just go
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:43.240]   back to 1998, you'll see in the next chart, traditional index funds have been growing
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:57.160]   at 99%, ETFs, 19%, and thanks to the market, active managers at 4% a year, so ETFs have
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:02.360]   replaced traditional index funds as the main source of indexing.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:09.880]   Now that brings up an interesting, fascinating point, and that is, where did the growth come
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:17.520]   from that got them bigger than the ETFs, and this chart is a year old, but what you'll
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:26.680]   see there is ETF, exchange traded funds, have had $1 trillion of their $1.9 trillion of
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:33.440]   assets coming from cash flow, people buying them, and $790 billion coming from performance,
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:40.800]   the market, while traditional index funds have had cash flow only half as large, $500
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:58.720]   billion, and market appreciation of $1.1 trillion to get to their $2 billion of growth.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:06.400]   And therefore, when I looked into why we got performance, which is measured by market appreciation,
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:15.460]   on the two sides, we get an 8.4% investor return compared to a 5.5% ETF return, and
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.840]   people will learn from that sooner or later.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:25.400]   My new book is a little more tolerant of ETFs than some of my other words, I don't want
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   to be too tough on them, because they do have good uses, they're just not used nearly enough.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.480]   But they're not the same, and the institutional ownership is very different, if you look at
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:45.360]   the largest traditional index fund, it has turnover, that's our fund, of 21%, and then
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:53.480]   you look at the ETFs, the largest ETFs, our turnover is 135%, which I would have said
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:03.240]   was awfully high, until you look at BlackRock at 435%, and State Street at 1,280% annual
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   turnover.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.920]   I think it's fair to say these are not long-term holders of stocks, they're long-term traders
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.680]   of stocks, they're short-term traders of stocks.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:20.760]   So I'm going to get into the really active ones, the hot shots, ProShares, 2,808% turnover
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:31.720]   of the shares of the fund, and something called Direction, 4,752%, higher than anything else
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   there.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.640]   Those are just places for people to speculate, it's very clear.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   We don't have Invesco in there, do we?
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.880]   Not yet.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.880]   Not yet.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.520]   Okay, well, those that are hanging on to every word, we'll get the Invesco number to you
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.520]   later.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.960]   What we do have going for us in the mutual fund industry and in the index business, particularly
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:57.920]   the index business, is people are always trying to beat the market.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.920]   They don't realize how difficult it is.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:10.920]   Look at how difficult it is from simply saying how competitive market indexes are compared
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.720]   to large groups of mutual funds.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:27.360]   On average, I'm not sure the average is in there, but 93% of the time, 93% of the funds
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.800]   are outperformed by their appropriate indexes.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   93%.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.040]   Just think of that.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.080]   You wonder how anybody can do anything else.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.900]   What's of particular interest in that page, which is a little bit out of sequence here,
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:53.560]   is when you see we have at the bottom line, chart 38, at the bottom line we have the annual
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:59.240]   advantage of the index over the actively managed fund, and you can see these numbers running
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.200]   around 1.5%, 2%.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.000]   I decided to do one other exercise here, just say how are we doing in large cap funds as
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.840]   a group, mid cap funds as a group, small cap funds as a group, and the index advantage
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:22.600]   is in large cap 1.54%, in mid cap 2.01%, and in small cap 2.24%.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:28.800]   This is so intuitive because we know some things about small cap funds, for example.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.840]   One is their fees tend to be higher.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:37.840]   Two, they tend to have a high turnover at a higher cost because they're dealing with
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   smaller stocks.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:46.800]   So, it's an intuitive answer that may even be right, but it's worth thinking about.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:52.840]   It suggests that this is not random, what you've seen about the 93% outperformance,
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   that it all comes out of expenses.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:02.480]   Now, I've been writing that since, I don't know, 1975 I guess, and believe it more than
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:10.080]   ever with each passing day, and have a large number of allies on that same point.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:19.640]   I asked Mike, we didn't get too far on this, but I'd like to see on Google the number of
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:27.300]   times that mutual fund expenses, mutual fund costs, and mutual fund fees were mentioned
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:39.160]   in 1980, and how many times they were mentioned in 1917, in 2017, excuse me, 2080 and 2017.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.520]   I'm sorry, 1980 and 2017, and we couldn't really quite get our hands on that, but it
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:51.880]   looks like it was like 8,000%, 80,000%, the number is just staggering, and we're going
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.160]   to continue to work on that and see if we can't get a better number for you.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:02.700]   But it's become, the idea of expenses has become part of the business of investing.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.240]   It's not a sideline.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.040]   It's not something that no one ever thought about, which they didn't when I came into
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   this business.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:14.600]   Nobody gave it a second thought, and now it's just about everything.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:22.120]   So of course, yeah, the costs are there, and yeah, the index wins, but I like to pick winners,
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.960]   so you pick winners.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:29.200]   And here's a reversion of the mean chart, quite striking, that shows you how difficult
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.960]   it is to pick winners.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:39.080]   If you visualize 20% for each of these columns is the highest return funds, which were 20%
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:50.380]   of the total, 14% of them continued to be in the highest quartile, highest quintile.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:59.840]   And how about worst, 20% fell into the low quintile, and 24%, 44% in the lowest two return
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.400]   categories.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.900]   And this is a very counter, this is a very intuitive chart, too.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:12.520]   It's a little surprising in some areas, and it's probably overstated, that one example.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:20.040]   But the middle, like high and medium, are almost exactly predictable in the middle.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.640]   And they start in the middle, and they're right in the middle.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.960]   So it's at the extremes that you see this.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:32.760]   And of those lower rated stocks at the beginning, 20% lower rated, 30% had higher returns, and
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:39.440]   only 16% had lower returns, lowest returns, and only 10% had low returns.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.400]   That's 26% out of a possible 40.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:50.680]   So you look at that and say, past performance doesn't get you very far.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:56.000]   And in talking to Chairman Clayton on a different occasion, we talked about the possibility
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.580]   of banning the use of past performance figures, because they're so misleading.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.000]   And we know, you know, we can't ban them.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.320]   But people ought to have a much bigger caution than the future may not represent the past
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.880]   or something like that.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.440]   There should be a big warning sign.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.720]   Because the reality is, when you bring out a really hot fund, you know that it will not
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   repeat that record.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.200]   You know that.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.000]   And I think we ought to be able to come across that better.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:36.980]   So okay, so picking in this period, in recent period, it's been an index market, a good
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.120]   market for indexing.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.480]   So what happens when we get into a stock picker's market?
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.560]   Ooh, a stock picker's market.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.640]   There's no such thing now or ever.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.760]   Why?
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:57.520]   Because as I told the professor, each smart investor has to buy what it buys from a dumb
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.520]   investor.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   So-called dumb.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.040]   There's just, I don't know why people don't get it.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.400]   The reality of investing is you're betting against the person that's doing the other
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.360]   side of every trade.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:15.960]   And so we may have stock pickers, good stock pickers, doing well, but we will have bad
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:21.560]   stock pickers doing exactly the same amount of badness as they had goodness.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.200]   So it's just a realization of what the market is.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.320]   And then there is, let's leave the stock market and forget all those performance things and
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:38.120]   go to Bitcoin.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.120]   And this is a happy example.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.320]   My timing wasn't quite right, but I was invited to speak at the Council of Foreign Relations
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:51.760]   in New York on November 28th, '17, and I was asked my first question.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   First question I was asked.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:58.640]   Of course, it was New York City and a lot of financial people in the room, big crowd.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.320]   And someone said, "What did I think of Bitcoin?"
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:07.080]   And I answered with my usual tact, "Avoid it like the plague."
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.060]   And so how good was that advice?
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:16.080]   I also added, "And don't tell me I'm wrong when it gets to $20,000.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.160]   I'll tell you what it's worth when it gets to a dollar.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.600]   Might as well be extreme."
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   And it got to $20,000 or almost $20,000 a week or two later, and there's the dissent.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.480]   It's just a speculation.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:39.620]   So maybe it will do well, maybe it won't, because speculators control their own returns
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.840]   and things get bid up.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.200]   There's no fundamental value here.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:54.400]   And so if you have a little tiny bit of Bitcoin, I wouldn't con you out of it, but I'm disinclined
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.680]   to do it at all.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.360]   As you can imagine, I wouldn't dream of doing it myself.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.560]   It's one more speculation, you don't need that.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.480]   And now we're going to turn to a little different subject, factor investing.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:12.720]   And I want to start off with the big factor, value stocks versus gross stocks.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:18.240]   And this is the chart that got me into all that trouble in Larry Siegel's article.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:25.960]   And you can see right here what I'm saying, and that is up until 1972, value did much
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:30.160]   better, 10.7% return versus 8.8%.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:37.640]   When you take it over all those years, almost, what would that be, 30, 32, 33 years, or is
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   it 40?
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.920]   Well, you do the math for me, Mike.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.720]   And it's the difference is staggering.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.320]   Why would anybody buy anything but value?
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.120]   Oh, there we are.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.120]   It's right there.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:57.320]   Well, even for the full period today, it's 11.3 and 9.2.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:04.640]   And so value is worth $1,141,000, I'm sorry, we should have these in dollars, but it's
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:12.880]   up $1,491,000, and gross is up a mere 269,000%.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.540]   That's the full period in the chart, '28 to '17.
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.000]   We're talking about 90 years.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.360]   But look what happens in the chart.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:31.400]   The advantage of value is steady, moderate, all the way up until 1972.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.600]   And that's where the big advantage is.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.640]   And then it's pretty quickly going to come to an end.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:45.080]   And if you go back to 1973, it's an all-time high, that's the ratio of one to the other.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.960]   And now it's 5.5.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:53.880]   So it was 4.5 in, it looks like, 1980.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:59.160]   So basically since 19—let's see if I've got this right—well, 1999, let's use the
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:08.800]   number on the chart, value has done 6%—1999, that doesn't look right.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   Is that right, Mike?
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.000]   6.2 and 4.8?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:23.480]   But if you look at 1988 to 1999, value 21.3—I'm sorry, value 15.9 and growth 21.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.320]   So you can see there are cycles of growth.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.800]   And this is what got me into all that trouble with Larry Swedbro.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:36.580]   First, he didn't—he said, "I'd pick this chart from mutual funds, value and growth,"
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.840]   and I didn't.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:46.280]   But it doesn't—nobody knows whether value will do better than growth.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:51.160]   All I was trying to do was illuminate the fact that if you think something will be better
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.240]   forever, it's highly unlikely that it will be better forever.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:00.720]   And when you break down things—and I love this little one-under-one chart we call it,
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.780]   sometimes the Bogle chart, because that shows you, you know, if you're starting to look
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.560]   at something and say, "How did growth and value do?" and you see 11.3 percent versus
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   9.2, it's a fact, but it's so different when you look at the various cycles of value
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   and growth.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.680]   I mean, it's just—looks like randomness to me.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.560]   So I don't believe it.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:36.060]   Another vanguard, first, is we created the first two factor funds.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:43.680]   1993, I had said in a speech a year or so before that the creation of growth and value
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:49.080]   index funds awaits only the creation of growth and value indexes.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:54.220]   And when Standard & Poor's created them in 1993, we quickly started our two funds.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:59.200]   They happen to be the two oldest and the two largest so-called strategic beta funds, factor
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.620]   funds, whatever.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:06.200]   Don't be mad at me for that.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:12.180]   What I did was I thought very rational, and that is you could accumulate—it was not
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:18.480]   a terrible strategy—you accumulate money in growth funds where you had a lower income
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:26.000]   and therefore lower tax deduction until you retire, and then you go into value index funds,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.140]   have a higher yield, which you want then and need then, a little lower volatility and much
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.820]   higher income.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.180]   So that was the reason for creating them.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:45.160]   And when I did, I was not born yesterday, I said, "Don't trade them.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:50.940]   The returns over the next 25 years have to be the same, growth and value."
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:59.540]   I am not sure how many people would have said that, but if you read the end of this, "Resist
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:04.860]   the temptation to abandon," this is from a 1994 annual report, "to abandon one strategy
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:09.780]   and move to another, inevitably after performance disappointments."
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:16.660]   And the next year I was even stronger in my trying to remind investors that these are
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:21.340]   not to be traded, they are not factor funds in the sense that you think value is doing
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.980]   better than growth, or growth is doing better than value.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.460]   I am going to read most of this.
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:30.540]   You may recall, and I mentioned to you one year ago, that various market segments seem
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:36.800]   to enjoy cycles of superiority in their unpredictable returns, but over longer periods their respective
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.660]   returns tend to converge to be sure investors must stick to their objectives with consistency
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:47.380]   and firmness, ignoring the siren songs that suggest that moving money back and forth from
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:52.000]   one segment to another will result in a sustainable advantage.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.780]   Such market timing is all too likely to be self-defeating.
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:01.340]   Whichever of the trust portfolios you have selected, a long-term, steady-as-she-goes
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:06.500]   approach is virtually certain to be the most productive strategy.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:14.260]   Now the record, well, my guess, and this is really a good guess, that the returns would
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:20.700]   be the same over that 25-year period, 24-year period, certainly came true.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:27.740]   Growth index fund 9.52% and value index fund 9.64%.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.780]   You really can't get much closer than that.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:34.860]   I don't know if I was really making a prediction, but it certainly came out nicely for the fund's
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.840]   first quarter century.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:42.780]   But look at the investor returns below those 9.52 and 9.64.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:47.380]   The investor, these are investor returns, not fund returns, and the investors lag the
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:54.540]   fund by 2.2% a year in growth and by 1.3% in value.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:52:01.620]   So the net result when you accumulate them is the investors fell short of the fund return
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:11.280]   by 385%, that's just accumulating all of those twos and ones, and in value index they
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:18.940]   fell 264% short.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:24.900]   What more information do you need to say it's just not a good idea to have funds that are
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:29.140]   traded because people go with the hot fund of the day?
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:33.500]   And so overall, I won't spend too much time on this chart which has too many numbers,
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:39.140]   it's my fault, not anybody else's, but just take a look at the bottom line on this
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:44.440]   idea of long-term value advantage.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:55.300]   And you can see in 2014 through 2018, the value lost in 2014, lost in 2015, lost big
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:02.260]   in 2016, lost in 2017, and lost in 2018.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:07.340]   That is a lot of losses for people that think their future is in value, which just began
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:13.860]   with all these factor funds back in around 2014 is when factor funds started to come
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.860]   into play.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:20.660]   It's what you expect to happen when something gets popular and sometimes it doesn't, sometimes
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:26.060]   it doesn't, I'll admit that, but when something gets popular, it's probably a good idea
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.340]   to avoid it.
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:34.580]   And when mutual fund companies are advertising and hyping and promoting these funds and even
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:39.340]   giving them shaky records by buying new issues and stuff when they're small, you want
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:42.040]   to avoid that as much as you can.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:47.060]   But there we are looking down the chart, the Vanguard growth index, 86 million, almost
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:54.620]   twice as big as contender, and value index almost twice as big as its big contender.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:54:03.100]   So these two lousy ideas prove to be—the two ideas which together make sense separately
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:11.120]   do not make sense, and yet here we have what you see there, and that is the—it's not
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:15.860]   anywhere near extreme, I'll admit that, as I expected, but you can see that in the
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:28.660]   value index, you shoot up from 2.1 billion, I guess, in 2015 to 8.4 billion in 2018, as
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.300]   all this catches on.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:38.140]   But I think it will go down, and you can see that the other value funds, a number of the
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.620]   other value funds category have gone down.
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:51.020]   So just one more argument, and I know I don't need to make it here, to buying and holding
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:58.280]   the market forever, don't shift, stay the course, you've heard that before.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:07.220]   Now Vanguard recently brought out some new factor funds to which Bloomberg said, "Add
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:13.340]   the hot sauce, hold the bogo."
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.220]   I think that's a very accurate description.
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.540]   They've actually done okay.
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:25.300]   There's their return in short term, March through August, and they've done very nicely
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:33.120]   in performance, but for better or for worse, they have not attracted much investor attention.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:39.820]   You will see that value is the biggest, but all these other things, I'm sorry, value
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:44.620]   is the biggest individual factor, and when they're all collective, that's even bigger.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.860]   But they're all in the million dollar mark, and that's small change for us.
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.700]   So I take, I guess, some comfort from that.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:56:00.700]   And let me just say this, I try to avoid criticizing Vanguard as much as I possibly can.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:07.300]   I can never, never say something that I believe to be untrue.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:13.740]   And so we have arguments about size, and I get in trouble.
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:19.400]   I hear, never directly from anybody, but I hear when I say, "Vanguard may be getting
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:27.720]   too big," and I get criticism for that, to which I respond in my usual tactful way.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:32.480]   If every member of our top management isn't worried about getting too big, they should
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   be fired.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.840]   Did I make myself clear?
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:45.660]   And another one is international versus U.S., and I don't know if Jason is here today, but
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.960]   he had a very good article about it last week.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:48.960]   Is he here?
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   Go ahead.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:50.960]   Where are you, Jason?
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.960]   I just stepped out.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:57.440]   Well, that was a hell of a time to do that.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:05.840]   You can tell him I gave him an accolade.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:11.320]   But he said in his article, and I'm now on the S&P versus IFA cumulative returns, that
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:16.840]   one in the one chart, that you shouldn't write off international, or non-U.S., I should say,
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.020]   much more accurately.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.040]   And there's nothing about it with saying that at all.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   He may be right.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.960]   He may be wrong.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.960]   I may be right.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.220]   I may be wrong.
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:32.360]   But the first time I made my prediction in 1993 was in my book, Bogo on Mutual Funds,
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:40.120]   and I talked about balance and diversification, and I said you do not need to own any non-U.S.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:48.240]   stocks, gave my reasoning, and if you do want to own non-U.S. stocks, no more than 20 percent.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:55.280]   That turned out to be a little bit like growth in value, a remarkable impression comment,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:05.360]   because from 1993 to today, to this date roughly, the S&P is up 9.8 percent a year, and the
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:10.440]   IFA is up 6.2 percent a year.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:15.840]   Now like so many other things, those little percentages conceal so much.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:22.980]   If you accumulate those percents, those that stuck with the S&P 500 had a 904 percent gain,
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:26.640]   and those that stayed in IFA had a 341 percent gain.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.280]   That's a huge difference.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:34.280]   I don't think you ever make that up, not for a long time anyway, but when Jason says you
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:39.520]   should not give up on non-U.S., I'm inclined to agree with him, because when something
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:48.320]   has done so well for so long, I mean look at that trend from about 2005 to 2018, and
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:55.440]   look at the overall trend from 1993 to 2018 with that one interruption, and it seems it's
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:04.640]   not going to go on forever, but I'm still a U.S. market believer myself.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:11.600]   Now let's talk about competition, Vanguard and the mutual fund marketplace, and something
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.160]   difficult is going on here.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:17.680]   I presume it will persist for the end of the year, but I don't even know that.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.080]   Look at Vanguard's cash flows.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:23.200]   These are annualized.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:30.240]   The 2018 data are annualized, and from $359 billion inflow last year, it looks like we'll
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.440]   do around $212 billion this year.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.000]   That's a big drop.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.880]   I think when I talked to you last year, and we were at the $359 billion mark, I raised
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.760]   the question of what is enough?
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:50.880]   Well, apparently $359 billion is enough, and I don't regard this with any panic or any
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   concern.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:57.600]   I regard it as natural, and this business is getting more and more competitive, and
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.480]   I'll show you that in a second, but I can't tell you that that gap is going to hold through
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   the year.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.560]   We still have September, October, November, and December, but for the first eight months
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.360]   annualized, we're way behind last year, and I'm sure we'll end the year behind last
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.440]   year no matter what.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:25.240]   Now, when we look at that cash flow slowdown, and this is year-to-date.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:39.560]   We didn't annualize these data, and you'll see that in 2017, we did—this year-to-date,
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:46.840]   I can't even read my own writing—our volume on traditional index funds, that would be
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:01:00.960]   our big strength, is down from $137 billion to $75 billion.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:07.920]   Our ETFs are down even more, $94 billion to $49 billion.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:16.400]   And our total funds are down by more than half, $244 billion to $112 billion.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.080]   That's essentially what you saw in the previous chart.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:27.000]   So when you look at the overall picture, you'll see that it's—except for TIFs, traditional
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.620]   index funds, where our market share is going from 81% to 60%, and that may be some big
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.080]   liquidations from—I just don't know.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:40.560]   Maybe liquidations up, maybe volumes down, but it's certainly a warning sign.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:50.200]   And our ETFs were 33% of ETF business last year, and 35% for the first eight months this
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.420]   year.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.320]   So that's actually improving.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:58.520]   And our total share of mutual fund business, despite that big drop, is at 53%.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.880]   And I don't think it's possible.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.600]   We have an industry issue as well as, to some extent, at least a Vanguard issue.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.920]   And we're always going to be based on the industry, one way or the other.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.240]   And if the industry does well, we will do well.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.280]   Maybe better, maybe worse, but well, and the same in reverse, and vice versa.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.560]   So it's gotten to be a very competitive business.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.160]   You know all that.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.240]   Most recently, Fidelity with zero funds—and they even have zero in the name of the funds.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.400]   They can't very easily walk away from it.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.040]   So they're going to be selling their index funds at zero, and they've reduced accordingly
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.880]   their other funds.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:43.480]   And that's going to be tough competition, particularly when you get into the million
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.440]   or two million or the three million or four million.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.720]   That's going to be tough competition for new business, and I think not, I hope, not
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:58.040]   for old business, because if somebody with $3 million with a cost basis of $1 million
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:05.640]   shifts into Fidelity and pays a 26% tax on $2 million, it's going to take a long time
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:12.480]   for that 0.1% or 0.4% to be justified, that saving.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.560]   So it's not the end of the world.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.720]   And it is, you know, when you think about it.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:25.320]   And I like to look at things this way, and I think, what would I do if I was in the box
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.240]   that Fidelity was in?
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.400]   They mocked the index fund at the beginning.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:38.780]   Ned Johnson said, "Our clients would never be satisfied with market returns."
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:43.240]   And they weren't getting them either, that's another story.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.040]   And so now they are on the bandwagon.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.800]   And so we'll talk, there's another little chart about which will show Fidelity.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:57.240]   But they've clearly made an effort, or are making an effort, to make a big show in the
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.240]   index business and make nothing.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   Make nothing.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.620]   Well, how is that possible?
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:09.300]   Because the rest of their business last year, all businesses, not just the fund business,
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:14.120]   but the recordkeeping business and so on, had a net profit, operating profit of, was
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.120]   it 2.9?
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:20.120]   Was that a yes?
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.880]   And the profit of their company is 2.9 billion.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.000]   And it really doesn't matter whether they bring in this money at zero basis points or
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.420]   two basis points or three.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.440]   It's going to be a big loss leader for them.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.760]   But they've got this huge package.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.320]   And so it's what I would do, I think, if I were Fidelity.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.640]   You know, you got to break in, you blew it for all those years.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:45.320]   Let's do something wild and dramatic and advertise the hell out of it.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.240]   And so that's what they have done.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:53.520]   Nonetheless, we still dominate the industry cash flow, Vanguard, up to date.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:05:01.680]   It's amazing that since 2015, actually since 2014, January of 2015, the industry has done
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:08.080]   $1.2 trillion, of which Vanguard has done $961 billion.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.560]   And all other firms put together $241 billion.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.280]   So we've been doing 80 percent.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:23.560]   Eighty percent, I mean, it's so unprecedented, it almost takes your breath away.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.880]   But you know it will not continue.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.280]   Anyone who thought that would continue is just a damn fool, because things don't go
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.280]   on forever.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280]   Trees don't go to the sky.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.580]   You've heard all the things.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.400]   But indexing is still the key to what we do here at Vanguard.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.920]   I guess I'm still allowed to say "we."
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.280]   And you can see that it's helped our whole business.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:53.280]   And we started at 5.9 percent market share back in '74, and stock and bond funds only,
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.560]   and actually went down in 1986.
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.480]   I forget how I explained that in 1986, but I probably didn't talk about it.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.800]   That would be more likely for me.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.640]   Talk about how much our assets have grown, how much our shares have fallen.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.040]   And then it's been onward and upward almost every year, if not every year, higher market
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040]   share.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.520]   At 24.6, no one else has ever gotten anywhere close to that.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:21.200]   The old industry maximum was 15 percent, and we're way ahead of that.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.480]   So that is going to be very hard to sustain in a more competitive world.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.680]   So let's see what the competitive world looks like.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.620]   Here are the assets of our large competitors.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:47.280]   We were at this time 4.9 trillion, Fidelity 2.1 trillion, so we're 2.8 trillion larger
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:53.960]   than Fidelity, and we were $204 billion back at the beginning of that chart.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.040]   That's one of the most remarkable turnarounds, and it gives me a lot of comfort in the sense
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.520]   that it's helped a lot of people to invest more wisely.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:06.360]   You can see BlackRock is growing steadily, but still even smaller than Fidelity.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.920]   American Funds, which uses stockbrokers very widely, is kind of holding its own on assets
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.120]   and losing market share.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:20.680]   And then the new entrant, State Street, is of course $751 billion, is by and large an
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.000]   index fund.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:29.400]   So we have Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, all of the big three of indexing.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.640]   Three of exchange-traded funds.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.440]   And I also thought we didn't do this, we showed you that chart last year, but I thought
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.320]   we'd do this, show this chart.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:45.200]   These are kind of the winners of the last 18 years, this century so far.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.120]   And here are people who don't look like such good winners.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:54.680]   You can see they've grown a lot, starting with Invesco, and that's the green line.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:59.680]   They've grown from $297 to $434 billion, way behind the industry.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.680]   Putnam.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:06.040]   Poor Putnam, I mean, I tried to get them to mutualize, you probably heard that.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.000]   It's in the new book, I tell the story of trying to get them to mutualize.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.400]   And their assets have gone from $234 billion to $76 billion.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.840]   They're down, what would that be, 60% or something?
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.280]   And they're 80%, I don't know.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.840]   You do the percent for me, Mike.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.200]   Actually down in assets in this boom period for everybody else.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:37.920]   And I know, this proud old name, went the wrong way, and is paying the price for it.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.120]   And anybody that looks at that chart from Vanguard, who doesn't realize there is such
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.440]   a thing as the wrong way, and we better keep doing it the right way, or we will be doing
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.600]   exactly the same thing.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.480]   And Janus had its ups and downs, as you can see.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.880]   I guess that's the green line.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.600]   And it's down a little bit after a big bump in 2006.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.760]   They're just steadily down.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.400]   The one that stands out here is, of course, PIMCO, started at $55 billion, and is now
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.400]   $375 billion.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.400]   No mean accomplishment.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:18.120]   But when they had the great Bill Gross, who, alas, my friend Bill Gross, is not doing so
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.520]   well with the fund he runs for Janus, but they had his, and when he left, look at that
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.080]   drop in assets.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.920]   And that's another risk to which Vanguard is not exposed.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.400]   We don't have anybody that was ever that dominant in assets.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:35.080]   So there's the other side of the street, how difficult this business is.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.680]   I want to spend a minute now on kind of a fun thing, and that is talk about two companies
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.520]   that were big competitors at the beginning of the period.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:55.720]   When I came into this business, Vanguard being much smaller, $154 million compared to $386
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:05.040]   million per mass investor's trust, and that, you will recall, was the company that was
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.400]   written up in the article in Fortune that caught my eye and brought me into this industry.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:15.240]   So I have a kind of a kinship with them, at least I feel that way.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:22.260]   And you can see that we had pretty much caught up to them by 1980, and now the semi-log chart
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:32.600]   doesn't really do justice to the change, but the numbers speak for themselves.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:43.760]   We're both $2.6 billion in 1980, and now we're $4.6 trillion, and they are $234 billion.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:51.280]   God, I can't keep the damn thing straight, I must be getting old.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.760]   It's fascinating to see how that could happen, and that's this next chart which puts it into
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.840]   a little different perspective.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:06.560]   That's market share for the two of us, 15% MIT, and now Mass Financial, they brought
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:14.240]   a new company that ran MIT and other funds, 15%, 7%, 3%, 1%.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.500]   They really can't get any, you can get lower than 1%, but they're just kind of holding
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:24.400]   their own now, as you can see, 1% in 2010, 1% in 2018.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:31.680]   Their vanguard is 6, 5, crosses the line, 5, 15, 25.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.600]   How could that have happened?
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.360]   Well, read the note in the middle.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.520]   Through 1969, Mass Financial was run by its own trustees.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.520]   It was sort of a quasi-vanguard, they didn't do distribution or anything, and they didn't
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:55.840]   do administration, but the trustees ran it, and it was very cheap.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.200]   Expense ratio in 1969 was 0.20.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.520]   Then they went private.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:07.240]   The trustees, in their wisdom, privatized the company and gave themselves the stock.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:14.160]   Trustees give themselves the stock, I mean, I find that kind of not so good, and the expense
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:19.480]   ratio immediately goes up to 0.75, not immediately, but in a decade.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:24.160]   And then, not satisfied, I guess, with how well they're doing, they sell to Sun Life
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.520]   of Canada.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:31.600]   So in 1980, since 1980, they've been owned by a financial conglomerate, and the expense
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.940]   ratio has gone up to 1.2% for the average fund.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:43.320]   That's six times what it was in 1969 when these lines began to think about crossing.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.040]   So what about Vanguard?
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.120]   We were private until 1960, expense ratio of 41.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:57.160]   We were public until 1974, that was a bad thing, and the expense ratio went up to 0.79.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:02.620]   And today, we are mutual, and the expense ratio is 0.15.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:10.020]   So it's an interesting story that in 1974, early in the mid-1974, as our directors at
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:17.200]   Wellington were trying to figure out the best way whether to go along with my idea to mutualize.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.920]   And so, of course, they went up to Boston to see the trustees of Mass Investors Trust,
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:27.500]   and the trustees of Mass Investors Trust said to them, "You guys must be crazy.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.400]   We just did the opposite thing.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   We know what's going on.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.520]   We did the opposite, and here it is.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.080]   You tell me who's crazy there."
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:45.280]   So they withstood that, and the directors blessed them, and it all lies in, I think,
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:51.240]   mutualization, trying to run mutual funds for their shareholders and not for their managers.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.120]   And we'll hear more and more and more about that.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.160]   So Vanguard share of index assets keeps rising.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.760]   Believe it or not, I mean, we're at 84% back in 1985.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.320]   We didn't have much competition at all, and we dropped to 44%, but since 2006, we are
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:12.680]   actually going over the 50% mark in index fund total assets.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.360]   That number is going to come down.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:22.760]   Our regular share of assets is, in TD, traditional index fund, obviously my choice as a way to
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:32.280]   invest is come down a little bit, but our huge growth in ETF, share of ETF index assets
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.200]   is all the way up to 35% now.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:43.760]   So it's all different, and we have a little problem of concentration, and I'll talk about
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:53.440]   that in a minute a little more, but -- what's my time?
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.920]   Is it okay if I go on a little bit longer?
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   I thought you'd say that.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.280]   Sorry, just too much to cover.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:10.920]   We have an issue about the concentration of index fund assets in three firms, and I have
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:16.240]   used the word oligopoly, which I think is the correct word, or in management, properly
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.240]   perhaps.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:23.680]   I don't like the term oligopoly, but certainly the term big three fits this with dominated
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:33.000]   by ETFs entirely, and we're up there because of our share of the TIF market, and so you
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:46.640]   see the big three with 71, 80% of total index assets, and that is a lot of concentration,
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.760]   and that is a lot of firms, but an oligopoly usually is firms that get together and keep
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:57.380]   prices high, and the problem with this oligopoly, if such should be, is that we keep prices
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:02.800]   so low that no other providers want to enter the business except Fidelity, and they have
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.960]   their own entryway to do it, and they will become more important, so they will become
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:14.000]   one of the big four, I think, in a period of a decade.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.720]   Concentration of assets, I'm going to skip that one that I just talked about.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:27.160]   Fidelity is in there, 12% of the TIF business, and Fidelity's equity assets are now 25% of
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:32.200]   their total, index assets are 25% of their total equity assets.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:38.400]   It's growing a lot, but there are threats to the index fund, and they are big threats,
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:46.640]   and I don't know, can I have that sheet, Mike, I don't have the same thing you do.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   Do you have it, Andy?
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.320]   We won't wait.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:17:01.480]   The first one is, it's a big move, academic move, to ban the ownership, common ownership
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.200]   of funds in a given industry.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:11.800]   That is to say, a fund can own no more than one airline stock, one bank stock, one this.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:16.200]   No large investor can own more than one company per industry.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:21.160]   That's in the abstract, I don't know what to call it, it's not ridiculous, but it's
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.560]   not true.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.040]   We have probably seven airline stocks.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.920]   By the way, the only example I ever use is the airlines.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:37.000]   Their businesses are very different, but it would do away with the index fund, and the
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:44.520]   S&P 500 index fund would become the S&P 173, let me say.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:49.920]   I've been after these writers for two years to tell me what that number is.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.560]   Okay, we're going to do what you say.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:57.600]   How many stocks do we own, so I can tell you the S&P 500, and in two years, I have yet
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.600]   to get an answer.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:03.920]   I don't know why it's so difficult.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:14.120]   They have their view that's anti-competitive, legal implications, the Clayton Act bans possible
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:21.080]   cooperation among companies, and they want to argue that owning all airline stocks, using
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:28.200]   their example, we're telling the airlines keep prices high and keep wages low, and we'll
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.560]   make sure your competitors do the same.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.400]   As if we had that much of a voice with the airlines.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:39.120]   So there's that issue, and there's who decides what an industry is.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.120]   It's very complicated.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:47.280]   It ends up probably being a government bureaucrat, and it would destroy the equity, it would
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:52.920]   destroy the S&P 500, and it would be a terrible problem for people like American Funds, which
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:19:00.960]   has lots of holdings in each industry, but the worst impact would be on the large index
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.160]   funds.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.960]   And they're well-meaning, perfectly decent people.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.520]   Actually one of them is a friend of mine who was the valedictorian at Princeton in 2007,
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:15.360]   and he's still a friend of mine, he's allowed to think what he wants, but they write pretty
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:23.120]   violently about, they tell us that the index fund is the cause of the golden age, the gilded
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.120]   age that we have today.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.320]   Well, that's a little pushy.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:32.440]   The other threat is, I'm going to use this example, the hidden power of the Big Three.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.880]   This is a concentration of ownership.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:40.640]   The likelihood that in the near future, roughly 12 individuals, I would use a smaller number,
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.480]   will have practical power over the majority of U.S. public companies.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:51.560]   And that is a concerning issue, a real issue, unlike the issue of common ownership.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.440]   It's almost the other side.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.780]   And think about that.
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:02.920]   They say 12, I'd say six individuals might be more like it, will have practical power
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.520]   to control a majority of U.S. public companies.
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:15.460]   Right now, Vanguard's about eight, BlackRock's about eight, and State Street's about four.
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.680]   And that's 20% now.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.120]   How long will it take that 20% to go to 30%?
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120]   I don't know.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.000]   It's going to have to slow down.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.120]   And I think I can guarantee to you, this might sound like a funny statement, that we will
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.040]   never get there.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:40.520]   U.S. public policy will never permit Vanguard or any other large giant institution from
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:44.080]   having practical power over the majority of U.S. public companies.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.840]   I can't tell you why it will happen, I can't tell you when it will happen, but I can tell
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.000]   you it will happen.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.480]   It's just not going to be allowed for a few individuals, really, chief executives of these
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:03.800]   management companies, these individuals, to control American business.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:04.800]   I mean, it would be absurd.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.800]   Who the hell are they?
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.600]   I mean, I was one of them, I know.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.040]   I couldn't control American business.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.960]   I wouldn't even want to think about trying.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:21.520]   So that's yet two big issues, but I'm sure the S&P 500, as everybody knows, the greatest
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:32.000]   invention for the individual investor in the history of finance, we're never going to get
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:41.760]   a Congress to approve this kind of divestiture, leaving aside the tax impact and all that.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:48.280]   So it's not going to happen that way, but growth will slow down and there may be a whole
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:51.560]   lot of new ways to deal with the issue of governance.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:56.160]   I'm going to skip the next two in the interest of time, it's about time.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:01.200]   Just to say on these two, I'm just pointing out that we are really more of an index company
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:07.840]   than anybody knows or thinks, because so many of our stocks are so closely correlated with
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:12.460]   their target indexes or target competitive groups.
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:19.880]   In Wellington Fund, 97% of Wellington Fund's performance is explained, for example, by
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:31.120]   the performance of the S&P 500, 65%, and the Barclays Bloomberg bond index, total bond
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.920]   market index, 35%, and its competitors too.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:42.280]   So we have just about all of our big funds have that kind of a number, 95, 96, 97.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.300]   Time caps an exception, and a nice exception.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:49.040]   Now as to future returns, you've probably read what I've had to say about this, we're
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:23:01.080]   looking for, we'll go through this quickly, Mike, 4% for stocks, and you can see 6% fundamental
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:06.120]   return minus 2% speculative return, lower valuations.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:15.000]   And for bonds, way below, since 1974, 8% versus 3.5%.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:22.960]   So I think combination returns of bonds and stocks could be, and we will use this chart,
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:30.440]   could be more like 4% compared to 12%, these are equities only, 12% over Vanguard's history.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.440]   12%.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:39.280]   I mean you guys that have been investors that time, most of it, last, well I've got 60 years
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:45.160]   here, nobody's been that, but 60 years is kind of an investor's lifetime today.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.040]   And look what happens when you compound at 12% versus 4%.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:54.320]   And the math is easy, you divide that number into 72 and see how often it will double.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:00.200]   So at 12% you double every 6 years, and at 4% you double it every 18 years.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:08.680]   So at 4% after 60 years, your original dollar goes to $11, and at 12% your original dollar
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.800]   goes to $898.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.880]   So small differences in return, or even big differences in return, big differences in
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:23.960]   return, more or less than I expect, suggest that we are basically, our reasonable expectations
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:34.720]   are better save more money, better save more money, better get more costs out of the equation,
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:43.440]   and so when I get to, I'm going to go over to 72 now, I guess I'm not alone.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.040]   My number for future equity returns are around 4%.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:54.180]   It's shared by just about everybody, it's amazing, AQR, which is Cliff Asness, 4.2%,
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:25:02.560]   Keith Ambach, Canadian, writes a really refined, thoughtful newsletter, 4.5%, BlackRock 4,
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:09.480]   Vanguard 3-5, GMO, that's Jeremy Grantham, minus 4.7, that's the only outlier, State
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.760]   Street 4.1.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:18.160]   So do I take cover in this, being the same as everybody else?
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.240]   No, because I was brought up with the idea that the crowd is always wrong.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.960]   So who knows what to expect?
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.800]   You don't need to take that as gospel.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:38.680]   And in the wrapping up, I'm going to skip the wrapping up page and go to
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.680]   the book.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.920]   And what number do you have for the Princeton?
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:48.120]   No, I want to do—where does this go?
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:53.440]   All right, okay, now to the book.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:58.280]   This will be a little fun way to end.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:06.320]   I chose the title of "Stay the Course" after a foray into a couplet by Johnny Cash,
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.240]   which ends, "The songs I sang will still be sung."
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.160]   And everybody hated the title except me.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.480]   And that made me even more determined to do it.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:26.200]   But then Johnny Cash of the state wanted $25,000 for the use of that.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.440]   And I told the publisher, I was about to tell the publisher, "Tell them $2,500 and that's
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.440]   it.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:32.440]   We're out of here."
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.760]   I woke up the next morning, and I thought, "The hell with that.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.560]   We're out of here anyway."
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.920]   So I changed it into a much better title, "Stay the Course, the Story of Vanguard
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.480]   and the Index Revolution."
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:51.960]   And it turns out to be not just an investor's motto, a winning investor's motto, stay
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.600]   the course with your investment program, but an entrepreneur's motto.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:01.960]   A lot of it in the book is a lot about this, about how tough it is to really build a company
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.320]   out of nothing, to build a skeleton into a full body.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.000]   And so it's also the title of a book, as well as those mottos, those two different
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.880]   mottos for investors and for entrepreneurs.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   And here's the cover.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:23.520]   I saw the cover of Jim Comey's book, and I said to the publisher, "I am really
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.520]   pain in the neck."
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:28.740]   And I said, "I want the cover of my new book to look exactly like that.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:35.920]   So if you think this looks exactly like Jim Comey's book cover, you're right."
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:42.400]   Now we're running much too long, I'm sorry.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.540]   We'll hand these out, I think.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:48.840]   But we have great endorsements.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:54.280]   The nicest one by far from Paul Volcker, who really reveled in the book.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:28:02.380]   Another one from Cliff Asness, you'd think a competitor who's into alternative investments.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:06.420]   Very big, a couple of hundred billion dollars.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:11.700]   Might not like indexing, he loves indexing, and I think you could say he loves me.
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:17.000]   Jim Collins, another one, best-selling author of Good to Great, and co-author of Built to
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.860]   Last, and finally the wonderful Andy Lowe, professor at MIT, who I have a very close
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:27.880]   relationship with and interviewed with him and all that kind of thing.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.220]   So it has a good heritage.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.580]   It has a—here's the—state of the course, here's the table of contents.
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.060]   You won't be able to read them now.
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:46.300]   But it just takes Vanguard through various eras in the tough—it was not easy to build
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:51.160]   Vanguard, and it took a long time for indexing to catch on.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:57.100]   And you'd be amazing, at least I was amazed, at the number of things I had done that we
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.460]   had to do to stay alive.
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:06.260]   We had to create a lot of funds, and most people didn't like any of them.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:12.800]   Everybody loved Prime Cap, by the way, afterward.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:21.700]   So I wrote the book around the idea of landmarks, and with the seven or eight steps that had
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:28.380]   to be taken to get that little skeleton doing very little of anything when Vanguard started,
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:33.480]   the new company, 28 employees, to get into the largest company in the world.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:42.380]   And so it was a landmarks kind of book, and I read it about the third time and I thought,
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:46.300]   this book really stinks.
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:51.640]   I didn't like the way it was written, because it left out the most important thing of all,
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:57.380]   and that is the character of Vanguard, what I tried to build into this firm in terms of
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:04.240]   people, including all of you, including the people that work there and work here, and
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.160]   all of our shareholders.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:11.760]   And so I added a chapter called Caring, the Founder's Legacy, and then I changed the
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.880]   earlier chapters, amended them, and I think we actually have a pretty good book.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:16.880]   That's the first part.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:21.000]   That's the guts of the book, the first ten chapters.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.760]   Part two is chapters on the individual funds.
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:27.920]   You know, you can talk about Vanguard till hell-freezes over, but if you don't talk
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.840]   about Wellington Fund, if you don't talk about the index fund, if you don't talk
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:35.480]   about the Windsor funds, don't talk about the bond funds, the Prime Cap funds.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.680]   And then in chapter 16, the funds that failed.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.160]   This book is, by the time you get through reading this book, if you do, you'll think
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:47.120]   that Vogel is probably the biggest jerk ever to come across.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:51.040]   I linger on my mistakes, of which there have been so many.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:57.620]   And then part three, the future of investment management, with the last minute only ten
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:02.140]   days ago, I decided to change that from being one chapter to three.
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:07.440]   So the three chapters of the fund industry becomes mutual, the challenge to the S&P 500
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:12.000]   index fund, which I've discussed, and then chapter 19 is the Financial Institutions Act
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.200]   of 2030.
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:17.800]   We will get new legislation because the old legislation doesn't fit the new industry.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:23.320]   So I thought I'd learn about the future of investment management by having a private
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.320]   seminar.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:29.600]   I picked Princeton University to do it in and invited the smartest people, the most
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.520]   independent people I knew, a very small group.
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.280]   Do you want to put them up?
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.720]   There we are.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.600]   And there's Cliff Asnesh, you'll see.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:41.600]   There's Gus Sauter.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.000]   I don't know where it is.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   Here it is.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   No.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.720]   Here we are.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.640]   I can't see what you can see.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:57.360]   There's Andy Lowe reading over.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:03.600]   There's Eric Posner, who's one of the leaders of this no more than one company per industry.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.200]   I thought it was a good idea to invite the enemy.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:10.260]   There's John Reckenthaler, not there as a journalist, but as someone who knows the industry
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:12.280]   inside and out.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.280]   There's me.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.280]   There's Burt Malkiel.
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.200]   There's Ted Aronson, local investment advisor, very outspoken.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.200]   There's Gus.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.200]   There's Cliff Asnesh.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:29.840]   And there's the biggest contributor of all, Michael Nolan.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.640]   And it was a fun day.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.040]   We started around 10 and finished at 3.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:41.960]   But this entire group sees very little change ahead.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.680]   They think indexing is going to grow and grow and grow to 75%.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.080]   Now, I do not believe that.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:52.520]   So I got it more as they're wrong.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.520]   And so I wrote my chapter.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.520]   I'd written my chapter before.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.660]   I didn't see any reason to change it on the future of investment management.
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:59.800]   That was the subject of the forum.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:06.000]   But it was an interesting day to see all of us together, advocates and detractors, really
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:13.640]   good minds, really outspoken minds, people that are not known for shyness, led by a person
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:17.120]   that was not known for shyness, I think.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.720]   So that's the story of the last chapter.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.720]   Then there are a bunch of photos.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.720]   You'll like them.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.920]   I stuck two in here.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:28.080]   One is these two handsome guys.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.320]   One is Blair and one is Princeton graduate yearbook pictures.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:36.240]   God, he was a good-looking kid at Blair, and then he started to get fat.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:43.960]   And then as a peculiar coincidence at the Nassau Inn and Princeton Nassau, I guess Nassau
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:50.080]   Inn, the Yankee Doodle taproom has kind of a wall of fame, famous Princetonians.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.220]   And when I was at Princeton, they were all football players and maybe a couple of basketball
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.840]   players thrown in.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.720]   But they've now changed that, and they have business people there.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:06.400]   And right next to each other are what I call two Princeton entrepreneurs.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:12.000]   One is me, people who have been the most destructive entrepreneurs of the modern age, right next
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.120]   to each other on the wall of fame of the Yankee Doodle taproom.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.840]   There's John C. Bogle, and that's, for those who can't read it or don't recognize him,
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.240]   is Jeffrey P. Bezos.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:28.080]   So he did a little better financially than I did.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:35.320]   And you'll also enjoy—this is just a fun one—my mother, who had only lived another
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:44.080]   year, took a picture of me with a little brownie hawkeye and getting my AB degree in 1951.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.380]   You'll see that over on the left here.
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:51.320]   And then when I got my honorary Doctor of Laws degree, there I am again, two different
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.320]   degrees.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:57.640]   So it's fun to have that little run-through time.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:04.120]   And now I am with a decently long quote at the end.
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.440]   Let me say that the book ends with something that I think all of you will enjoy more than
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.000]   anything else in the book.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.560]   I decided I wanted to incorporate a sort of memoir, A. And B, I decided I didn't want
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.320]   to write anymore.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.760]   Writing is very hard for me to do, particularly at this age, I think.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:25.000]   You know, you have transitions, you've got to worry about reputation.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.860]   So I didn't want to write a memoir as such.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:31.400]   So what I decided to do, for the first time in history—and I think this will never be
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:39.200]   adopted by anybody else, but if it is, it worked well for me—I just took the alphabet
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:43.840]   and went right through it and things that mattered to me during my life, anywhere from
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:49.520]   advice to—I don't know, there's obviously four or five paragraphs about Princeton, four
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.400]   or five paragraphs about Blair, two or three paragraphs about American Indian College,
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.600]   and then quotes that I've liked.
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:09.400]   The shortest one is, under G—I have big initials there—under G, "God," and it says, "Is
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:12.400]   there a God?
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.080]   Yes."
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.080]   That's it.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:20.440]   I mean, I didn't know what to add to that.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:25.160]   And I'm just going to quickly—it's a quirky way of doing it, but it's sort of
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:31.040]   fun, and some is very sad, because there's been a lot of sadness in my life.
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:37.040]   I mean, I have far more joy than sadness, but you'll see it, it'll come out to you.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:42.600]   And then, I wanted this to be the last quote, and so it's under—it was going to be the
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:48.240]   universe, but then work would come next, and I wanted this to be the last quote.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:55.000]   So this is the final write-up in the memoir part of the book, in the end of the book.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.680]   You and Me and the Universe.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.780]   Our Earth is but a single planet in the solar system, which in turn is part of the Milky
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:10.720]   Way galaxy, our huge galaxy, a hundred thousand or so light-years in diameter.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:17.760]   Our galaxy, in turn, is but one of at least 200 billion galaxies in our universe, each
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.920]   galaxy with more than 100 billion stars.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:30.240]   If you want to measure the relative importance of a single human being, just do the math.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:37.840]   And yet, and yet, to dwell on our own insignificance in the grand scheme of things doesn't seem
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.120]   particularly useful.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.920]   There's work to be done here on Earth, and we best get on with it.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:48.960]   We might begin by acting before it's too late to save our own planet.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:54.520]   Beyond that, our task is to live productive lives, to raise our families, to contribute
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:38:00.760]   to our communities, and to serve our nation and our global society.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:06.000]   That's the end of the book, and that is, at tortuous end, my remarks this morning.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:27.440]   Thanks for bearing with me.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:54.000]   It's so great to be with you all, and I thank you for another standing O. I don't
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.160]   know how many more years I can do this.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.560]   Nobody knows.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:02.320]   I'm not saying I can, but you'll see a little poetry at the beginning of my book,
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.280]   which suggests—it's a fun book.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.880]   Actually, I love where it is now.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.080]   I hope it'll come out.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.920]   But it's just such a thrill to be able to be with you—I don't know if I'd make
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:24.800]   it or not—and to see all of you, to get your enthusiasm, really feel it as well as
