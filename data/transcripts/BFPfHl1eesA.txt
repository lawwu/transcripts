[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 171.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.760]   So I'm here in my Deep Work HQ, rainy cold day.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   So it's one of those rare days I'm actually happy
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.640]   to be in a windowless room.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.760]   Joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.960]   So Jesse, we're what, two weeks now
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620]   into having the YouTube channel up
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.920]   that features video of every single question
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.400]   that we answer on this podcast,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.500]   as well as video of every deep dive,
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.800]   as well as video of all full episodes.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   We're two weeks into it.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.640]   What's our report?
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.260]   How are things going?
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.220]   Things are going pretty good.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.260]   I think the process is getting honed in
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860]   and people are watching the videos.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.180]   You're getting a bunch of subscribers.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.400]   So keep on putting out more videos
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.280]   and getting the bumpers and beginnings a little bit tighter.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.160]   So all in all, the progress is going pretty good.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.040]   - Good, yeah, and what Jesse was hinting at there
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.040]   is we have a nice visual makeover coming.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.520]   So the briefly, the design firm that is working
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.900]   on the portal in which you're gonna be able
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.800]   to find all these videos and Netflix style carousels
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.860]   without having to go to YouTube,
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.080]   they are helping us just overhaul the look
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.460]   of the YouTube page so it'll be consistent
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.300]   with the new portal.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.520]   So we have nice new looking graphics and logos and bumpers,
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.820]   all that's coming, but Jesse and I got impatient.
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.240]   We didn't wanna wait for all of that to be done
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.620]   before we got these videos up here.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.320]   So we just went ahead.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.680]   So you'll notice over time,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.760]   things get better and better looking.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.200]   So we'll make the bumpers better looking.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.420]   We'll have the logos look better.
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.860]   Eventually we'll use deep fake technology
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.740]   to have a more attractive man.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.600]   You'll hear my voice,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.680]   but coming from like a much more attractive man,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.980]   we're thinking like a young Harrison Ford
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.820]   or something like this.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.100]   So all of that is coming for those of you
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.320]   who care about the aesthetics.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.740]   All right, so here's our plan for today.
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.740]   I wanna continue with these core idea deep dive segments
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.700]   we've been doing.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.420]   And again, the concept here is I wanna go back
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.680]   to a lot of the big ideas that I referenced frequently
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.540]   on this show and do a deep dive dedicated
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.380]   to each of these ideas.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.780]   'Cause now that we have video,
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.940]   that means there will be a video
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.780]   of each of these core idea discussions
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.280]   so that if you wanna go back and reference,
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.780]   oh yeah, what does Cal think about follow your passion?
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.900]   What does Cal think about slow productivity?
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.040]   What does Cal think about deep work?
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.140]   This comes up a lot.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.700]   You can go back and actually find the core idea video.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.260]   It'll also be a quick introduction
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.100]   to the various philosophies we explore here
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.020]   for people who are new to the channel.
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.140]   We've been getting some good feedback.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.820]   So I wanted to keep that going.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.220]   And that's what we're gonna do now.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.260]   The core idea I wanna talk about today
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.140]   is the following question.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.960]   Is slow productivity the solution to burnout?
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.040]   So slow productivity is a emerging topic of thought
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.700]   we've been talking about more and more frequently.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.200]   And I wanna get into it with this core idea.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.860]   All right, let's give some background
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.880]   to where the concept of slow productivity came from,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.580]   what motivated it.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.460]   We are in a moment right now
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.020]   in which there is a popular and visible pushback
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.900]   against the general notion of productivity.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.100]   And by productivity, I mean just the general drive
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.080]   to try to get more things done.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.260]   Now, I think the coronavirus pandemic helped amplify this,
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.660]   but this movement predates the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.780]   If we're gonna use books as a rough proxy
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.520]   for cultural thinking on this topic,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.940]   we can really look to 2019, February of 2019,
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.980]   when Ginny O'Dell published "How to Do Nothing."
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.740]   This book probably helped spark more than anything else
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.020]   this modern moment of anti-productivity thinking.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.700]   It was a popular book, a New York Times bestseller.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.180]   Barack Obama selected it
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.580]   as one of his best books of the year.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.580]   It opened the floodgates to multiple other books
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.000]   along these same lines.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.180]   So we got Celeste Headley's "Do Nothing"
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.980]   that came out soon after.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.140]   I actually interviewed Celeste
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.540]   for a New Yorker piece this fall.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.900]   We got a little bit deeper into this.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.860]   We also got Devin Price had a book called
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.380]   "Laziness Does Not Exist."
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.340]   I blurbed that book.
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.540]   It was a good book.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.780]   Helen Ann Peterson had "Can't Even,"
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.620]   the book-length treatment of her viral BuzzFeed article
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.380]   about millennial burnout.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.940]   More recently, we have Oliver Berkman had "4,000 Weeks,"
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.740]   which I blurbed that book as well.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.580]   It was fantastic.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.540]   That book's really been killing it.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.220]   So there's been this long string of books since 2019
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.740]   that are all basically making the same point.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.580]   We're burnt out.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.700]   We're doing too much.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.780]   We're tired of doing too much.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.580]   I saw this anti-productivity movement
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.740]   even among you, my listeners and readers, in 2020.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.900]   I wrote an essay for my newsletter about this
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.820]   asking, is the term productivity over?
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.620]   Do we need something new?
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.580]   And it led to a really heated discussion
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.660]   and two subsequent follow-up posts.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.700]   So we had a lot of back and forth discussion on this
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.200]   in the spring of 2020 that made it clear
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.340]   that there are a lot of you out there
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.020]   that are just exhausted,
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.820]   exhausted with activity and work,
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.580]   your life outside of work,
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.540]   and need something more than just falling back on
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.780]   how do I get more done?
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.940]   All right, so that is the modern anti-productivity movement.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.880]   Here's the issue.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.980]   The question left unanswered in a lot of this work
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.680]   is what should we do about it?
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.320]   We all agree, and these books are doing well,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.760]   because we all feel exhausted,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.080]   but the question is what should we do about it?
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.120]   And my opinion here is that we haven't had
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.680]   a lot of fully featured answers.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.960]   The typical response that we will get
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.400]   to what we should do about it is basically just
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.440]   do less and be okay about that,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.400]   which is perfectly fine advice,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.880]   but is not in itself, I think,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.760]   a fully fledged solution to this issue of burnout.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.960]   Now, we get this advice from many different angles.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.480]   Some of those books I talked about before
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.520]   come at this from an economic materialist standpoint.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.840]   They say, well, you're doing a lot of things
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.480]   because essentially you're being exploited
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.120]   by the capitalist superstructure,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.640]   and so it's an act of political resistance
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.600]   to not do something,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.960]   do nothing as an act of political resistance.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.480]   Some of these books are more cultural.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   Just we have a culture of overproduction.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.120]   Maybe it goes back to the Protestant work ethic or whatever,
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.960]   and we just need to defy that culture.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.840]   It's an arbitrary culture.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.000]   We should just do less things.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.220]   Nothing wrong with that advice.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.640]   I just don't think it's enough by itself
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.360]   to actually cure what ails us
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.000]   because we do like to do things.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.880]   There's nothing that makes us more consistently miserable
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.140]   as a species than actually doing nothing
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.760]   for any extended period of time.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.120]   That makes us very uncomfortable.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.000]   It makes us feel non-efficacious.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.840]   It makes us feel rootless and bored and anxious.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.840]   We'd like to do things.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.200]   The problem is not activity.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.700]   The problem is too much activity.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.080]   So we need a more sophisticated solution
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.480]   than simply saying it's okay to not do as many things,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.320]   just do less.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.080]   That maybe is a step in the right direction,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.240]   but we need to take many steps more.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.500]   This is what brings me to my recent thinking
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.880]   on this emerging concept of slow productivity.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.760]   Slow productivity is meant as a response to this question
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.120]   of what should we do in the face of being exhausted
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.560]   by all that we have to do.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.600]   So to look into this topic of slow productivity,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.880]   I started by trying to understand
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.740]   what was productivity for our ancient ancestors?
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.640]   In other words, as human beings,
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.520]   what is natural when it comes to activity?
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   It is a basic question,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.780]   but we need an answer to this question of what is natural
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.040]   if we're gonna try to get back to something
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.520]   that's more attuned to the human condition.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.360]   And so I went back and did some work
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.540]   trying to understand the rhythms of activity
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.320]   of our Paleolithic ancestors.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.800]   We obviously don't have direct observations about this,
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.920]   but I ended up talking to a quantitative anthropologist
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.220]   from Oxford University who is one of the world's experts
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.160]   at studying extant hunter-gatherer tribes in the Philippines
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.800]   and using robust methods to try to measure
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.880]   what their activity levels are like
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.500]   and very carefully try to make some extrapolations
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.920]   from this to our hunter-gatherer past.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.800]   That's an extrapolation you have to do carefully,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.500]   but he's sensitive and careful about that.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.820]   And here's basically what you see.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.940]   Our best guess at what activity was like
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.180]   for the bulk of our species' existence
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.180]   is you would be doing skilled and important work
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.180]   basically every day,
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.620]   mainly focused on food acquisition and preparation
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.940]   as well as child-rearing,
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.060]   but you would be,
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.580]   these extant tribes they studied,
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.700]   if you were gathering herbs,
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.580]   you had a huge expert understanding of the various plants
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.620]   and their various uses.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.460]   It's very expert work.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.540]   Or if you're hunting, hunting was a very skilled activity
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.740]   when you don't have very sophisticated weapons like rifles.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.420]   So you're doing skilled but important work
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.000]   at a natural pace.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.180]   This is definitely what they found in their work
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.040]   on these tribes is there's lots of breaks.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.580]   You might be spending all day on a hunt,
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.820]   but there's gonna be a two-hour part in the middle of the day
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.820]   where you're just resting and maybe you take,
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.860]   there's a nap over here.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.940]   It's a natural pace with ups and downs of intensity
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.700]   and never too many things at the same time.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.620]   There's no notion of I have 18 things
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.580]   I'm trying to get done as a Paleolithic hunter-gatherer
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.500]   and I'm trying to go through this list.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.740]   It's like we're doing this today and then that.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.940]   That's basically what we did throughout most of our history.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.440]   Now compare that to where we are today.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.500]   Where we are today,
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.380]   and let's focus mainly on the world of work
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.060]   just to keep this more precise.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.060]   Where we are today is maintaining list of things
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.560]   that we need to do, obligations and commitments,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.340]   some of them explicit, some of them implicit,
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.140]   that are massive.
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.580]   Massive list of obligations and commitments.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.420]   In the world of work,
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.580]   these just come flying at us through emails.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.140]   They come flying at us through quick requests
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.140]   during Zoom meetings.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.420]   Hey, Cal, can you take care of this
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.700]   or can you jump on this?
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.220]   Flying at us in informal conversations in the hallway
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.060]   where a boss grabs you and says,
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.180]   look into this, can you get this done for me?
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.020]   And we have these very large list of things
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.460]   that are on our plate.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.620]   I call this state chronic overload
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.100]   because we have more things on our plate
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.460]   than we can easily imagine how we're gonna get them done
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.060]   and this is a state that is persistent.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.380]   We constantly have this overloaded list of things
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.180]   that we have to do.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.780]   This causes three problems,
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.980]   three problems that were not faced
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.900]   by our Paleolithic ancestors.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.300]   One is just the simple short-circuiting
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.660]   of the center of our brain
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.100]   that is dedicated to making long-term plans
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   for goal completion.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.660]   Humans have a center in their brain
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.100]   that does this very well.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.700]   Even our close primate relatives
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.940]   do not have anything that's quite as powerful
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.100]   as our ability to plan and go after goals.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.060]   This is tapped into our motivational systems.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.540]   We feel good when we make a plan,
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.820]   we feel even better when we execute the plan,
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.140]   we feel bad if we don't.
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.580]   This system gets completely overloaded
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.260]   when you have 700 unread messages in your inbox
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.140]   and 75 different projects, tasks,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.580]   and ongoing commitments that you're trying to juggle.
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.580]   It is too many things for that part of your brain
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.500]   to imagine how it's going to accomplish
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.380]   and it short-circuits that planning center of our brain
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.700]   that makes us anxious, that makes us miserable.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.020]   Again, our Paleolithic ancestors
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.900]   never had 700 unread emails,
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.540]   each of which representing a commitment
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.900]   that we can't wrap our mind around
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.260]   how are we ever gonna satisfy all these commitments.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.180]   Two, when you have way more things on your plate
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.580]   than you can easily imagine handling,
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.580]   you suffer from what I think is one of the more
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.060]   insidious tortures of modern office work,
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.320]   which is the overhead spiral.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.020]   So if you give me something to do,
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.780]   here's a project, I want you to work with these two people
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.180]   and get it done.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.660]   There is a fixed amount of overhead
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.700]   that comes with this project
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.220]   because we have to kind of coordinate.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.980]   So there's gonna be, I don't know,
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.140]   some notion of number of meetings we have to do
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.100]   to talk things through and make a plan.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.020]   There'll be some non-trivial number of emails
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.760]   we have to send back and forth to get questions answered
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.020]   or to move the project forward.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.580]   In isolation, that's all fine.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.860]   If I'm working on something, yeah,
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.160]   let's meet about it once a week
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.500]   and send some emails in between.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.500]   That's fine, that's just the overhead cost
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.260]   of working with people to accomplish something, no problem.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.740]   The issue is what if we have 25 of these
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.500]   ongoing at the same time?
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.460]   Each of them has the same fixed amount of overhead.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.020]   Each one needs that weekly meeting.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.660]   Each one needs a couple dozen emails sent each week.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.700]   And it adds and adds and adds
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.820]   until your schedule becomes overloaded
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.380]   with this fixed overhead.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.100]   And now you are spending almost all of your time
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.560]   talking about the work you need to do
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.140]   with no time left to actually execute the work.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.980]   Again, I think this is the knowledge worker equivalent
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.500]   of Chinese water torture.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.660]   It is maddening, it is deranging.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.820]   We saw this really clearly amplified
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.420]   during the first half year of the coronavirus pandemic
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.920]   where office workers had to suddenly work remote.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.660]   Shifting operations remote meant
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.180]   that there was a lot of new work that got generated, right?
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.940]   Because we have to figure out
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.860]   how do we do our work if we're remote?
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.840]   So suddenly everyone's obligation list got bigger.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.360]   Each of these things brought with it
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.540]   a meeting and some emails.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.960]   What happened?
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.420]   I heard report after report from knowledge workers
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.380]   saying I am spending eight straight hours per day in Zoom.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.580]   I would get complaints from people that said
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.380]   my biggest issue is I don't know
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.340]   when to use the bathroom during the day.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.860]   I'm on Zoom that often, in Zoom,
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.420]   doing email while in Zoom the entire day.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.860]   This is a parody of work life
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.500]   where all you're doing is talking about work.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.840]   Not just I have too many meetings,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.460]   all you were doing was meetings.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.980]   That's overhead spiral personified right there.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.500]   So again, you have too many things on your plate
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.500]   that you've committed to,
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.700]   the overhead itself takes over your whole schedule.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.260]   And finally, the last issue with chronic overload
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.300]   is it's relentless in its pace.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.980]   There is never any time where you get to relax.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.740]   There's never any time you get to downshift.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.540]   Remember our Paleolithic ancestors,
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.780]   if they were doing an all day hunt,
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.700]   might have hours in there where they're just sitting around.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.300]   Yeah, it's the heat of the day.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.000]   Let's sit in the shade of a tree and just like nap and chat.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.360]   Or we hunted the last two days,
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.100]   it's kind of rainy today, not great conditions.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.580]   We're not gonna hunt today at all.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.820]   In a system of modern work with chronic overload
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.380]   where you always have way more on your plate
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.100]   than you ever can get around the handling,
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.180]   there is a constant pressure on execution.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.740]   'Cause there's always things that need to get done
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.620]   and you're always behind.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.460]   So every day you fill it, relentless.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.660]   Work every minute you have available.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.880]   Probably have to do some evenings,
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.700]   probably have to do some weekends as well
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.060]   to get around the overhead spirals.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.900]   We're not wired for this relentless pace of work
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.700]   where you never have any relief.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.820]   And it's pegged at this 10 on the scale of one to 10
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.820]   of how hard you're working day after day after day after day.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:38.060]   This I think is the more detailed
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.380]   socio physiological explanation
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.380]   for what all of those anti productivity books
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.460]   were commenting on.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.940]   This is why we're so miserable.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.260]   Chronic overload creates those three problems,
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.060]   those three problems alienate us
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.300]   from the rhythms of work for which we're wired as people.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.620]   And that is why we're not happy.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.100]   That is then what we need to solve.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.500]   How do we get rid of chronic overload?
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.700]   How do we get rid of those issues
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.300]   that come from chronic overload?
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.320]   Just saying I'm gonna do less isn't gonna cut it.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.820]   Hey boss, I've decided I don't wanna be a part
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.580]   of the exploitative capitalist engine.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.580]   So I'm not gonna work today.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.300]   Good luck, not gonna solve it.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.940]   We need a more detailed, sophisticated solution here.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.060]   It's not gonna work to say, hey client,
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.380]   I do not wanna be a stooge
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.300]   in a Protestant work ethic culture established
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.940]   during the pre-colonial period
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.740]   in the early days of migration to the United States.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.740]   So I'm not gonna answer your email.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.100]   That's not a solution.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.700]   We need something more sophisticated.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.700]   All right, slow productivity is that answer.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.340]   Slow productivity is that answer.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.860]   Let me give you three quick ideas
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.580]   for what slow productivity might mean.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.540]   Three elements to it.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.580]   This is going to evolve,
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.380]   but let's try to get something pinned down here.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.660]   So to me, there's three big things I care about
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.820]   with a slow productivity philosophy.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.500]   Doing fewer things, doing those things at a natural pace,
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.260]   obsessing over the quality of the things you do.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.100]   That definition of productivity,
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.900]   a productivity that prioritizes those three things,
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.540]   I think can get us back towards
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.260]   the rhythms of work for which we are wired
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.740]   while also fulfilling us, doing interesting work,
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.220]   letting our companies grow,
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.140]   helping our team succeed, getting promotion still,
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.940]   getting the autonomy that comes from getting good
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.860]   at things that are rare and valuable,
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.020]   that is compatible with that.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.140]   So let me just touch on those three things real quickly.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.860]   Do fewer things.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.940]   I think your workload in an ideal world
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.300]   would be below that level of chronic overload.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.220]   You have few enough things that you are committed
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.140]   to doing on your plate that you are not suffering
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.980]   from the short circuiting of your planning circuit.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.100]   You're not suffering from overhead spirals,
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.700]   and you do not feel like you have no option
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.740]   but to have a relentless pace
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.340]   where you're feeling every minute of your day.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.660]   We need to do many fewer things.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.500]   And if you work for yourself, if you're a freelancer,
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.580]   run your own company, aggressively titrate
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.660]   how many things you take on at the same time.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.180]   You are not a computer processor
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.060]   where you want your pipeline of instructions
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.100]   to execute to be full,
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.660]   so you never miss a particular tick.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.380]   You're a human.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.660]   You're not wired to do that.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.340]   We need to do many fewer things.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.620]   What if you work for someone else?
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.700]   Well, I think we need to completely rethink
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.180]   how work is assigned in the workplace.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.740]   This should be transparent.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.180]   How much work is this person doing?
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.820]   What's on their plate?
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.380]   So that we can all see it.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.780]   And then we can have very clear understandings
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.780]   of what is reasonable.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.900]   And if I see, you know,
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.300]   Jesse has a fair number of things on his plate,
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.020]   I can't put something else on it.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.220]   It's on me to figure out.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.060]   Something pops up, it needs to get done at some point.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.940]   I can't just say, Jesse handled this.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.020]   I have to figure out where does this go
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.580]   until someone has room for it.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.060]   It can't just go on their plate.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.340]   The answer here is probably gonna be external systems.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.860]   Things that need to get done go into external systems
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.380]   where they bring with them the information
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.420]   they need to be accomplished
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.220]   and have clear statuses and priorities.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.580]   And then individuals pull work out of the system
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.940]   as new slots open.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.100]   This might sound like it's a pain.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.820]   I don't care if it's a pain.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.060]   It's what we're wired to do.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.980]   Keep my load reasonable.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.020]   And I'll pull in new stuff
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.340]   when I'm done with what's on my plate.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.980]   Don't just give it all to me and say, figure it out.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.060]   You're gonna short circuit my brain.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.700]   You're gonna make me miserable.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.220]   All right, second piece of slow productivity,
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.380]   work at a natural pace.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.860]   We cannot just peg our efforts at a 10
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.300]   for eight to nine hours a day,
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.460]   day after day, week after week, week after week.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.220]   This is not natural for humans.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.220]   We need seasonality in our work, first of all.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.380]   Seasonality meaning hard times balanced by easier times.
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.760]   And I think we should have this at all scales.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.300]   So this week, some days are harder than others.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.980]   I'm gonna pull back on Friday
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.140]   and come into the weekend maybe a little bit more relaxed,
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.440]   but Monday I'm pegging it.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.360]   We should have certain months, perhaps,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.200]   that are more intense than others.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.360]   This is an intense month.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.840]   We're kind of getting after it, but you know what?
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.320]   In June, things really get quiet around here
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.280]   and I'm pulling back
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.960]   and I'm gonna have very light days, right?
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.160]   So seasonality at different levels,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.580]   maybe even seasons like professors do.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.880]   Winter, I'm getting after it.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.820]   Summer, I'm pulled back far.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.340]   Rest, recovery, up, down, up, down at all scales.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.640]   I think we absolutely need this.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.300]   The other thing we have to do to get a more natural pace
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.540]   to our work is adjust the time scale
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.440]   at which we care about accomplishment.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.220]   Instead of caring about how much do I get done
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.520]   on the scale of days and weeks,
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.280]   you say, "I worry about what I get done
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.880]   "on the scale of months and years."
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.400]   Completely changes your relationship to the current moment.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.020]   When you wanna produce a good number
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.740]   of very high quality thing over the next three years,
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.080]   it really changes how you feel about Tuesday.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.460]   Now it's not so important that every minute of Tuesday
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.500]   you're getting after it.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.340]   In fact, you might say,
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.540]   "I need to take a couple of weeks off here
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.940]   "so that I can really have a high quality push
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:14.900]   "for the weeks that follow."
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.880]   It completely changes your relationship to work
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.220]   when you say, "I don't care about how many things
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.380]   "I check off a list this week.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.780]   "What I care about is what is on my CV
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.260]   "that I produced over the last five years."
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.500]   That's much more compatible with seasonality ups and downs.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.500]   The final point here,
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.360]   the final part of slow productivity I mentioned
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.620]   was obsess about quality.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.880]   If you're gonna do less,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.440]   you need to pair that with doing what you do better.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.160]   This will make the work more fulfilling
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.400]   because you're building and applying craft.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.080]   Remember our example of our Paleolithic ancestors,
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.600]   skilled, important activity.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.680]   We get motivation for that.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.260]   We don't get motivation for adjusting the fonts
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.120]   in a PowerPoint deck,
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.120]   for fundraising for some company idea
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.640]   we probably shouldn't be doing in the first place
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.560]   just because we're bored.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.920]   But crafting the computer program that's gonna run
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.000]   and do something really cool,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.040]   and you can see it producing the book,
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.560]   the brilliant new marketing campaign.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.840]   So we wanna focus on doing smaller number of things,
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.300]   but doing those things much better
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.740]   is gonna feel more fulfilling.
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.860]   It is also what is going to give you
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.180]   both the ability and the courage to say no to other things.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.680]   When your main metric becomes,
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.560]   "How do I do what I do better?"
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.500]   Now it's easy to say,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.500]   "I'm not gonna do this middling thing.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.320]   "I'm not gonna do this distraction.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.260]   "I'm not gonna jump on this call.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.820]   "I'm not gonna learn this new plugin
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.580]   "that maybe will bring me some new email subscribers
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.760]   "for my news list."
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.160]   'Cause that's not gonna help me get better
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.660]   at what I'm trying to do.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.720]   It is much, much easier to be minimalist
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.120]   in your scheduling when you're focused relentlessly
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.260]   on a small number of things
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.600]   getting better and better at it.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.980]   It also earns you the right to be more autonomous.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.080]   The better you get at what you do best,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.640]   the more leeway you have to say,
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.980]   "I'm not coming onto that committee.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.260]   "I am not going to do this client contract.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.940]   "It's barely overlaps.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.460]   "What I like to do is gonna be incredibly time consuming.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.940]   "I'm not gonna have to do 25 social media posts a day
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.260]   "in some quixotic quest
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.220]   "to build up an influencer audience."
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.420]   It gives you the autonomy you need
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.460]   to take control over what you spend your time on
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.420]   and what you don't.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.180]   So that is my answer.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.600]   That is my answer to the anti-productivity movement.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.060]   Yes, we are overloaded.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.180]   It's a problem.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.540]   Why?
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.860]   Because of chronic overload.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.900]   Causes all these issues
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.500]   that alienates us from our human wiring.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.340]   What's the solution?
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.780]   Not that discard productivity and say, "Do less
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.560]   "and let's celebrate that."
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.900]   But to get more specific and say,
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.600]   "Let's redefine productivity."
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.260]   We'll call it slow productivity.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.220]   And we're gonna build this very intentionally
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.620]   from the ground up to get our work lives
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.480]   back aligned with our ancient wiring.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.360]   Do fewer things.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.680]   Do this work at a natural pace.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   Obsess over quality.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.760]   That I believe is the proper response
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.520]   to our current, rightly pointed out
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.600]   as problematic state of overload.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.400]   That is how we take back control of activity in our life
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.840]   and keep it fulfilling, keep it meaningful,
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.160]   keep options open, but also get away
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.200]   from all of the issues we're currently facing
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.760]   in our world of chronic overload.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.560]   All right, so that's what I have on slow productivity.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.480]   This is a new thought guys.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.160]   So I'm sure it's gonna evolve.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.240]   Jesse, you've heard me talk about this a few times now.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.080]   Would you say you're slow?
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.900]   - Yeah, I've heard you.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.920]   I listened to you talk about it
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.160]   on the Ferris interview yesterday.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.000]   - That's right, yeah.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   So the day before this came out
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.520]   or a couple of days before my interview
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.960]   with Tim Ferris came out
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.920]   and slow productivity was one of the topics
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.080]   that we got into.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.600]   I've also written about slow productivity
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.920]   for the New Yorker.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.720]   So my last of my office-based columns for them,
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.600]   which came out in early January, was on slow productivity.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.720]   And I may or may not be working on a book proposal
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.560]   on the topic.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.520]   So you might be wondering why I'm talking about it.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.760]   I mean, ironically for a book on slow productivity,
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.440]   it can't come out fast.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.760]   I think that's the problem.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.260]   It was like, guys, I stayed up every night for two months
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.000]   and got this book done by just relentlessly working
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.040]   as fast as possible.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.540]   I think that's not gonna work.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:35.040]   - Yeah, you talked about this in the past too
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.520]   in previous podcast episodes where you said
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.920]   you were gonna kind of walk us through the process
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.160]   of writing the book and stuff.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.560]   So I'm looking forward to that.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.360]   It's actually already started.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.640]   - Yeah, so maybe there's some breaking news here.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.680]   So in past podcast episodes,
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.440]   we were talking about a book I'm working on a proposal on
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.500]   for the deep life.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   This would be a second book.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.600]   So I might be, I'm working on potentially the deep life
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.480]   and slow productivity in some order
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.720]   might be the next two books I write.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.640]   None of that is inked.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.720]   None of that's actually written down or signed
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.920]   or none of it's official,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.120]   but that's what I'm currently thinking
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.040]   is those might be the next two books I write.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.000]   - And that's what you did before the last two books, right?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.440]   You worked on them simultaneously.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.280]   - Yeah, I like doing that 'cause I wanna just work.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.440]   I wanna think deeply and write.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.560]   And so I sold digital minimalism in a world without email.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.940]   I sold those at the same time.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.580]   And then that allowed me to just not worry
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.000]   about selling books for four or five years.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.920]   I could just write.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.300]   And when I was done with one book,
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.840]   I knew what I was working on.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.960]   I mean, I'm gonna put my head down and write type of guy.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.480]   That makes me happy.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.660]   Having to go out and talk about the books,
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.420]   okay, that's harder for me.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.960]   I like the part where it's just me, me and the idea.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.320]   I guess me and the idea and Jesse
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.000]   and tens of thousands of podcast listeners, but that's it.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.460]   Just our small circle talking about these things.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.720]   So I like that.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.280]   I like to sell multiple books at a time if I can.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.920]   'Cause I don't wanna spend, it's a pain to sell books, man.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.640]   And it's stressful and it's complicated.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.360]   And there's a ton of fiddling overhead on it too.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.000]   I mean, these proposals are 50 pages long.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.840]   It just takes a long time to write, but it's not fun writing.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.880]   It's not, oh, I'm writing about ideas.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.120]   It's, you're writing about your marketing plan
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.960]   and stuff like that.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.760]   So I try not to do it more than I need to.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.520]   - One thing you mentioned in the Ferris interview
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.160]   was he started off with your relationship
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.800]   or your Steve Martin, he was asking about him.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   And then you were talking about his autobiography.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.240]   I listened to the audio book recently.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.880]   And at the end, he had the quote where he was in,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.720]   I think it was in "The Jerk"
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.920]   when he was like leaving the house.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.320]   It was like, I just need this and I need this one thing.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.600]   And he needed all those things.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.440]   It kind of reminds me of what you just said.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.840]   - Yeah, he just had this and then just this
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.200]   and just a little bit of that.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.460]   And then just this and yeah.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.640]   Good book, "Born Standing Up."
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.680]   Yeah, I recommend it.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.920]   We should probably pay the bills.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.320]   Talk about some of the sponsors of the show
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.240]   that makes this possible.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.960]   We are happy to have them.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.360]   You know, it's not cheap to do a podcast.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.240]   We have, for example, the cost of the podcast hosting.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.480]   We have Jesse's $250,000 a month salary,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.960]   which, you know, it's not easy.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.340]   So there's a lot we have to pay for to get this going.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.240]   So Jesse, let me tell you,
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.560]   one of our first sponsors here is Policy Genius.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.840]   So Policy Genius deals with
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.440]   home and auto insurance coverage, right?
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.000]   Which is expensive and potentially something
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.480]   that you're paying way too much for.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.080]   But a lot of people will just put up with paying too much
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.560]   for this type of insurance because they say,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.920]   well, I don't know, it's a pain to try to figure out
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.120]   if there's a cheaper way of doing this.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.520]   When am I going to go Google insurance prices or something?
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.080]   This is where Policy Genius comes in.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.440]   So it's a one-stop shop to find
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.800]   and buy the insurance you need.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.200]   You go to policygenius.com and they make it easy.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.840]   So you answer a few questions and they say,
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.880]   here are some price estimates, right?
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.720]   There's a number.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.500]   You can compare it right away
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.080]   to what you're currently paying.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.480]   It will also look for clever ways for you to save money.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.520]   Right, so maybe how to bundle home and auto
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.760]   in a way that's going to save you more money.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.720]   They have saved customers an average of $1,250 per year
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.880]   over what they were paying for home and auto insurance
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.320]   before they went to Policy Genius.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.860]   So Policy Genius is a, not an insurance company,
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.040]   but a broker that helps you find the insurance companies
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.740]   that are going to give you the best price.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.720]   This is something you can do quickly.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.080]   You go to this website, they make it easy,
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.800]   and suddenly you are saving potentially a lot of money.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.720]   Now, Jesse, I think if we went to policygenius.com
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.560]   and showed them a picture of your truck you drive,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.000]   they would just say, uninsurable.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.360]   - My insurance is pretty cheap.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.600]   I actually, you know, but I've had it for a long time.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.440]   - Yeah, Jesse drives the truck from,
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.560]   like if you watch the show Yellowstone
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.840]   about those ranches in Montana,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.120]   and they sometimes do flashbacks from like the 1970s.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.320]   It's like the truck they're driving in 1970.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.140]   Do I have that about right?
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.520]   It's like a 1970s old school pickup truck.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.000]   - It's funny too, because every mechanic's like,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.200]   I tell them how many miles on it, I'm like 185,000.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.720]   Like, oh man, you got so much more time.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.240]   Like so much more time.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.080]   - There we go.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.920]   But so here we go.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.520]   So now Jesse could go to, you know, policygenius.com
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.760]   and find out right away,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.760]   maybe he's spending way too much of his $250,000 a month
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.720]   salary on the insurance.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   And that's what makes this website great,
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.560]   is that it's easy.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   It's insurance overpayment is a first mile problem.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.360]   How do I get started trying to find something cheaper?
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.560]   Policy Genius makes that easier.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.080]   No extra fees.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.680]   They don't sell your information to third parties.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.080]   They've helped over 30 million people shop for insurance
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.800]   and has placed over $120 billion in cover
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.320]   so they know what they're doing.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.120]   So head to policygenius.com
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   to get your free home and auto insurance quotes
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.100]   and see how much you could save.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.960]   All right, so we have another sponsor I wanna talk about,
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.800]   which is Synerd.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.120]   Now I realize Synerd,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.360]   it's not always obvious how to spell what I'm saying here.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.400]   So let me actually spell it out.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.200]   Synerd, C-E-N-T-E-R-E-D.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.760]   So putting something into the Synerd.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.000]   Jesse, I'm excited about this one.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.240]   This is right up my alley.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.280]   This is a computer software
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.320]   that helps you block out distractions and work deeper.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.240]   So, I mean, this is music to my ears.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.840]   It's an app that you can run on a Mac.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.320]   You can also run it on a Windows
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.960]   and it has multiple different things
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.120]   that all come together
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.000]   that help you actually work deeper.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.880]   It can pull all of your tasks into one place.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.600]   It can play focus music.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.160]   I talked to the founder of this company actually,
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.080]   and he said, "That's surprisingly popular,
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.280]   "the playing just the right music to help you focus."
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.880]   I told him, "I think it's not just the details
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.200]   "of the specific music you're playing,
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.880]   "but it's the fact that the users build up an association.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.960]   "That music is time to do deep work,
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.760]   "so you get there quicker."
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.520]   They have a virtual coach.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.480]   Jesse's gonna put me out of business.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.960]   They have a virtual coach who has an English
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.120]   or can be configured to have an English accent.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.120]   And this is actually a popular feature on this app.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.640]   It nudges you very nicely of,
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.880]   "You know, I don't know that you need to be on Facebook
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   "for another hour.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.080]   "Maybe you need to get back."
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.160]   And again, the users of Centered
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.680]   find that to be really effective.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.880]   You know, that's gonna break our plan, Jesse,
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.720]   our money-making plan,
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.520]   where you just hire me to sit over your shoulder as you work.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.320]   - Well, if you get a better English accent,
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.200]   then maybe, you know, get back in the game.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.040]   - The way I do it is I have,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.880]   I would want my coach to sound like Jocko Willink
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.520]   and to basically berate me.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.480]   Just like, "Get up at 4.30."
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.600]   "Why are you still in bed, you wuss?
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.960]   "Get focused."
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.560]   Yeah, now Centered has this better figured out.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.240]   They also have analytics.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.320]   They come back, "Here's what you're doing.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.800]   "Here's how you're actually spending your time."
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.120]   That's incredibly, incredibly effective.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.240]   They've done some research.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.400]   So Centered research has showed that their users
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.280]   are getting through their important tasks
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.040]   30% faster than they expected.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.000]   So we know that it has effects.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.880]   As I mentioned before, simple task management,
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.000]   100 hours of this custom flow music,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.520]   the automated coaching to encourage you.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.640]   If you're not using Centered with their automated coaching,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.600]   I'm sending Jocko to your house to berate you.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   So let that be motivation.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.960]   A great do not disturb mode.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   I didn't mention that before,
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.760]   but if you wanna just lock in so I can't be interrupted,
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.400]   they have a great do not disturb mode.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.120]   Anyways, I love this type of space.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.080]   I think for too long, productivity software
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.000]   was just about how do we get people
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.440]   quicker access to information and make communication faster.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.080]   That's what productivity has meant.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.160]   And I think what productivity software should mean
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.200]   is what Centered is doing,
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   which is how do we actually make the computer
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.280]   in which you're interacting better match
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.680]   the wiring of your brain as a human
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.640]   so you get better work done in a way that's more sustainable.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.680]   So you can download Centered today
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   at centered.app/deepquestions.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:41.000]   And use that promo code, deepquestions, one word,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.520]   and you will get a free month of Centered,
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.600]   including all of its premium features.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.520]   So that's centered.app/deepquestions.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.480]   Good, I'm glad that app exists, Jesse, because-
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.680]   - Yeah, free month is pretty good.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.880]   - Yeah, it would be pretty busy for me
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.960]   if I had to actually just go around
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.400]   and look over people's shoulders and yell at them.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.480]   I don't think that scales.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.600]   I think they have a more scalable model.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.680]   Would be my guess there.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.640]   All right, we should probably do some questions.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:14.040]   As always, let us start with some questions about Deep Work.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.200]   Well, we've got a healthy start to this podcast here.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.560]   We're 35 minutes in.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.600]   - Yeah, so barkedivity in the ads were good stuff.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.360]   - Yeah, well, look, now that we have
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.800]   standalone versions of these questions,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.840]   I'm gonna be nice and pithy here,
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.520]   which means I'm about to spend 25 minutes
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.600]   on the first question.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   Well, John, it's a good question.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.920]   Let's start with our Paleolithic ancestors
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.520]   and then go into the neuroscience
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.880]   of how our brain is wired.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.600]   And then I wanna talk about the development
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.880]   of Enlightenment philosophy and their take on this.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.280]   No, no, pithy.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.400]   All right, our first question here comes from John.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.560]   John asks, "What does your general knowledge management
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.040]   system look like these days?
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.520]   Do you have a system like Second Brain
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.680]   or software tools like Notion or Roam?
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.720]   My biggest challenge is finding interesting papers
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.120]   or information relevant to my field,
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.600]   but having an effortless way to retrieve the information
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.040]   at the right time and place."
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.800]   Well, John, we talk about this a lot these days.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.400]   I get yelled at a lot by Zettelkasten people
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.520]   for being, I guess, insufficiently enthusiastic,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.960]   but here's my quick answer.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.720]   I use Roam for most of my knowledge management these days,
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.760]   which I enjoy because I think it gives me more flexibility
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.800]   in storing and linking information
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.600]   than having to be in strict hierarchies of folders
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.280]   and subfolders and subfolders,
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.560]   and I'm getting better at it.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.400]   Two, I think effortlessness is largely a myth.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:46.080]   Okay, I like having a better place to store information.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.000]   It makes an epsilon difference, right?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.360]   It might make things 20% easier to find something.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.440]   It might generate the occasional extra idea,
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.920]   but as I always say when I talk
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.040]   about knowledge management systems is I just think
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.040]   for a lot of high-end work, effortlessness is a myth.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.560]   Like here's the reality, for example,
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.400]   of let's say article writing,
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.080]   like working on an article like I am right now
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.640]   for "The New Yorker."
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.320]   It is true that having an interesting system
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.440]   where you encounter lots of things and they're stored
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.000]   might help spark an idea.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.840]   You know, I saw this interesting article
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.080]   and it got into my system,
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.000]   and I saw another article two months later,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.520]   and the comparison between those two,
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.480]   the contrast between those two gives me a spark
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.120]   of an idea that could be an article.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.560]   So it can provide a spark, but then what has to happen?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.920]   It is probably gonna be focused,
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.720]   intentional research to say,
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.840]   okay, now I wanna write this article.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.320]   I'm not gonna just effortlessly find in my system
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.760]   everything I need.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.080]   I'm gonna have to, in a much more systematic manner,
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.560]   go out there and do old-school research,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.560]   pull articles, do interviews, endless Google searching,
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.560]   get this all into Scrivener somewhere
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.960]   and start staring at it,
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.680]   realize I have a whole of my knowledge,
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.200]   go out there and find new information.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.640]   So I don't really think there's a way to avoid
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.560]   in a lot of idea generative type work,
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.960]   I don't think there's a lot of way to avoid
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.960]   having to do focused information acquisition
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.280]   for the project you're working on.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.560]   No matter how much stuff you have stored in your system,
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.360]   there's 50 more articles you're gonna have to read
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.760]   before you can actually say something smart about the idea.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.440]   So anyways, I like these type of Zettelkasten inspired
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.360]   link-based storage systems
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.560]   as a reasonable way to categorize information.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.560]   I just don't place as much expectations
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.660]   on what the system's gonna provide for me.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.440]   That wasn't too bad.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.080]   Three minutes, feel good about that.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.280]   All right, we have a question here from Raquel.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.320]   Raquel, sorry Raquel.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.960]   Raquel asks, do you carry or keep two analog pieces
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.800]   on your desk, one being your time block planner
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.840]   and another for notes or just your planner?
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:00.920]   So Raquel, my two always around processed
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:06.880]   during every shutdown ritual every day capture tools
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.000]   is my time block planner,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.440]   which has for every day space for notes and tasks
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.680]   that I can write down.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.560]   And that's where my checkbox is that I have to check
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.840]   when I do my shutdown routine at the end of each day.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.440]   So I know that's all gonna be processed.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.440]   The second tool I always have is my working memory.txt
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.620]   plain text file on my computer desktop.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.160]   I'm gonna say on my computer desktop,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.880]   I have multiple computers, they each have one.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.560]   But my main computer I use on a normal workday
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.800]   would be my laptop and I have it right there.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.960]   So I always have my paper notebook,
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.200]   I can capture things on it,
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.520]   especially if I'm away from my computer.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.160]   And then I have that working memory.txt,
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.760]   which collects a lot of information during the day,
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.900]   especially when I'm doing stuff on my computer
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.360]   and a lot of information pops up.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.080]   Imagine for example, you're in a Zoom meeting
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.440]   and there's some notes you have to think about
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.940]   and six tasks that come out of that meeting.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.920]   I'm just typing that right into my working memory.txt
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.800]   right there on my computer.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.640]   I can type much faster than I can write.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.220]   I can put voluminous notes into there.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.680]   Don't overthink it, don't make it too pretty,
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.400]   just boom, boom, boom.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.520]   End of the day when I do my shutdown routine,
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.640]   I look at the time block planner, what's in there,
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.240]   everything get put into my permanent systems,
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   I look at working memory.txt.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.400]   Let's take care of everything that's in there.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.160]   Right, so that's the regular things I use.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.160]   I then will introduce project specific analog notebooks.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.100]   So if I'm working on a particular
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.440]   computer science research paper,
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.000]   I might have a grid notebook.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.420]   I like grid line notebooks for doing mathematics
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.720]   that I'm just bringing with me to work on that project.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.920]   If I'm working on a new book,
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.080]   I might get a Moleskine notebook dedicated to that book,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.320]   just to put ideas in there as I have them,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.160]   collect inspiration when I'm away from a computer, et cetera.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.800]   And those I will use and process in a way
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.640]   that is bespoke to their corresponding project.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.840]   So when it comes time to work on that academic paper again,
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.520]   hey, here's my notebook for that particular paper.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.040]   Let me see what I had in there.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.400]   And that's where I'm storing it.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.120]   So I have two permanent collection mechanisms,
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.980]   one analog, one digital.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.120]   And then I will, when useful,
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.340]   have these project specific notebooks.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.200]   - What about the pocket size Moleskine
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.800]   that you carry around?
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   - Yeah, okay, so that, it's a good question.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.560]   So I also have a pocket size Moleskine
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.560]   that I use basically for reflections on the deep life.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.720]   I didn't have that terminology
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.700]   when I first started using this.
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.600]   I first started this method in 2004.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.520]   And I used to post pictures on my newsletter
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.600]   of the growing stack of the old Moleskines.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.560]   And so that's not, the reason why I didn't mention it here
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.120]   is that that's not work related.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.480]   But I'm, Justin, I'm glad you brought it up
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.640]   because it's important.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.040]   When I have reflections about my life,
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.520]   intimations about this thing I just saw or read resonated,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.720]   reflections, this has been a tough two weeks.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.600]   Why, what's going on here?
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   What can I learn about what's making me miserable
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.040]   and I might want to avoid?
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.420]   Ideas about what if we rethought
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.800]   this part of our working life?
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.520]   What if in my constitution bucket
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.800]   I rethought how exercise was in my life?
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.100]   So everything related to living the deep life.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.100]   When I have ideas, inspirations, and reflections,
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.560]   I carry with me also in my bag
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.360]   an old school pocket size Moleskine.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.480]   Why that particular notebook?
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.680]   It's because it's what I bought at the MIT co-op
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.720]   the first week I was on campus at MIT as a grad student.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.980]   And that's when I started this habit.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.440]   So for me, it is the comfort of,
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.280]   that's what I've always used.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.960]   You can use whatever notebook you want.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.040]   That I look at when I'm doing updates
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.740]   to my semester quarterly plan.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.360]   So there, if I'm thinking through,
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.800]   okay guys, let's check in.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.960]   What are we working on for the next semester?
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.360]   That's where, because when you work on those,
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.320]   you look at your values and you typically have a vision
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.600]   at the top of each of these documents
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.920]   about where you want to be.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.880]   Great time to look at those, look at those Moleskines.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   The only other tip I'll give you
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.080]   about that Moleskine method is
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.640]   what do you do when you fill it?
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.600]   My rule is anything you, you go through it
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.640]   and say, is there anything in here
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.320]   that I want to remember and I haven't done something with?
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.020]   Like it didn't change my strategic plan or something,
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.920]   but I don't want to forget it.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.120]   It's a good idea.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.100]   You copy that into the next notebook.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.480]   And what, what tends to happen is
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.680]   only a very small amount of these ideas
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.720]   actually will end up meriting being copied
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.560]   into the next notebook.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.000]   By the time you get to the notebook, the next notebook,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.600]   only a very small number of ideas will pass
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.120]   from that one to the next one.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.460]   And so it's a way of making sure things aren't lost,
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.640]   but it also helps you purify.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.880]   Like what's the idea that I've carried with me
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.180]   through four or five notebooks?
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.500]   Okay, that's a signal that maybe I really need
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.680]   to make a change around that or I need to listen to it.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   So yeah, so that's a good caveat.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   So I do have that, that Moleskine as well,
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.440]   non-work related, but critical to my pursuit
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.220]   of the deep life.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:08.480]   All right, we got a question here from Candice.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.240]   Candice says, do you have any tips
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.840]   for how to apply the deep work approach
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.160]   to job seeking for a first job?
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.160]   I'm feeling overwhelmed with all the options out there,
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.880]   and I don't know what metrics actually reflect
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.300]   the efficiency of my search.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.260]   All right, well, Candice, you're,
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.260]   you're over-defining the word deep work.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.520]   This is a common theme on the show
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.960]   that people will expand the term deep work
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.320]   to capture all sorts of different things.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.480]   But let's keep it really focused.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.760]   Deep work means I'm working on something difficult
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.260]   without distraction, so I'm not context shifting,
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.420]   and giving it my full attention.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.520]   And the whole idea behind deep work is
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.440]   that is the most effective cognitive state
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.800]   to produce non-trivial or valuable work,
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.080]   is giving something your full attention
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.420]   and not context shifting.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.400]   That really has nothing to do with organizing a job search.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.340]   What I think what you mean here is how do I do this
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:11.100]   in a way that is deep in the more general sense,
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.700]   meaning focusing on what matters,
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.920]   giving that intense intention,
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.000]   and not wasting your time with things that don't.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.400]   That general application of deep,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.840]   I think is quite appropriate here.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.600]   What I'm gonna recommend is what years ago,
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:28.400]   I'm talking 2007, when I was blogging
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.040]   mainly at a student audience.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.280]   And I'd introduced this notion called the textbook method
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:38.560]   where when you're trying to master something complicated
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.280]   and non-trivial, you should approach the challenge
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.820]   like you're writing a book about it.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.440]   Let me go gather information about this,
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.240]   organize my thoughts, and actually write it out
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.320]   like a little book.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.580]   Do that about your job search.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.040]   I wanna write a book on, in your case,
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.680]   it's biomedical engineering,
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.800]   on how to get your first job in biomedical engineering.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.360]   Won't be a long book, but something I feel good about.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.160]   Well, how am I gonna write this book?
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.040]   Well, I better go learn about how do you succeed
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.640]   in doing your first job search in biomedical engineering.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.760]   Well, how do I do that?
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.620]   I guess I should go talk to people.
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.240]   Let me talk to the seniors from last year
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.800]   who were in my program and got good jobs.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.120]   Let me talk to three of them
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.820]   and walk them through their job process
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.040]   and then have them reflect what mattered and what didn't.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.500]   If they had to do it again, what would they focus on?
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.020]   Why don't I go to the career services center
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:32.460]   at my university and talk through job searching for this.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.460]   Let me go to a career fair,
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.460]   maybe talk to one of the reps from one of these firms
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.620]   and say, let me ask you, when you're hiring,
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.700]   how's this work on the other end?
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.540]   What matters?
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.460]   What are you looking for?
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.620]   Get the real information and organize it and write it down.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:45.520]   Not a full-length book,
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.940]   but like you're putting together a pamphlet
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.820]   that's evidence-based on here's the right way
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.280]   to job search in my field to get a first job
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.580]   and then go execute that.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:58.140]   And that's almost always the key to taking this
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:01.120]   general deep approach to things in your life.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.540]   If you want to focus your energy intensely on what matters,
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.860]   not waste time on things that don't,
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.860]   you got to know what matters and that requires evidence.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.980]   And keep in mind, reality is often
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.040]   not what you want it to be.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.480]   If you say, I'm just going to make up
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.740]   what I want to matter for job searching,
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.340]   you will come up with something that you like.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.980]   It's hard, but not too hard, doesn't, you know, whatever,
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.900]   but it might not have any connection to the real world
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.780]   and what really matters.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.540]   So I really like this deep approach to almost anything,
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.180]   but it requires an evidence-based approach.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.580]   So that's my advice, Candace.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.420]   Basically go do the research to write a book
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.580]   on how to do biomedical job searching
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.380]   and then execute that plan.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:41.420]   That's how you're going to be confident
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.940]   that you're doing the right thing.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:47.140]   All right, let's see here.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.980]   We got a question from Mark.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.020]   Mark, who describes himself as from Utah,
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.680]   the gateway to Colorado.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:48:01.060]   Jesse, is that like Utah, self-hating Utah?
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.740]   What is that like self-deprecation?
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.580]   Is there like a--
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.420]   - I couldn't tell.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.580]   I was thinking maybe he goes to Colorado a lot.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.300]   I mean, maybe he drives.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.820]   - This is like a pro Colorado partisan, anti-Utah guy.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.980]   All right, so here's what he asks.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.980]   "What are you learning from people who apply your work?
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.940]   "You have to be hearing good things from people
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.960]   "who are reading and applying the principles in deep work.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.840]   "I'd love to hear them.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.980]   "Also, what are the important things
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:30.060]   "that you can learn from your book
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:35.060]   "that you wish your fans/cultist could learn?"
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.620]   Well, the only place I have cultish followers,
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.580]   I think is in that Utah.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.420]   'Cause they just really, they really suck.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.660]   Here's what I always say, and Jesse knows this.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.360]   If only Utah could just be more like Colorado.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.860]   Then what I'm doing here, Jesse,
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.520]   is I'm pandering to this question asker.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.340]   Okay, so what have people learned from deep work
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.380]   and what did they not learn?
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.660]   Did I wish they, what have I learned about the book?
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.500]   It's a good question.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.020]   Well, Jesse, you do some deep work.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:06.860]   What have you learned?
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.500]   What's your real-world experience with trying to be deeper?
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.020]   - I think it goes hand-in-hand
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.380]   with all the podcast episodes
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.560]   that you put out in the other books.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.520]   I mean, working on stuff without distraction.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.400]   You get a lot more done.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.460]   Essentially, closing down your email.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.120]   - Yeah.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.700]   - Not checking that all the time.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.940]   You know, just having certain times where you check that.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.400]   - I would say that's pretty consistent.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.200]   People will say, however I do it,
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   when I'm able to be more sequential
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.460]   and when I do hard things,
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.200]   just do the hard thing without context switching
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.080]   until I'm done.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.080]   You hear this a lot.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.920]   They say, I get so much more done.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.040]   I would say that's pretty consistent.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.960]   - Your face the dragon motto is really solid too.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.360]   Like that hit home with me.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.860]   I have it on my board at home, so I see it.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.440]   - Yeah, and that's relevant, right?
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.400]   I mean, with face the dragon,
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.640]   what I'm saying is look at everything on your plate.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.640]   Like don't run away from it.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.120]   Look at everything on your plate.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.880]   And I call it the productivity dragon,
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.520]   face the productivity dragon.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.360]   And here's the thing.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.440]   If it is inconquerable,
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.940]   then you have to see it and confront it.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.060]   And for a lot of people,
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.200]   that's why I'm glad you brought it up, Jesse,
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.360]   what that leads to is they face the productivity dragons.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.000]   They've written down everything.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.160]   A lot of times what'll happen is they write down everything
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.600]   and then they try to come up with a strategy
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.000]   for how do I deal with all of this.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.840]   They start trying to build out their autopilot schedule
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.440]   and I'll work on this here and this here.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.520]   And it just doesn't work
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.820]   because it's just way too much stuff.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.520]   And what that leads them to do is to say,
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.000]   oh, I'm gonna cut out half of this stuff.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.040]   - Yeah, and then the other thing that's great
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.760]   is with your time block planner,
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.920]   you showed how if certain things go over,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.680]   you cross out your existing plan
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.260]   and just start a new one on the same day.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.120]   So there's oftentimes where I'll be doing stuff
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.060]   and run out of time.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:56.760]   And it's as slow productivity as you talk about it.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.760]   You just wait till the next day
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.120]   and then try to factor it in.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:00.960]   - I like that.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.760]   You had a plan, you were intentional,
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.440]   you've won the game.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.700]   - Yeah, I mean, there is no gold stars for,
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.040]   wow, you came up with a time block plan
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.000]   and you hit it exactly.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.580]   Or you came up with a weekly plan or even worse,
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.000]   a quarterly plan about how this thing was gonna unfold
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.800]   and you hit it exactly.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:25.000]   No one comes along and says, great, you get extra money,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.840]   you get extra sales for your book,
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.800]   you get gold bars or something like that.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.640]   It doesn't matter.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.800]   What matters is, are you being intentional with your time?
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.720]   Because who cares if you get it right or not,
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:40.920]   is all that tells you is it's a little bit of luck
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.860]   and how good are you at guessing how long something takes?
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.720]   But in the end, it's gonna take however long it takes.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.160]   And so the key thing is that you're working on something
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.040]   consistently and with intention until it's done
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.960]   and it gets done well,
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.720]   whether you guessed properly how long that was gonna take
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.160]   or not is not that important.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.120]   - The automation stuff and finding different environments
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.360]   for different work is awesome.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.680]   Like I'm taking Spanish lessons right now,
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.300]   so I know like certain days I'm gonna do my homework,
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.680]   you know, in different spot.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.520]   - All right.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.080]   - And it's just, you know, done.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:15.920]   - All right, so good.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.320]   So we have three things so far about applying deep work
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.000]   in the real world, what people have learned.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.140]   So in particular, what Jesse has learned,
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.240]   facing a productivity dragon is important.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.820]   Intention trumps accuracy.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.420]   The key is that you have plans.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.040]   Don't beat yourself up if you don't have plans.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.640]   And then three, Jesse is saying the idea of having set times
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.520]   and places you do set work is a hack
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.160]   that really works pretty well.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:44.160]   Where's your Spanish lesson environment or ritual?
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.000]   - It depends on the day.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.560]   This Saturday, I'm gonna do it.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.040]   I'm gonna do it tomorrow morning at, you know,
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.800]   at a separate desk in my house.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.320]   And then at the same desk that I do something else.
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   - Which is a good point.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.220]   Sometimes it's minor.
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.320]   We talked about this in a recent episode.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.160]   - Yeah.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.160]   - Where we were telling someone to put a second desk
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.640]   in the same room.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   It doesn't have to be dramatic.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.360]   You don't have to fly down to Mexico every Saturday
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.640]   to do your Spanish lessons.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.380]   It's just, this is the place I go to do my Spanish lessons,
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:18.600]   even if it's a different desk in my same house.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.440]   - And then even listening to your interview
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.240]   with Ferris yesterday,
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.880]   and you were talking about going down to DC,
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.900]   going to the Botanical Garden, stuff like that.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:33.280]   I mean, that type of stuff I've factored into
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.480]   to like the way I do things,
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.480]   like going to like the local library
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.180]   or going to some other things to do,
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.840]   going to different coffee shops to do something.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.920]   And then if you do that for an hour,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.840]   it like adds up, keep on doing it.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.680]   - That's one of the,
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.180]   that's a slow productivity plug as well.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:50.640]   It's one of the things that goes in my life
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.140]   when I get near that chronic overload threshold.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.420]   Like right now I'm near that chronic overload threshold
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.740]   because I'm helping with a few university initiatives,
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.800]   which I think are very important.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.880]   So I'm doing this by choice,
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:06.100]   but it's a lot of stuff I don't typically like
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.980]   involving Zoom and PDF files, right?
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:14.020]   The overhead of that gets to the point
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.240]   where you no longer have those half days free
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.220]   or those full days free,
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:20.280]   where I would say I'm gonna go down to DC
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:23.080]   and like think about one problem for most of the day.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.040]   And that's a real slow productivity thing.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.940]   That when you, when your load is reasonable,
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:31.700]   you can do things like I'm gonna go down to a museum
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.960]   and work and then go walk through the galleries
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.920]   to get inspired and then go work some more
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.540]   and move around the city and make a whole day about it.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.200]   You can't do that anymore when you're overloaded,
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.660]   but when you can do that,
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.960]   you're gonna produce something cool at the end of that year.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.060]   When you can't do that,
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.260]   you're gonna get a lot of Zoom meetings done
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.180]   and get a lot of PDF files read.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.300]   But it's like me right now,
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.640]   month whatever of working on my book proposals,
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.820]   they're still not done,
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.380]   which what I probably need is just a couple of days
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.900]   at the botanical garden.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.660]   So yeah, it's an argument for slow productivity.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.140]   If you don't have the space to take a slow day
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.940]   to work on one project,
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.740]   you probably have too many projects.
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.420]   All right, so that's good.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.740]   So there we go.
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:15.020]   That is, there is straight from the mouth of someone
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.940]   who's working with these ideas.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.740]   These are some of the things that we have learned
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.460]   or people have learned about putting deep work
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:23.460]   into practice in the real world.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.360]   All right, I think we have time for,
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.660]   let's do one more deep work.
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.760]   Wow, we're really 55 minutes.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.160]   All right, let's do one more deep work question
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.520]   and then we'll get going with some deep life questions.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.160]   This last one comes from Walter.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.720]   Walter asked, do you think it's possible
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.340]   to push past the four hour a day limit for deep work?
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:45.060]   Yeah, Walter, it's possible.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.500]   The four hour limit comes from research
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.520]   of professional musicians.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.980]   Four hours is roughly probably a cap
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.900]   on really intense deep work,
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.180]   but most knowledge workers don't get anywhere
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.400]   near that level of intensity.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.020]   So that number came from the study of,
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.180]   I think it was professional violin players.
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.500]   You see similar numbers for professional chess players
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.380]   for what as well.
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.100]   They do a very intense training
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.220]   where they're trying to solve puzzles.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.680]   Here's a position puzzle
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.180]   and it takes really intense concentration.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.680]   There's only so much of that you can do,
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.540]   maybe around four hours.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:19.740]   Most people doing knowledge work
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.340]   are not anywhere at that level of intensity.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.940]   What's actually happening in their brains,
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.140]   they're going up and down, focusing really hard
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.620]   and relieving that pressure for a while,
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:28.660]   then focusing really hard.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:30.220]   So yes, you could spend,
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.980]   and people do spend more than four hours
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.860]   working on things deep.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.220]   The only addendum I would add is why?
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.260]   I mean, if you're spending more than four hours
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.420]   locked in on one thing,
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.940]   really trying to push yourself past
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:46.140]   where you're getting good returns,
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.020]   the question is maybe you should just slow it down.
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:51.260]   Good work day after day after day, let that break up.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.460]   So yeah, you can do it,
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.780]   but I wouldn't build a professional strategy
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:58.260]   around let me spend 10 hours a day working on one thing.
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.140]   I don't think you're gonna end up in a much better place
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.780]   than spending three hours a day,
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.500]   but working on it day after day after day,
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.020]   that's probably gonna get you to some better work.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:08.020]   And I don't know that you're gonna save time
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.740]   heroically trying to fill your day anyways,
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:11.900]   'cause that brain is gonna tire out.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.620]   All right, so that's it for Deep Work Questions.
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.580]   We have a good collection of questions for the Deep Life.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:20.740]   Before we get there,
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:24.420]   a couple other sponsors we wanna talk about
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.820]   help make this show possible.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:31.700]   The first one of those sponsors is Magic Spoon.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.100]   Now you've heard me talk about Magic Spoon
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:35.700]   quite a bit on this show.
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:38.940]   They were one of the first sponsors of this show.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:43.220]   They put out a cereal that tastes like that treat cereal
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.900]   you used to eat as a kid in the '80s or '90s,
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.700]   but without all of the junk, zero grams of sugar,
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.780]   13 to 14 grams of protein,
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:55.620]   and only four net grams of carbs in each serving.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.780]   Only 140 calories a serving as well.
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.700]   It's keto-friendly, gluten-free, grain-free,
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.500]   soy-free, and low carb.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.820]   Compare that to the cereals that we were eating
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:08.340]   in the 1980s, which I believe not only satisfied
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.540]   none of those properties,
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:12.100]   but were also 30% petroleum products.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.780]   I don't know if that's true, but I do get the sense
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:20.060]   that probably there was old tire rubber
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.100]   involved in that cereal.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.260]   So now we can eat that type of cereal that we enjoyed
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.780]   and actually have something that is healthy for us.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:28.140]   Jesse, you're a Magic Spoon guy, right?
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.860]   Unrelated to them being our sponsor.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.740]   - Yeah, I actually bought some
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.820]   because I was always a listener of your show,
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.220]   and then I bought the peanut butter kind.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.140]   It's really good.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:41.060]   - Is that your, now I hear from listeners
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:44.660]   that the expert move is to take the peanut butter Magic Spoon
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:49.060]   and mix it with the cocoa Magic Spoon, and it's Reese's.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.820]   - Yeah, that would be pretty good.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:54.140]   I could try the fruity Prebles kind too.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:54.980]   It's good.
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.380]   I mean, I've always been a huge fan of cereal,
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:57.660]   but cereal is horrible for you.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.900]   So if you can find something that's decent,
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.020]   which it was, I mean, much more healthy
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.340]   than the other cereal,
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.740]   but cereal is always kind of like my cheat,
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.060]   but now it feels better.
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.020]   - Yeah, now you can save that cheat for something else.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.060]   So anyways, it's a Magic Spoon cereal.
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:14.380]   I feel good about eating it, and also it tastes good.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.940]   So here's what we can offer for you.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:20.940]   If you go to magicspoon.com/cal,
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:25.540]   you can grab a custom bundle of Magic Spoon cereal.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:29.420]   And if you used a promo code CAL, C-A-L at checkout,
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.380]   you will save $5 off your order.
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:34.940]   Magic Spoon is so confident in their product
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.540]   that it's backed with a 100% happiness guarantee.
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:38.900]   So if you don't like it for any reason,
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.740]   they will refund your money, no questions asked,
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.020]   or you can just send your box here
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.740]   and Jesse and I will eat it for you.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:46.820]   Remember, get your next delicious bowl
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.740]   of guilt-free cereal at magicspoon.com/cal
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:55.740]   and use that code CAL to save $5 off.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:59.740]   Jesse, we should get like a kitchenette here or something.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.700]   We need a coffee maker, like a place-
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.660]   - I'm surprised you don't have a coffee maker, actually.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.180]   I was thinking about that the other day
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.020]   when I was at work.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.460]   - I have this weird block about decorating
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.820]   and furnishing the HQ.
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.020]   I don't know, you gotta help me with this.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.220]   We gotta make this place a reason.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.180]   I wanna be able to go get like a bowl of Magic Spoon cereal
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.580]   and a cup of coffee in these offices
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.080]   without me having to go home.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.100]   - I'm gonna bring the camera next week
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.540]   and we can film it and then show the audience
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.420]   and then they can start motivating you to-
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.940]   - It will be peer pressure.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.900]   Peer pressure from the viewers will say,
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.380]   "You gotta make this HQ better."
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.580]   Like we're trying to live vicariously here
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:40.580]   and it looks like this was like a crime scene or something.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:43.260]   It was a crime scene and this is after
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.260]   they took most of the stuff away for evidence
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.460]   and this is what's left.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.580]   So, okay, I like that idea.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.860]   Let's do, speaking of decorating,
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.340]   which is gonna cost some money,
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.360]   one more sponsor to talk about,
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.260]   and that is ExpressVPN.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.900]   Jesse, do you know what a VPN is?
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.500]   - Only through you 'cause you've explained it before, but-
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.140]   - Yeah, so my explanation as a computer scientist
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.780]   is that with a VPN,
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:11.420]   when you wanna connect to a website, right?
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:15.300]   So, Jesse is at the gym and is connecting
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.100]   to magicspoon.com to order something.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.700]   Instead of just directly connecting to that website
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.860]   where everyone can look at your packet
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.420]   and say, "Who are you connecting to?
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.840]   "Why are you connecting to them?
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.500]   "Maybe you had too much Magic Spoon,"
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.700]   or whatever the issue is, a VPN says,
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.540]   "No, what you do instead is form a connection
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.540]   "to a VPN server."
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.220]   So you have an encrypted connection to the VPN server
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.540]   and you tell that VPN server,
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.660]   your browser or whatever software you're using,
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.080]   tells that server through an encrypted connection,
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.780]   "This is the website I really wanna talk to."
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.860]   And then the server talks to that website on your behalf.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:51.680]   And then it gets the answer back from that website
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.660]   or from whatever service you're trying to access
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.060]   and then sends that back to you
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.460]   over this encrypted connection.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.200]   So no one around you knows what you're up to.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.540]   The ISP you connect to, the access point at your gym,
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.960]   whatever, can't keep track of who are you connecting to,
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.560]   who are you talking to.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.760]   So there's a lot of reasons why you might use a VPN.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.340]   There's security reasons, there's privacy reasons,
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.460]   but there's one cool little benefit you can get from them.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.860]   With a service like ExpressVPN,
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.800]   they have VPN servers all around the world
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.020]   you can choose to connect to.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.720]   So if you are connecting to a service
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.720]   through a VPN server somewhere else around the world,
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.800]   that service thinks you're coming from that country.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.120]   So Netflix, for example, offers different content
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.000]   based on where you are in the world.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.880]   So if you wanna unlock different Netflix content,
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   you can just connect to an ExpressVPN server in that country
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.000]   and then just use Netflix as normal.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.560]   And you will see only the Netflix content
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.680]   that's available to that country.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.300]   So it's actually pretty surprising
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.440]   how much stuff you're missing.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.280]   The copy here says, "Watching Netflix
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.640]   without using ExpressVPN is like paying
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.200]   for a gym membership,
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.560]   but only being able to use the treadmill."
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.640]   Jesse, that sounds like something that you would not,
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.680]   you would not tolerate that, I would assume,
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.400]   as someone who spends a lot of time in gyms.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.840]   - I agree, I agree, for sure.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.320]   I like to get around, see different equipment.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.960]   - So before the pandemic,
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.320]   I traveled a lot internationally in my role as a professor
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.680]   and as a writer.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.600]   So I use VPNs all the time, especially when I'm overseas,
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.400]   because A, I don't know who's tracking me
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.200]   and B, I wanna be able to access services
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.040]   back in the States, for example.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.960]   ExpressVPN is my go-to.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.580]   Here's what they have that makes it my favorite.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.240]   Many different server locations.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.080]   So wherever you are,
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.240]   there's probably a server not too far away.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.640]   Really fast speeds.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.080]   This is everything with a VPN.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.420]   You have to have fast speeds
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.360]   because now you're going through an intermediate server.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.080]   They have blazingly fast speeds, great encryption setup,
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.560]   and it's really seamless
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.680]   the way it works with your computer.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.200]   You're just using your computer like normal
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.040]   and you're going through the ExpressVPN servers.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.560]   You wanna do a VPN, which you should.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.540]   ExpressVPN is my recommendation.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.440]   So be smart, stop paying full price for streaming services
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.600]   and only getting access to a fraction of their content.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.600]   Get your money's worth at expressvpn.com/deep.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:16.200]   Don't forget to use my link at expressvpn.com/deep
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.640]   and you will get an extra three months
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.080]   of ExpressVPN for free.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.760]   Three months is pretty good.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.600]   - Yeah.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.440]   - Give it a try.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.480]   All right, well, now that we are about seven hours
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.660]   into this podcast,
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.620]   we'll do a few deep life questions
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.880]   and then we'll wrap it up.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.680]   I blame myself.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.760]   I get excited about core ideas.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.720]   Like I got, yeah, slow productivity is exciting to me.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.520]   So I sort of had to go on a tangent there.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.620]   - No, that was great.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.400]   - All right, what do we got here?
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.180]   Question number one comes from Anne.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.240]   Anne is asking about time management for undergraduates
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.320]   from underrepresented backgrounds.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.860]   She's a university professor,
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.280]   mentor students from traditionally
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.520]   underrepresented backgrounds.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.440]   So Anne says, and this is interesting.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.940]   When we talk about time management,
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.800]   often the challenging part for these students
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.680]   is getting their parents or younger siblings
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.280]   to respect their deep work time.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.800]   I find this challenge really different
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.020]   than what I face as a parent,
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.200]   where it's much easier for me to carve out time for my work
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.000]   because I'm the head of the household.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.520]   What would you recommend for non-traditional students
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.280]   in building effective time management strategies
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.560]   that take into account multi-generational households
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.080]   and unique demands faced by underrepresented minorities?
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.320]   It's a good question.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.160]   And an interesting thing I would say about my college books
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.120]   and in particular, how to become a straight A student,
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.080]   is as far as I can tell,
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.120]   the number one market for that book
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.680]   is non-traditional college students.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.320]   You would imagine, oh, that book is read by
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.840]   a bunch of young Cal Newports.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.800]   It's a traditional 19-year-old residential college.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.280]   They're there for four years.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.160]   That's actually not the number one market for that book
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.800]   because the traditional 19-year-old
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.240]   coming to a residential college
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.840]   out of their upper middle-class neighborhood,
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.000]   they don't even really want advice.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.600]   To them, college is like a social experience
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.040]   as much as an intellectual one,
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.360]   and they just wanna have fun.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.280]   But it's non-traditional students
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.960]   from many different definitions of that term
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.600]   that are much more focused on,
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.040]   hey, I'm here to learn and to get grades
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.880]   to open up opportunities, are way more receptive to,
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.480]   I want every piece of advice I can get.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.600]   So how to become a straight A student, for example,
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.200]   is used in a lot of first-generation
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.320]   college mentoring programs
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.280]   where a lot of schools like Georgetown
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.480]   will have a very particular program
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   if you're a first-generational student.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.040]   And how to become a straight A student
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.720]   is used a lot, it's used in some veteran,
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.600]   military veteran programs.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.120]   We're preparing military vets
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.480]   who are returning to college
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.760]   a little bit later in life on the GI Bill.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.640]   Let's get our act together, let's get after it.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.560]   So I'll just say that as a preamble.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.560]   The books like How to Become a Straight A Student
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560]   are, I think, more popular among people
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.920]   who are much more willing to say,
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.720]   I wanna do this well, and I'm looking for advice.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.800]   All right, so how do we deal with that particular problem
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.240]   of carving out time?
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.000]   The things I think are important is
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.640]   you need to treat your schoolwork in this situation
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.400]   using the same idioms with which you would treat a job.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.520]   This is my job, it's a part-time job I have,
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.440]   it's a part-time job which is getting this degree
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.200]   from this school, right?
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.680]   So first of all, when talking to your family,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.200]   talking to your relatives, talking to your friends,
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.240]   this is one of my part-time jobs.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.080]   Then you have to actually treat it like a job,
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.640]   meaning this is when and where I do the work.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.640]   This is the idiom surrounding work we're much more used to.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.400]   Oh, you have a job, and you have shifts,
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.840]   and these shifts are on these days at these times.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.680]   All right, when you have a shift for your work,
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.680]   you're not available to do something else.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.240]   We understand those conventions.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.440]   You have to essentially in this situation
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.040]   treat your schoolwork the same way.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.520]   And this is where autopilot scheduling
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.120]   is gonna play a really big role.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.720]   Let me look at all the work I have to do
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.320]   on a regular basis for my classes.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.840]   Let me figure out when and where I always do that work,
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.080]   and then I can make that really clear.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.560]   This is my shift schedule for school.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.720]   And then people just recognize,
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.760]   ah, it's Tuesday from four to six.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.160]   That's when he's working on school.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.280]   So we just know he's not available then.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.080]   As opposed to treating it more, again,
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.160]   like a student at a residential college
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.440]   where you just say, man, what's due tomorrow?
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.840]   Ah, man, I got a lot of things due tomorrow.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.960]   I better go do a lot of work.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.600]   And suddenly there's other people saying,
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.000]   wait, we needed you to help look after your little brother,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.120]   and we need you to give a ride for your grandma.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.000]   Like, you can't just be gone all day.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.200]   Like, you didn't tell us about this.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.200]   We have stuff we need to do.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.120]   So you have to actually really focus, I think,
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.760]   on the autopilot scheduling approach to schoolwork
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.200]   when you're in these situations
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.440]   where it's not just my full-time job
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.920]   is I'm at school living in a dorm,
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.040]   and I have nothing else going on.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.600]   So that is what I'd recommend.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.680]   To the extent possible,
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.240]   do this work not in your house, too.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.360]   I think that makes it more clear.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.520]   If you can do it on the campus
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.520]   where you're taking the classes,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.160]   if you can do it surrounding the classes,
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.240]   works really well.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.920]   I'm going to school to the lecture,
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.320]   and then for the next hour after the lecture,
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.320]   I do the schoolwork related to the next lecture.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:29.200]   So it's all just combined with I'm gone, doing school,
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.480]   it's my shift, and then I'm back.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.360]   So that clarity, I think, is gonna go a long way.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.920]   We got a question here from a frustrated mom
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.040]   who is asking about college admissions hysteria
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.080]   and the selectivity of colleges for future employment.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.160]   Let me excerpt this question a little bit.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.800]   But this querier says,
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.640]   "My teenager is utterly unmotivated
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.520]   and likely has an undiagnosed learning disability
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.880]   because she seems quite intelligent outside of academics.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.560]   I'm in California where kids seem to take an average
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.160]   of eight AP exams and seem to have weighted GPAs over four.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.360]   I worry for her future,
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.240]   and it upsets me when people point to examples
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.680]   like Steve Jobs or Larry Ellison
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.440]   and claim a college degree is not important to succeed.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.240]   If this were true, then please tell me why companies
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.560]   aren't lining up the higher out of high school
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.040]   or community college or second tier schools,
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.520]   but all make a beeline the higher from the Ivies."
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.040]   And she says, "What about kids who need to work
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.280]   or can't handle the pressure of doing it all?
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.640]   If college was so optional,
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.880]   then why the hiring queues outside of Harvard and Princeton
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.760]   and why the sentencing of teens who didn't do it all
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.360]   at an already vulnerable time in their lives?"
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.440]   All right, so frustrated mom,
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.000]   this is something I used to do a lot of work on,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.160]   college admissions stress.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.760]   When I was a graduate student in the first decade
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.200]   of the 2000s,
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.640]   there was a huge issue with college student stress
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.680]   because of two things that occurred during this period.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.680]   One was demographics.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.520]   So I'm a part of the millennial generation,
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.040]   which is the children of the baby boomers.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.200]   It's a very large demographic group.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.360]   I'm at the very older end of the millennials, right?
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.800]   So I'm one of the first millennials.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.240]   So when I was just arriving at graduate school,
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:23.280]   you had a huge number of millennials
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.000]   entering college admission season.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.280]   So there's suddenly this huge strain on college admissions.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.360]   And then at the same time,
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   they introduced the common application.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.600]   So it used to be like when I applied to school,
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.040]   when I wanted to apply, I applied to Dartmouth,
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.600]   there was an application for Dartmouth.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.080]   And I had to go use a typewriter at my dad's office
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.360]   because you had to typewrite in information in the fields.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.520]   And for your essays,
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.040]   you would write your essays and print them.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.040]   And I vaguely remember like pasting them into this thing.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.400]   I mean, the application was a physical booklet
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.240]   you would send away for you,
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.440]   you would send them money
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.160]   and they would send you back this thing.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.480]   And it was a huge pain.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.680]   So you were pretty selective.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.280]   I'm applying to three schools and it took me a while.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.480]   But the common app, it was,
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.000]   oh, I fill out all this information on the website once
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.720]   and I can apply to anywhere I want
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.680]   just by clicking a button.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.600]   And now suddenly people are applying to 20, 30 schools.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.600]   And everyone who is at least a little bit smart would say,
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.720]   well, I might as well just do Harvard.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.560]   I might as well do Princeton,
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.000]   I might as well do Yale, you never know.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.200]   And suddenly they had these admissions percentages
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.120]   that just seemed like they were plummeting.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.200]   When in reality, it was just,
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.760]   you had a bunch more people applying
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.920]   who never would have before
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.520]   because they already knew they weren't gonna get in.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.200]   Anyways, it caused a huge issue.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   College admission stress became a problem.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.880]   There was a bunch of national cases,
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.840]   case studies that were drawing national attention
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.120]   like Gunn High School in Palo Alto, California,
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.360]   where they had a string of suicides.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.880]   This was starting to happen with high school students.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.560]   Which is all to say, I wrote a book eventually
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.200]   called "How to Become a High School Superstar."
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.920]   And it was all about defusing college admissions stress.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.120]   So I feel your pain.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.400]   Let me give you a few points
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.680]   before I just say read that book,
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.040]   which by the way, I think you're gonna like.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.320]   But let me give you a few points.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.760]   Yes, college matters.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.000]   Ignore the Silicon Valley types that say,
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.200]   Steve Jobs didn't go to college.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.120]   Because your kid's not Steve Jobs.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.360]   And your kid's not Larry Ellison.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   And so yes, if you want to do a knowledge sector type job,
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.800]   like an office job, for better or for worse,
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.440]   you have to go to college.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.200]   There are obviously other types of work.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.400]   Read Matt Crawford's book, "Shop Classes," "Soul Craft."
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.160]   That there's a lot of other really good work
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.880]   that has to do with skilled manual trades,
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.680]   which I think we definitely overlook.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.640]   But I think the people for which that is well-suited
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.480]   know that.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.480]   It doesn't sound like this is your daughter.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.560]   Like there's some people that know,
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.640]   like I want to repair things and fix things
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.960]   or work on a ranch.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.800]   And the people who want to do that know they want to do that.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.200]   And I think we need to normalize that more.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.600]   But if that's not your path, yeah, college matters.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.080]   So yes, I agree.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.040]   You can't just skip colleges.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.840]   I also agree, yes, it's true
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   that the very selective colleges
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.160]   open up a lot more opportunities,
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.560]   especially for very high paying elite jobs.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.320]   They go to the very selective colleges
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.320]   to do that type of recruiting.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.560]   You know, there was this famous study
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:13.840]   that everyone kept talking about
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.680]   during that first wave of college stress.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.640]   There's this famous study that people are talking about
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.600]   that said, aha, it doesn't matter what school you go to.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.600]   See, we did this study where we looked at students
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.120]   who got into good schools, but also to less good schools
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.520]   and went to the less good school
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.360]   and some went to the better school and it didn't matter.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.600]   In the end, they both did as well.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.880]   So it's the person, not the school that really matters.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.000]   This study was really popular because people like that idea.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.320]   Don't over sweat the school you go to,
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.560]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.560]   I wrote an article about this way back when, like in 2008.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.400]   That's a crazy interpretation of the data.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.640]   If you actually look at this study,
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.240]   it turned out to matter quite a bit, actually.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.960]   If you went to a better school,
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.520]   you made more money out of it.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.640]   It was crazy the interpretations
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.440]   that media outlets were making of that study.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.760]   And I don't mean to go on a tangent here,
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.760]   but basically there was one way you could rank schools
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.920]   by which you could show that effect went away.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.280]   That's something to do with like the median SAT score.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.400]   But if you looked at the most natural way to rank schools,
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.240]   which was looking at their ranking in a,
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.760]   it wasn't US News, it might've been Barron's,
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.320]   but whatever, just looking at their ranking,
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.640]   it made a big difference.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.480]   In these dyads, the students who went
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.360]   to the higher ranked school versus the lowest ranked school
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.200]   made more money.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.040]   Okay, so that's true.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.160]   There's jobs that are open to people in the Ivy Leagues
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.280]   that aren't open otherwise.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.720]   You can't do much about that.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.840]   Can't do much about that, that's true.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.800]   But I'm gonna try to make you feel better here,
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.640]   frustrated mom.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.040]   I don't think you want most of those jobs.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.760]   Yes, you can be a derivatives trader,
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.520]   you can be a management consultant,
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.360]   and that you can get into really good law schools,
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.520]   but I don't know that you're not, so?
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.720]   Like, so where does that end you, right?
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.200]   That you have a very expensive penthouse apartment
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.320]   in New York, I mean, you're also completely stressed out
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.800]   and alienated from your family
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.400]   'cause you're a managing director at a big bank.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.320]   I mean, some people wanna do that, most people don't.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.520]   So that's my first point, so what?
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.080]   And then two, I would say,
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.560]   don't think about that hype.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.200]   Go to a good school, go to the best school you can get into,
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.440]   do well when you're at that school,
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.400]   find an interesting job that gives you options,
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.640]   do career capital theory
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.800]   and lifestyle-centric career planning,
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.120]   make yourself an awesome life.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.040]   That's the recipe.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.400]   And California's crazy about this stuff.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.520]   DC is kinda bad about it,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.160]   California's crazy about this type of college stuff.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.880]   And they really, and I can see it in your question,
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.960]   so I have so much empathy here,
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.440]   but they really get under your skin
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.440]   and make it seem like, well,
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.440]   if you're not going to Yale or University of Chicago,
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.320]   dot, dot, dot, but you know what?
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.480]   Follow out that dot, dot, dot.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.840]   What happens?
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.080]   Yeah, I don't get to go work for Goldman Sachs.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.560]   I would say, congratulations,
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.160]   you don't wanna do that anyways, right?
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.200]   I mean, what happens?
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.400]   So you focus on your grades, get the best grades you can,
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.440]   go to a good school.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.600]   My advice is typically go to your state school
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.200]   unless you can get into a small number of very elite schools
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.120]   that are much, much better than your state school.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.360]   I'm a bit of a curmudgeon on this,
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.280]   I'm not a big believer in shopping
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.920]   for random private schools that are nowhere near you
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.440]   just because you like the look of the campus.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.040]   I mean this with respect, teenagers,
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.600]   because I'm talking about myself at that age,
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.200]   but 18-year-olds and 17-year-olds are idiots.
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.400]   How much do we really wanna give them
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.680]   weight to their decision of,
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.520]   "No, I definitely need to go to this random school
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.520]   "halfway across the country."
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.400]   I was like, go to your state school probably,
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.600]   unless you can get into a fantastic school.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.360]   Okay, if you're really into government and politics
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.600]   and get into Georgetown, go to Georgetown.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.720]   But don't go to a random private school
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.680]   halfway around the country
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.960]   because you like something in their brochure
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.000]   about their gym and the campus look nice.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.560]   Go to your state school unless you get into an elite school.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.440]   Don't overschedule, do really well in your major,
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.080]   get good grades, this will open up job opportunities,
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.000]   build a cool life.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.400]   I think that's the takeaway message.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.000]   So to bring that back to my book,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.960]   what I did in that book,
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.160]   "How to Become a High School Superstar"
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.520]   is I profiled a bunch of kids
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.320]   that did fine in college admissions
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.880]   but weren't at all stressed out.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.800]   And I kinda walked through what their life was like,
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.840]   what matters, what doesn't.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.560]   And spoiler alert, they're not overscheduled,
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.480]   they wander and stumble into interesting things,
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.160]   they're pretty smart about their study habits
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.720]   so they get good grades without having to study all the time
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.800]   and that's kind of it.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.360]   So I am giving you permission, frustrated mom,
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.120]   to not get too caught up
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.400]   in this selective college hysteria.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.600]   You should help your daughter with good study habits,
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.280]   don't overschedule her,
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.480]   let her live up to her academic potential,
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.240]   go to the good school,
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.360]   maybe one of the great UC system schools,
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.080]   don't pay twice as much to go to a school
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   across the country,
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.480]   and let them do well there, read my type of advice,
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.920]   find themselves, find their flow, do good work,
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.080]   and then lifestyle-centric career planning,
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.600]   build a really cool, interesting life.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.200]   I think that is what most people should be doing
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.240]   and we need to stop obsessing about this dream
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.320]   that, I don't know, you're gonna go to Harvard
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.480]   and then the Yale Law School
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.600]   and be like a senator at 30 or something like that.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.080]   Hey, spoiler alert, that's not gonna happen to you.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.840]   Like it's gonna happen to a small number of people
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.280]   but don't build your whole life around
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.320]   that's what you need to do, I guess.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.720]   What did you, was it like,
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.680]   Jesse, did you have that pressure?
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.400]   How do you remember that college?
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.480]   Because we were the same age.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.320]   We were like--
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.200]   - It's funny you bring up the common application.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.640]   - Because it got worse,
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.560]   right after we went through this whole thing.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.880]   - Yeah, I mean, the common application was key to me
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.240]   'cause I never would have applied to Tufts
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.080]   if they didn't take it.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.640]   I just submitted at the last minute
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.960]   and ended up getting accepted.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.860]   And then once I weighed other schools,
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:08.120]   I selected it and ended up having a great time and loved it.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:12.600]   But I didn't think about the admission rates
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.480]   with the common application until you just mentioned it.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.320]   It makes a lot of sense.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.140]   - It inflated them.
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.520]   So it made it seem super impossible.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.480]   I mean, the point I make in that book
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.120]   is the key thing about college admissions
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.600]   is that it is a vanishingly small number of schools
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.880]   and students for which things
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.640]   like your extracurricular activities or whatever matters.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.160]   For the vast majority of colleges
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.920]   and the vast majority of kids,
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.720]   what's your grades, what's your SAT scores?
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.860]   Are they in the range of our accepted students?
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:39.880]   Yes, you get to come here.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.320]   That's the vast majority of colleges,
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.420]   the vast majority of kids.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:47.420]   So get the best grades you can, get good SAT scores,
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:50.080]   pick, find schools that you're in the middle of that range,
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.680]   go to those schools, don't even sweat it.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.680]   It's such a small subset of people
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.440]   for which you're applying to a school
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.060]   in which they're like, we have so many students
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:00.800]   who have grades that are pegged at the top of our range
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.360]   that now we have to start differentiating
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.200]   among other factors.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.720]   But even then, that's not most students
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.600]   because a lot of those slots are reserved
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.360]   for various sports or for the orchestra needs someone
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.180]   to be able to play a part in that.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.240]   So now we're down to a really small number of students.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.280]   And then there's some shoe-ins
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.400]   because these type of colleges want as interesting
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.640]   as a possible of class.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.760]   So there's just some really interesting people.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.560]   And then there's people who are daughters of presidents,
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.680]   so they need to come here too
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.840]   because we're trying to create a whatever.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.760]   And now we're down to a very small number of slots
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.000]   at a very small number of schools
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.520]   where you have an admissions officer saying,
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.640]   what activities do you do?
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.440]   And I know that everyone is obsessed with,
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.360]   what are my activities?
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.600]   And they're wrong about it.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.920]   That's the whole point in that book.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:51.120]   One of the big points in my book is that people are wrong
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.560]   in terms of what they think is important
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.800]   when it comes to activities.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.960]   They focus way too much on quantity,
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.960]   thinking somehow that raw quantity of activities
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.160]   is somehow impressive.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.800]   It's not.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.460]   Or they fall into the trap of looking for activities
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.340]   that have incredibly clear competitive structures,
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.800]   like am I the first chair of the state orchestra?
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.640]   Only one person in your state gets to be that
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.480]   for the instrument,
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.560]   so it's not necessarily a great place to be competing.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.560]   So I don't mean to rant,
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.520]   but I just wanna give more people permission to say,
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.320]   I'm gonna get the grades that,
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.880]   I'm gonna work hard, get good grades,
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.680]   see what schools that opens up, go to that school,
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.680]   have a good experience in that school, build a cool life.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.720]   And we look, and of course I'm saying this
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.240]   as someone who went to an Ivy League school
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.480]   and trained at MIT.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.860]   So maybe it's easy for me to say,
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:36.920]   but I don't know that my school opened up
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.920]   for the vast majority of my peers,
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.560]   really cool, interesting, happy lives.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.840]   They all just went to Harvard Law School.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.360]   Everyone I know just went to Harvard Law School
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.800]   and are all law partners now and are tired.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.120]   So congratulations.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.800]   They have nice houses though, but.
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.100]   Oh, well, all right.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.720]   We should probably call this one, Jesse.
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.560]   What do you think?
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.760]   We're at like an hour 30 here.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.040]   (Jesse laughs)
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.840]   - Sounds good to me.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.800]   - All right, everyone.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.680]   Well, thank you for sending in your questions.
