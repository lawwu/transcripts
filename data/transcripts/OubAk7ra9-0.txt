[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   All right, well I'm refreshed Jesse, so let's do some questions. What do you think?
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.880]   Should we start with a call? Is that what we're doing here? Yeah, let's start with a
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.440]   call. We got a call from Erica and she's gonna talk about anxiety and time block
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:23.120]   planning. Hello, my name is Erica. I am a return caller and general asker of
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:31.480]   questions. Today my question is regarding anxiety and time block planning. So one
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.680]   side of me loves to have my schedule set so I don't have to think about it, but
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.080]   when I get to the day where I have something planned at a certain time, I
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.240]   get anxiety because there's this other side of me that loves flexibility. I do
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.480]   like schedule throughout my day some unstructured time, but and once I start
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.480]   an activity I'm usually happy with doing the activity, but I just get a lot of
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.600]   inertial pre-event anxiety and just you know a feeling of not wanting to do a
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.680]   certain thing at the time I have it. So I'll give a good example, like I schedule
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.840]   a reservation at a restaurant you know like a month in advance or something and
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.200]   that I'm really excited for, but when the day comes I just don't like feeling
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.240]   boxed in and having to be at the restaurant at a certain time, but then I
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.640]   get there and I love it. So do you have any like tips or thoughts on how I might
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.960]   be able to just get over this I don't know I don't know I don't know the right
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.880]   term for it I guess pre-inertial anxiety towards a structured schedule event.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.000]   All right thank you very much take care bye. Well I mean Erika this is similar to
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   what we were chatting about at the top of the show about the the resistance I
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   feel to restarting my full-time block planning system at the beginning of the
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.360]   fall. You're feeling this but basically on the scale of individual scheduled
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.640]   events or blocks same underlying mechanisms and is quite normal. Our brain
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.120]   does not understand by understand I mean has not been evolved over deep history
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.560]   time to last two to three hundred thousand years where modern homo sapiens
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.080]   have walked the earth. It has not evolved to work with scheduled events it's not
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.680]   evolved to work with I am now going to start doing this task because it's drawn
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.880]   up in a box on a piece of paper. I am now going to head over to a restaurant to
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.840]   eat because it's in my planner that that's what happens next. That is not how
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.800]   our motivational loops are evolved to actually function. They're functioning
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.600]   they're meant to function on much more immediate and clear stimuli. We need more
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.920]   food we're going for a hunt. This person who's in front of me who I can see so
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.480]   all of the social networks that take up so much of my neuron neuronal space in
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.800]   my brain are all fired up and looking at this person in front of me who's a part
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.520]   of my tribe who's asking for my help. Oh yeah we're gonna go help that person. We
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.440]   expect these more acute stimuli. The brain does not understand a small box
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.760]   written one of these or a little green glowing screen box on your screen your
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.080]   Google calendar for an appointment. It doesn't understand that. So we have some
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.480]   trouble literally getting the motivational system to put the right
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.320]   chemicals into our system that gets us up and actually moving. There's something
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.120]   called the ventral striatum that's involved in this. The neuroscience gets
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.800]   complicated. Details don't matter. We can we'll get Andrew Huberman on the line if
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.680]   we really want to get into this but let's just rest assured this is what our
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.960]   brain does. Different people Erica have different reactions to this mismatch.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.920]   Right so some people it's yeah whatever. Yeah you have to just kind of bull rush
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.480]   into the task then you get going. It's minor. Other people like you Erica the
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.000]   mismatch triggers anxiety which again chemicals. Anxiety is a physical feeling.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.200]   There's a constriction in the chest. There's a difficulty in the breathing.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.600]   You can you can do some self scanning and say this is just physical hormonal
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.400]   chemical driven reaction. The autonomic immune system or nervous system rather
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.080]   is involved in this. And so for you and a lot of other people this mismatch can
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:41.120]   create literal anxiety. The thing we have to do about this put bluntly is sort of
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.920]   ignore. I mean we can recognize my brain does this just like my knee hurts when a
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.000]   storm is coming. But beyond recognizing it we still go forward. We still go
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.120]   forward because let me tell you let's say you get rid of your time block
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.240]   planning during the day like let's just rock and roll so I don't have to have
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.160]   the anxiety of having something scheduled. You're opening yourself up to a
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.000]   much more existential anxiety because you're gonna just ping-pong back and
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.040]   forth randomly putting out fires not making progress on things are important
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.000]   forgetting about things having to scramble at the last minute to get
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.680]   things done. This is not from a physiological perspective or a
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.640]   psychological perspective a better subjective experience. It's a deeper
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.760]   existential anxiety you're gonna feel. So you're trading one for the other. Same
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.600]   thing if you know you don't go to the restaurant. You don't go to the party.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.520]   You're not gonna feel better. You'll get like relief in the moment because you're
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.720]   resolving the mismatch but you're not around friends. You're not doing
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.760]   interesting things. And you know I get that too Erica. I don't get I don't get
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.160]   anxiety around blocks if it's just work I've put aside. I just get normal
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.400]   resistance. When you throw a there's different aspects sometimes there's
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.720]   social aspects so this might be what you have there might be like a social aspect
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.560]   in there where there's a little bit of social anxiety so that could exaggerate
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.640]   it. I don't have that so much but I have as I talked about on the show these
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.200]   weird deep-rooted issues with surrounding sleep and so I'll sometimes
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.560]   get this around events if they're at night. Like you know it's I don't know
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.040]   how late it's gonna go and what my sleep and and you know what I've learned to do
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   is say okay thank you brain. Welcome anxiety. I'm glad you're here.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.840]   Chemicals. You'll pass soon and I'm gonna go on and keep doing this thing. So
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.280]   that's what I say Erica. It's natural. It's not that you shouldn't find it that
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   interesting in the sense of like it here this comes it'll go and you make the
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.440]   plans that are good. You execute the plans and find pride in your action and
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.480]   not give so much attention to the physiological. It's gonna do its thing
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.720]   and then Erica you're gonna do your thing. Because more often than not it's
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.080]   gonna be like an enjoyable experience to like going to the party or going to the
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.400]   gym or yeah and that's what game or that's what I'm trying to separate here
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.680]   is like how much how much we're dealing with the the planning mismatch with
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.280]   Erica which is a real thing. I mean people sometimes anxiety a lot of times
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   just procrastination. It's like really hard for people to get started on things
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.440]   that are just that are planned in some sort of abstract or arbitrary system and
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.200]   there's also social anxiety and she's mentioned both in the call so I'm
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   assuming they're kind of all mixed together. Yeah I mean social anxiety is
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.400]   its own its own thing which again is completely natural because our brain is
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.760]   so attuned to the sociality that you know a lot of what you know 20th first
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.800]   century like social life is not exactly what our brain expects. It expects like
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.760]   this is my tribe that I am around all day. Yeah I'm with them all day. It's why
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.120]   I'm miserable when I'm alone but if it's strangers and some people I don't know
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.640]   and it's in like a bar I haven't been to the brain is like I don't know about
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.240]   this. Mm-hmm. Some people care more than others. You have negative social anxiety
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.480]   as far as I can tell. You love people and you love doing things. Well I'm around a
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.520]   lot of people a lot like in various my other jobs and stuff. Yeah. And yeah I do
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.440]   a lot of things too I guess. That's a spectrum. See like probably for you the
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.680]   way that wiring is set up is you see the the potential opportunity in a novel
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.680]   social environment. Like oh something cool could happen I could meet someone
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.800]   interesting maybe I'll see something interesting. Yeah. And for other people it
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.160]   will be but what happens if I get there and like I can't find the I can't find
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.040]   the person or like as I as I walk into the as I walk into the room like I'm
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.720]   immediately you know caught catch on fire or whatever it is. The waiter spills
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.880]   water on me. Yeah. Really. I had a friend we used to joke about that when be
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.440]   anxious about like going to a bar we'd never been at before and we try to one
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.600]   up each other on our predictions for what was going to happen and it would
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.360]   usually end up with like as the door open just three or four people already
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.240]   at a full sprint are just charging you to take you down and to beat you with
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.360]   some sort of like bats or blackjack so that we'd see like how how how
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.960]   exaggerated we could make the story that would you know explain some social
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.920]   anxiety like as soon as you're in the door it's just going to be like fire boys
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.120]   and like immediately or someone with a flamethrower and you know you over the
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.240]   top
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:25.280]   [Music]
