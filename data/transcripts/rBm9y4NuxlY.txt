[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:11.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:20.280]   - Welcome to Portfolio Rescue.

[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.320]   Our inbox is overflowing with good questions from people.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.480]   Duncan and I have been going through those
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.200]   for the past couple of weeks.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.040]   All great questions, so we're pretty much never
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.460]   gonna run out of stuff to talk about on the show, right?
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.960]   Duncan, topics are never-ending.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.600]   If you, remember, if you have a question,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.280]   email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.

[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.480]   We're just providing context and some help
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.240]   to help you through decisions here.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.120]   Remember, it's not just gonna be me and Duncan here
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.000]   at all times, we're gonna bring some experts on,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.360]   maybe multiple experts today, hint, hint.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.200]   Duncan, let's get into it.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.320]   What's the first question?
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.120]   - Okay, good morning, everyone, and hey, Ben.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.640]   First, I did want to mention, some of you might have tuned
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.160]   in thinking we were gonna do your question today.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.520]   Don't worry, it's gonna be next week now.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.880]   We rearranged things a little bit, so.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.840]   - We're breaking hearts, Duncan.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.040]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly so.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.800]   - We had something planned, it didn't work out,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.600]   and we're gonna do it in the next couple weeks, so.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.760]   - Yeah, we'll get to it, so yeah.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.920]   - It happens.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.320]   - Okay, so first up, our first question today
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.160]   comes from Billy, and so Billy writes,
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   I'm 61 years old, and I've been retired for two years.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.360]   I have a 90/10 portfolio, and my friends
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.440]   and no-fee financial planner advise me
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.280]   that I'm too aggressively invested,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.560]   and that I should have more bond exposure.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560]   You've won the game, why take a risk at this point,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.000]   is what they've told him.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.480]   They seem to have totally bought into the 60/40 portfolio,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.760]   but I don't see it that way.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.720]   At my current spending, I don't use any of my portfolio.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.080]   Even doubling my expenditures,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.880]   I would still have 10 years of income to pull
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.560]   from the fixed income assets alone,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.840]   and then Social Security would kick in.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.160]   What would you advise someone in my financial situation
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.960]   to do regarding bond allocation?
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.080]   I think I have enough.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.840]   - All right, so before we get into some of the
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.000]   nitty gritty here, John, play my favorite
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.600]   George Carlin clip here real quick.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.160]   - Have you ever noticed when you're driving
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.800]   that anyone who's driving slower than you is an idiot,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.960]   and anyone driving faster than you is a maniac?
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.280]   - Say, look at this idiot here,
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.000]   will you just look at this idiot just creeping along?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240]   Whoa, look at that maniac, go!
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.320]   - Perfect.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   All right, this is the way that I view
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.080]   when you have people look at your asset allocation
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.640]   versus other people, because the secret is
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.080]   there's no perfect portfolio, right?
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.320]   It's all about striking the right balance
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.000]   between your willingness, need, and ability to take risk.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.680]   And obviously, this is a little different
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.120]   because this person is in retirement,
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.960]   and they're thinking about,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.000]   well, how do I allow my portfolio to make it?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.200]   And they did give us a few more tidbits here.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.040]   We couldn't include 'em all
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.080]   'cause this is a very long question, but--
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.160]   - Yeah, lots of detail.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040]   - Yeah, but they said they're basically taking 1%
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.960]   from their portfolio, because they have Social Security,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.600]   because they have other income coming in,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.320]   they're not taking much from their portfolio, 1% every year.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.640]   And so, while some people would say that's insane,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.760]   why would you take a 90/10 portfolio in retirement?
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.280]   You have no savings coming in.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.720]   If there's a nasty bear market,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.140]   you might not be able to make it back.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.560]   If you have, if you're taking 1% from your portfolio,
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.720]   and you have 10% in fixed income,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.560]   that's 10 years worth of spending, right?
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.840]   I mean, not adjusted for inflation,
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   but pretty darn close.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.080]   So, while it seems crazy,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.560]   based on this person's circumstances, it might not be.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.000]   The thing is, there's a difference between
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.320]   do you need to take risk and do you want to take risk, right?
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   So, there's two hugely wealthy families
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.600]   in Western Michigan that I know of
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.040]   that have family offices, both billionaires.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.720]   And one of the billionaire families
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.220]   has all of their money in private equity.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.360]   They have the ability to take risk.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.240]   They don't need to take risk,
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.800]   but they have the ability, so they do it.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.400]   The other family, and I know people
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.920]   who have helped to manage this money,
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.900]   have the entire portfolio in bonds.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.740]   This is a billionaire.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.120]   They don't need to have their money in bonds and safety.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.760]   They can take as much risk as they want,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.040]   but they don't want to take risk.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.400]   So, a lot of it comes down to what you need
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.200]   and what you want, and I guess a lot of this comes down
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.880]   to how flexible can your spending be, right?
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.560]   Because a lot of times, we see these 4% rules
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.040]   or 3% rules for taking money out of a portfolio.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.420]   And no one actually does that on a year in and year out
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.460]   basis without making some changes based on circumstances.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.060]   So, if we did have a nasty bear market,
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.140]   are you willing to cut back your spending potentially
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.980]   because you don't want to sell down your stock portfolio
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.980]   when the crap hits the fan, right?
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.820]   So, and I guess are you willing to, worst case scenario,
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.420]   spend down your whole bond portion of your portfolio
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.980]   and maybe not have much dry powder left
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.060]   to buy stocks when they're down?
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.500]   So, I think as long as your income needs are being met,
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.600]   can you do a 90/10 portfolio?
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.440]   Sure.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.720]   Are you gonna be able to sleep at night better than someone
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.000]   who had more of a 60/40 or a 70/30 or 80/20?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.440]   That's a question a lot of people are asking themselves
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.960]   these days because bond yields are so low.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.160]   But again, that right balance is never,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.520]   they're never gonna be a perfect equilibrium for everyone.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.360]   But if you don't need to take risk and you want to take risk
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.000]   and you're willing to understand those,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.520]   the potential downsides, I don't think it's necessary
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.040]   to take a conservative portfolio if you don't need one,
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.640]   especially if your spending is in line
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.920]   with what you understand your needs to be.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.520]   - Yeah, and I mean, you guys have talked about this before,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.680]   you and Michael, just how in our current environment
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.240]   over the recent years, yeah, it's hard to make the argument,
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.160]   but the future doesn't look like the past always, right?
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.840]   - Yeah, so I think it just depends how flexible
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.560]   you can be and everything's not set in stone.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.600]   All right, let's do the second question here.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.240]   - Okay, so next up, we have a fun one.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.080]   So this question is, we are a couple of millennials
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.200]   that have not been able to buy a home
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.100]   because of the barrier to entry being too high.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.900]   We live in the California Bay Area
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.380]   where housing is extremely competitive.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.400]   We've been creative and to save on costs,
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.200]   we moved into this small but lovely travel trailer
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.400]   earlier this year.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.280]   We own the trailer, which we can later sell
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.640]   to partially fund our down payment on a home,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.800]   or we can rent it out as a side hustle.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.240]   We currently pay $700 a month to rent the space
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.880]   where we are parked and about $100 a month for utilities.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.120]   We love our little trailer,
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.840]   but we can't wait to own our own home
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.720]   and begin putting equity into it.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.020]   We think we can buy a house big enough
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.760]   to convert one to two rooms into short-term rentals
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.600]   like on Airbnb.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.880]   That should be another profitable side hustle for us
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.520]   because we live in wine country
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.820]   and we're looking to buy near a local college.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.160]   All that said, we are probably a good one to two years away
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.760]   from being able to qualify for the mortgage we want.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.680]   I've got, then they go on to say that, sorry.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.320]   So basically what it comes down to
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.880]   is they're debating buying an older home
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.480]   versus a new construction home,
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.960]   keeping in mind that new construction
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.880]   will take nine to 12 months to build.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.680]   There are a lot of factors for us to consider
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.200]   and we are wondering if you all can help us
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.640]   evaluate this choice from an investment standpoint.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.440]   - All right, so basic gist of it is
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.240]   we have two millennials here living in a trailer,
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.440]   which we got a picture of the nice trailer too.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.480]   They could rent it out a little bit,
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.680]   maybe help them, they're a couple years away,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.480]   they're saving, especially 'cause they live in California.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.240]   I want to bring in my favorite person
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.720]   to go back and forth with on real estate on this,
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.680]   my Animal Spirits co-host, Michael Batnick.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.680]   You're gonna help me out with this one, Michael.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.840]   - Wait, I thought you were bringing a bill on this one.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.760]   Threw me for a loop.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.800]   All right, what are we talking about here, real estate?
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.240]   - Yes, so basically what are the pros and cons
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.600]   of buying an older home in a more established neighborhood
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.880]   versus buying new?
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.920]   So I'm making an assumption here.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.320]   Most of the homes in New York area,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.960]   probably in the suburbs are older homes
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.800]   'cause they've been there for a while
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.040]   and there's not a lot of land anymore.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.480]   So maybe you can talk about that side of things.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.440]   - Correct. - So the pros and cons
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.160]   of buying an older home.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.680]   - Okay, when it comes to doing anything handy,
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.860]   I'm worse than useless.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.280]   I can't do anything.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.960]   So I really wanted to buy a house
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.320]   that was pretty much move-in ready.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.480]   So even with the house that I bought,
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   which was, I guess it was demolished in Hurricane Sandy,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.760]   but the infrastructure of the house was there.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.440]   So they built up on top of it.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.960]   Everything was brand new.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.120]   And even still, there was issues with the home.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.120]   During the first rainstorm, I see Robin calls me.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.000]   I got trickling down.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.880]   I'm like, oh, fuck.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.440]   And it's not just that.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.480]   There have been, not that I got a lemon,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.280]   but just shit happens with houses.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.360]   And the older your house,
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.000]   the more likely you are to have expenses and pains.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.120]   So you might think that it makes sense financially
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.520]   to buy a smaller home, an older home.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.080]   But I don't know if that's necessarily
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.720]   a wise financial decision.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.160]   - So I think there are some pros about building new.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.180]   We built a new house in 2017.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.480]   You have better materials that can potentially last longer.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.160]   And like you said, fewer repairs.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.000]   With a lot of new houses,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.920]   you get some sort of warranty
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.240]   that could be 12 or 24 months,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.120]   or if something goes wrong,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.560]   and even little dings in the wall,
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.400]   they'll come fix them after a year.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.440]   - What if there's a line in your home?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.440]   - What if there's a line on your TV, right?
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.280]   - Wait, but hold on.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.640]   But most people, well, it depends where you live.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.920]   Where I live, the idea of building a home
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.600]   and helping design it or pick out stuff,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.420]   is that what you did?
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.000]   You picked out materials?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.040]   - That's one of the potential downsides.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.000]   The potential upside is you get to make it your own.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.700]   The downside is there are so many decisions
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.540]   you need to make.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.060]   I didn't know you had to make the decision,
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.860]   well, what color is the grout gonna be between the tiles?
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.660]   And what kind of light switches do you want?
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.500]   There are so many.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.100]   So if you're a person who doesn't like that,
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.780]   that could be a downside.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.420]   - But that, where I live,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.060]   is not in the cards for most people.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.100]   Certainly wasn't for me.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.660]   - So yeah, if you could--
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.100]   - No, I'm saying financially.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.340]   - Oh, right, financially.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.800]   - Like to build a home and start picking stuff out,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.460]   I don't, I mean, that's very, very rare where I live.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.360]   Most of the time, it's a builder,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.340]   and you go into the house and it's done,
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.180]   and then you can do what you want.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.760]   - And I think one of the upsides
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.400]   in this current real estate market,
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.640]   if things remain hot,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.840]   is if you buy new, you're not outbidding anyone.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.360]   You're not gonna get outbid, potentially.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.840]   Like, you know going in.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.900]   Like, so if you put a deposit down to build a new house,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.080]   no one's gonna come out and outbid you
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.960]   like you would for a single-family home
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.880]   and an existing family home that you could get outbid on.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.420]   - The question here,
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.360]   the question here is what's gonna hold more value, I think.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.700]   Is it buying an old home in an established neighborhood
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.000]   or building a new home in a newish neighborhood?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.600]   Was that the gist of the question?
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.320]   - Yeah, and I would think holding value-wise new, probably.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.800]   A lot of it depends on your style, too,
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.360]   'cause some people like the charm of older homes
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.400]   that you don't get anymore.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.520]   They don't want the modern stuff.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.640]   - Not to pull a Ben Carlson,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.100]   but don't you think the answer to this question
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.240]   is it depends?
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.680]   It depends on the neighborhood.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.440]   - Yes, I will say from personal experience,
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   buying a new home,
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.480]   I think it saves you a lot of years of headache and pain
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.200]   of having to fix stuff.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.140]   There's a lot of stuff you just don't have to worry about
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.680]   for a long time.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.520]   - Yeah.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.360]   - A new roof, a new water heater,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.080]   all that kind of stuff you don't have to worry about.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.280]   - Am I getting kicked out now?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.240]   - Yeah, see you later.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.080]   - All right, bye.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.600]   - Duncan, it's question three.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.100]   - Okay, so next up we have one from Alex,
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.720]   and so Alex is writing in about municipal bonds.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.760]   He says, "One asset class that I haven't wrapped my head
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.380]   "around is municipal bonds.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.560]   "Are they important, a good addition to the portfolio?
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.900]   "If so, what are the metrics
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.680]   "that I should be looking for as an investment?"
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.520]   - All right, yeah, we have the wrong one up there.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.280]   - Oh, sorry, yeah, that's the wrong question
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.120]   popping up there.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.960]   - Whatever. - Yeah, there we go.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.780]   - All right, simple one.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.480]   So I wanna bring in,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.680]   because municipal bonds have some tax benefits,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.360]   I wanna bring in our tax expert here, Bill Sweet,
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.960]   who we've had on the show before,
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.120]   to talk about some of the tax benefits of muni bonds.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.240]   Bill, here's what I know about muni bonds.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.740]   So thinking through the tax equivalent yield,
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.760]   and we use muni bonds for client portfolios,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.920]   and some of the benefits there,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.400]   you can also create a bespoke portfolio
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.560]   depending on what state you're in.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.320]   So what are the thought process here
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.920]   of creating a muni bond portfolio?
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.680]   - Yeah, last time I was on the show, Ben,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.640]   you said I had Roth IRA conversion tattooed to my back.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   It's actually tax equivalent yield.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   - All right. - And that's the topic here.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.060]   Let's start with a bond.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.440]   What's a bond do?
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.080]   You give somebody $100,000, let's say, a treasury,
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.400]   they pay a 3% coupon, that's $3,000 of interest.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.200]   Problem with that type of investing,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.900]   if you're in a non-qualified account,
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.360]   so not an IRA, not a 401(k),
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.000]   you gotta pay income tax, ordinary income tax,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.440]   on that coupon yield.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.040]   And so let's just say somebody's at 33%,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.480]   federal and state combined,
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.160]   they're giving back 1,000 out of that $3,000
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.560]   of interest annually in taxes.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.320]   And that means their tax-adjusted yield
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.100]   is only 2% of a 3% bond.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.560]   Municipals have this really, really neat feature,
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.160]   which is tax exemption.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.360]   And so you do not have to pay federal income tax
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.160]   on just about every type of municipal bond
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.720]   because of the way that the federal system works,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.080]   is that there are certain revenues
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.040]   that are tax-exempt at the federal level
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.880]   and vice versa at the state level.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.000]   And so that 3% coupon bond, if it's a municipal,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.200]   you're not paying tax on it,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.640]   you get to keep all $3,000 of that interest.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.560]   There's no tax.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.920]   - And are there certain states where you're better off,
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.560]   like in a high-tech state like California, New York,
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.480]   you're better off with muni bonds, technically?
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.740]   - Yeah, I mean, I think so.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.000]   And there are certain time periods
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.320]   when that's true and it's not.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.240]   And I think right now, there's some harmony,
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.120]   but certainly like back in 2017,
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.800]   we saw yields on municipals like nationally about 3%.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.480]   And a 10-year treasury would get you somewhere around two.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.440]   And so if I'm a high-income taxpayer, you're exactly right.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.600]   If I'm in New York, if I'm in New York City,
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.160]   and I'm paying 14% of my income tax to the state level
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.520]   in addition to the federal,
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.320]   and I buy a New York bond, right?
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.440]   So that's part of the problem
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   is you need to sort of look in state
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.080]   to get that state, that triple tax exemption
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.680]   at the federal, state, and local level.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.520]   That can save a taxpayer a lot, as much as 50% on that side.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.880]   And so if I can keep all of my 3% yield,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.760]   the tax-adjusted yield on that,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.080]   assuming a 50% tax rate, is actually 6%.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.960]   And so if I'm out there, my choices are 6% out there,
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.720]   a 3% municipal, that's equivalent.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.680]   But if my choice is three or three,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.360]   I'm much better off the municipal bond.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.960]   Again, assuming this is a non-qualified account.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.400]   This doesn't apply to IRAs, 401(k)s.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.080]   - Right, and I think getting to the point
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.960]   where people become concerned,
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.960]   and I think in recent years, especially after 2008,
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.640]   people were worried, well, if I buy these muni bonds
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.480]   and my tax or my state or city defaults, I'm screwed.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.560]   I think actually at this point,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.640]   you have to feel a little better about them
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.600]   'cause all the states and municipalities
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.320]   seem to be in better shape because of the pandemic,
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.080]   all the fiscal support that they got.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.920]   - Yeah, I agree. - They're coming out
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.160]   of this thing better than they were before, right?
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.720]   - Yeah, and you're seeing retail sales rebound, et cetera.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.400]   It's important when you're looking at these things,
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.840]   assuming you are looking at individual bonds,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.920]   there are two real types.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.120]   One is GO, general obligation,
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.960]   and that's exactly, Ben, what you're talking about.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.600]   That's generally supported by the revenue,
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.360]   sales taxes, mortgage taxes, et cetera,
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.680]   of your local municipality.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.600]   However, there's another type of bond,
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.160]   a sort of special purpose bond
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.440]   that's tied to a revenue source.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.960]   So where I live, I'm about 10, 12 miles
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.320]   from the New York State Thruway.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.080]   The Thruway collects tolls, and New York State sells bonds.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.320]   The Thruway Authority sells bonds
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.000]   that are supported by those tolls.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.240]   Pros and cons of each, you have to evaluate them.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.360]   We have a third-party manager do that for us,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.960]   and they're great at it.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.720]   But very generally, I think it's a great consideration
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.680]   if you're a high-income taxpayer,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.120]   if you're looking for a way to pick up a little bit of yield.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.400]   I think they're a great complement to other fixed income.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.000]   - And I agree that you want a funder or professional
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.200]   doing this, 'cause they're liquid,
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.240]   they're hard to understand.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.480]   Buying bonds, you know, is not easy.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.400]   Duncan, next question.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.360]   We got one more.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.960]   - Okay.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   So our last question is I'm 46 years old,
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.380]   and I want to be financially able to retire at 55,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.920]   but won't be able to until I'm 62.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.320]   In 2015, I opened a TD account and took $50,000
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   and bought 100 shares of Google.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.480]   Last summer, I took another 401(k) account that I had
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.000]   to move since I was changing jobs
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.960]   and bought $20,000 of CrowdStrike.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.760]   Thanks, Josh, they put.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.120]   These are my retirement investments,
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.400]   $350,000 in a Target Date Fund,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.240]   and a 401(k), 35(k), and a 403(b) Target Date Fund,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.480]   100 shares of Google, 175 shares of CrowdStrike.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.040]   My concern is that I have about $700,000
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.560]   in 403(b)/401(k), with half being in two stocks.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.200]   At what point do I need to redistribute
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.860]   my retirement accounts?
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.700]   - Great question.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.520]   Let's bring Michael back in here, too,
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.000]   'cause this is something we deal with a lot,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.200]   and Michael, I know, has dealt with this, too,
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.800]   on our direct indexing platform.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.540]   - Very common question.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.620]   - Yeah, this is, and I guess, so this is the whole thing,
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.120]   like, yeah, you concentrate to get rich,
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.220]   but you diversify to stay rich.
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.000]   So I think people know they need to do this at some point,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.480]   but, Michael, you've talked to a lot of clients, too,
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.440]   on this, that they go, well, I don't want to sell early.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.240]   What if it keeps going up, right?
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.160]   So it's like, how do you work through this decision
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   when someone knows they have to diversify,
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.400]   but they have potential tax implications,
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.440]   and then they also have potential regret
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.260]   that comes from this?
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.080]   So two things I'll say.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.240]   One is a nice framework to work through this
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.600]   is regret minimization.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.440]   You're obviously not gonna sell at the top, right?
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   Probably not.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.800]   So what feels worse is that you start to sell,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.240]   and the stock continues higher without you.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.360]   Yeah, it sucks.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.280]   Or you decide not to sell, and the stock drops.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.080]   You're gonna feel like an absolute asshole.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.520]   Like, in my opinion, this is an easy decision.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.480]   But it's not an easy decision,
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.320]   because Google and CrowdStrike,
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.800]   and ostensibly any other stock that somebody's asking about
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.220]   that they're having difficulty parting ways with,
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.960]   has done incredibly well,
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.560]   so they feel some sort of affinity to it, as they should,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.480]   and they're worried that, A,
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.000]   what are they gonna put their money into?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.280]   What's gonna do better than Google?
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.360]   What's gonna do better than CrowdStrike,
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.000]   or pick your stock?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   But to me, the risks are asymmetric to the downside.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.160]   This is very clear.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.720]   So, okay, if you're wrong,
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.200]   listen, it's not gonna feel good.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.060]   But there's too much on the line to tie your future
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.640]   to the fate of two stocks.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.800]   I don't care what stocks they are,
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.760]   'cause for every Tesla and CrowdStrike and Google,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.640]   there are millions that have met the dustbin.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.440]   - There's also a certain point where I'm gonna say,
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.280]   you kind of already won
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.040]   because you picked these stocks when you did.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.880]   You've done great.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.720]   If they keep doing well, that's too bad.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.280]   But Bill, what do you think about the tax implications
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.120]   of this?
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.940]   'Cause it sounds like these are in taxable accounts,
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.500]   so you've got big gains you're dealing with.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.440]   How do you think about that?
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.360]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.560]   But to echo your point,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.360]   if you've won the game, stop playing.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.600]   So that's number one.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.920]   That said, this client is nowhere near retirement,
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.780]   this listener.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.280]   And so, if that's the case,
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.440]   it's not an all-or-none thing.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.300]   Taxes are a big consideration.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.480]   And so, if you've held those stocks for less than a year,
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.360]   you're looking at short-term capital gains.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.440]   I'm not interested in that.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.040]   I don't think people are generally.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.240]   So I definitely wait a year,
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.760]   but my advice would be it doesn't need to be all-or-none.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.520]   And so, if a tax strategy might be,
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.840]   let's look at the tax brackets.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.760]   When do I hit the next capital gains tax bracket?
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.260]   Am I earning less than $52,000?
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.520]   Therefore, some of my capital gains might be at 0%.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.360]   Maybe use the tax code as a way to sort of solve
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.480]   for the behavioral problem that Michael indicates.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.280]   And it doesn't have to be all-or-none,
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.780]   but this listener needs a plan.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.800]   You gotta get out of those stocks.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.380]   You gotta diversify.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.000]   If not now, when?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.080]   - And one of the ways we do this, right,
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.120]   is sometimes we do people,
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.720]   it's like the opposite of dollar-cost averaging.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.440]   We leg them out of the position instead of legging in.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.600]   So it takes a while, right?
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.360]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.200]   - I just wanted to add,
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.000]   didn't one of you on a recent Animals Period
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.960]   say something about the percentage of stocks
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.680]   that are down every year?
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.760]   - It's like 30%.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.600]   - Yeah, so it's--
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.680]   - Even in an up year, there's stocks that get,
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.960]   we've learned in the last few weeks,
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.840]   there's stocks that get crushed even during a good market.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.520]   - And there's that great longboard asset management study
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.160]   that shows that something like 90% go to zero,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.040]   not all at once, right, but over time.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.600]   Think about the S&P 500 of 50 years ago.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.960]   How many of those stocks survived today?
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.000]   What is the, what's the survivorship rate?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.160]   - I don't know what those numbers are,
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.380]   but 2/3 of every stock underperforms the index.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.220]   - Right.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.040]   - Crazy.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.280]   - And the ones that do outperform give, you know,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.080]   typically do so with a very bumpy ride
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.720]   that you don't need to expose yourself to.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.120]   - Diversify or die, listener.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.400]   - Yes, it's unfortunate.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.440]   You give up the home runs,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.120]   but yeah, you're preventing yourself from the strikeout.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.480]   Okay. - Yep.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.880]   - Anyone have any thoughts today?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.960]   I know we have some people in the live stream.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.320]   Leave us a comment.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.000]   Michael's ego is a little too fragile to read the comments.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.120]   I still read them. - Sure.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.800]   - Right, it's okay.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.760]   But I sent him the good ones that you wrote about him.
