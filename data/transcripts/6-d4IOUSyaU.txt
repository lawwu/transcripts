[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.040]   are to be found in that chapter that we read at the beginning,
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.440]   namely the fourth chapter of the Epistle of James,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.360]   with special reference to verses 13 to 16.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:27.400]   From verse 13 to verse 16 in the fourth chapter of the Epistle of James.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.160]   "Go to know ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.520]   and continue there a year, and buy and sell and get gain;
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.640]   whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.440]   For what is your life?
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.960]   It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.000]   and then vanisheth away; for that ye ought to say,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.880]   If the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:20.120]   But now ye rejoice in your boastings; all such rejoicing is evil."
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.080]   I find it extremely difficult to understand anybody
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.040]   who does not believe that this book which we call the Bible
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.520]   is the Word of God.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.920]   I find it very difficult to understand such a person for many, many reasons.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.840]   But there are three particular reasons
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.040]   which seem to me to be sufficient in and of themselves
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.480]   to make it plain to any thoughtful, thinking, intelligent person
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.960]   that this is none other than the Word of God.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.280]   That it isn't merely a collection of human writings,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.080]   the theories and philosophies and ideas of men,
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.720]   but rather the Word of God, the living God to men.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.840]   Now, the reasons that are particularly in my mind this evening are these.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.200]   The first is that the Bible always seems to have the perfect word
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.840]   and the only appropriate word to say
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.040]   whatever may happen to us in this life and in this world.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.160]   There is nothing that can happen to us individually or collectively
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.600]   but that we will find somewhere or another
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.680]   the Bible has the perfect comment to make upon it.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.360]   I'm making my statement deliberately. It doesn't matter I say what may happen to us.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.640]   You will always find the appropriate comment here.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.800]   Because, after all, the real test of our ultimate intelligence is
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.400]   our reactions to what happened and our comments upon what happened.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.280]   That's the way we test ourselves. That's the way we can test one another.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.520]   What does a man say when he hears certain things?
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.160]   What's his reaction to it?
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.760]   Does he just try to forget it, dismiss it because it's unpleasant?
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.880]   Or does he just make some trite, obvious remark?
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.040]   Or does he, looking at the thing and seeing it profoundly
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.240]   and its ultimate meaning and significance,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.640]   say something that is of value to our soul?
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.320]   Now, I say the Bible always has the appropriate comment,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.440]   the right thing to say, in the light of any event or incident
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.600]   that may happen to take place in our individual lives or in our common lives together.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.280]   And that seems to me, in and of itself, had we no other reasons at all
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.680]   for establishing the fact that this is God's Word
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.120]   and God's comment upon life and upon all that happens to us.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.720]   But let me give you a second reason.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.560]   And my second reason is this.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:31.480]   That the Bible's description of men is always up to date.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.160]   You see, it's a very old book, this,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.400]   written at different times over a number of centuries,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   and the last book written in the first century, so long ago.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.920]   And it's always telling us things about men.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.840]   Its whole theme is, in a sense, men and his relationship to God.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   But this is the astounding thing,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.320]   that it doesn't matter what part of the Bible you turn to,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.760]   and you read what it's got to say about men,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.800]   and you'll find it's always true,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.880]   always contemporary, always up to date.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.880]   Proving, it seems to me, thereby, the Bible's own contention,
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.760]   that the fundamental thing about men is his relationship to God.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.400]   And that if that isn't right,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.440]   well, then it doesn't really matter what happens to him in any other respect.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.480]   Finally, everything is all wrong.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.760]   Now that is a great statement which you'll find everywhere in the Bible.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.200]   You go through it, pick out what it's got to say about men,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.520]   and you'll find that it's equally true about men today.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.160]   Now there's only one explanation of this.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.000]   And that is, you see, that in spite of all the superficial changes in life
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.120]   that have taken place throughout the running centuries,
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.320]   that men as men hasn't changed at all.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.080]   And the Bible says that he does not.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.200]   The Bible says the important thing about men is not how he dresses,
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.400]   not how he speaks, not whether he travels on foot or in an aeroplane,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.160]   or in a rocket, or anything else.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.280]   The fundamental thing about men, it says, is this, is his relationship to God.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.840]   And though he may change in these other respects,
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.040]   this is the thing that determines what's true about men.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.440]   So what it has to say about men centuries ago is as true tonight,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.160]   as it was when it was first written.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.840]   Now there again, surely, is another thing that ought to convince us
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.000]   that this is the word of God.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.120]   Because apart from this book, you've had many different ideas
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.400]   with regard to men and the nature of men, and the whole condition of men.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.960]   They change, there are fashions, they change from century to century.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.400]   And if you pick up an old book and read what it has got to say about men,
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.320]   and then you look at modern men, you say, "What a tremendous difference."
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.320]   You never feel that when you're reading this book.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.000]   It doesn't matter where you happen to chance upon its description of men,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.400]   like that which we are looking at together tonight.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.120]   There at once, I say, you're looking at a typical representative modern man.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.400]   It knows men, and it's got its finger on this central truth about men.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.200]   And that brings me to my third comment, which is this,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   that surely the constant assertion which the Bible makes about men
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   ought to convince us that it's the word of God.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.880]   And what is that assertion? Well, it's this,
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.200]   that the thing that finally accounts for all man's troubles
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.000]   is his foolish pride.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.760]   Man's real trouble is his pride.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.880]   Now, the Bible tells you that at the beginning of the book of Genesis,
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.360]   and it goes on saying it from beginning to end.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.880]   Man finds himself in a world of troubles, things happen to him.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.960]   He's always involved in these trials and tribulations and difficulties.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.360]   Why is he like this? What's the matter?
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.280]   The Bible says there's only one answer.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.200]   It's man's foolish pride.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.680]   It's the thing that brought him down.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.760]   It's the thing that has kept him down ever since.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.600]   Very well, there I say three things without going any further,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.320]   which surely ought to make us see that when we are looking into this book
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.720]   and considering its message, we are not listening to a human comment
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.160]   upon men and upon life, but to the comment of God himself.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.240]   This is the word of God.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.320]   Now then, let me show you how all that is illustrated in these verses
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.000]   that we are looking at together this evening.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.800]   My subject divides itself up quite simply.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:06.280]   And you know, my friends, I've come into this pulpit tonight with a feeling
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.760]   that there is something which is preaching in a way that I can never preach.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.160]   And that is something that's happened during this past week.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.800]   All I'm anxious to do is that you all hear that sermon,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.920]   that we all hear the voice of God speaking to us through that event.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.600]   Well, now let me put it to you in this form by expounding these particular verses.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.000]   Two things I said here.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.880]   First of all, man's view of himself.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.920]   Secondly, the true view of men.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.240]   That's all it is.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.160]   I could say that, couldn't I, about any text in the Bible.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.120]   You can always use that as a division of a text.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.640]   Man's view of himself, the truth about men.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.000]   Now look at them.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.320]   Take first man's view of himself.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.280]   Now here, James puts it very perfectly in the 16th verse.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.680]   Here's the key.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:16.600]   "But now," he says, "you rejoice in your boasting."
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.320]   I said the Bible is always contemporary in what it says about men.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.040]   That's what a man wrote, you see, in the first century.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.360]   And this is the 20th century.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.720]   James says, "You are rejoicing in your boasting."
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.480]   Can you imagine a more perfect statement about modern men?
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.120]   "Rejoice in your boasting."
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.880]   Do you prefer another translation?
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.080]   Listen to this.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.040]   "You boast in your arrogance."
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.880]   That's the revised standard version.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.240]   "You are boasting in your arrogance."
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.680]   Or I can give you still another translation.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:01.080]   "You rejoice," says this authorized translation, "in your boastings."
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.360]   "You rejoice," we might say, "in your pride of life."
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.280]   Because it's exactly the same word.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.320]   In the first epistle of John, in the second chapter,
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.720]   you will find that it's put there like this.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:21.160]   We read about the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye, and the pride of life.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.920]   It's exactly the same word as is translated here, "boastings."
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:33.720]   "You boast or exult in your pride of life."
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.440]   Can you, I ask again, suggest to me a more accurate description
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.160]   of the average, typical, modern men?
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.240]   The men, I mean, who's not interested in the Bible, who laughs at it, and scouts it.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.680]   Who doesn't, he's not a Christian, doesn't believe in God, he's not religious.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.120]   The typical, modern men.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.880]   There he is, rejoicing in his boastings, glorying in his pride of life.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.680]   What does it mean?
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.120]   Well, it means this.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.240]   He maintains that he has surveyed life.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.920]   He's a man who's got gifts, he's got a great brain, great intellect,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.600]   and he's had the great advantage of education and learning.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.440]   He's so fortunate to have lived in the 20th century.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:26.360]   People didn't have these advantages before, but he's a man of the 20th century.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:32.440]   And after all, life has moved and advanced, and the world is going forward.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.960]   And here is this highly intelligent creature, who has had all these educational advantages,
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.400]   and has all this great knowledge at his dispersal.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.600]   And as a result of this, he has surveyed life.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.160]   And he has worked out for himself a philosophy of life.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:57.480]   He's evolved a view of life, and he's very pleased with it.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.200]   He's proud of himself, he's proud of his brain, he's proud of his intellect,
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:08.760]   he's proud of his knowledge, he's proud of his tremendous, indeed staggering achievements.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.240]   And of course, they are very great.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.320]   Let nobody misunderstand me.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.680]   The achievements of this present century have been phenomenal.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:22.600]   The amazing discoveries that have taken place in the realm of science, in all its branches,
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.400]   it is indeed quite remarkable and astounding.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.160]   And the modern man looks at all this, and he contemplates it all
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.200]   with great satisfaction and great pride.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.800]   You rejoice in your boasting.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:42.360]   And that, I think you will agree with me, is the boast of the modern man.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:50.600]   That after all, we at last have succeeded in understanding life.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.000]   We are no longer primitive.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.520]   We are no longer the creatures of fears.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.000]   We have arrived at an adult condition.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.200]   And here man feels that he really is competent to order his own life,
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.720]   and to plan his own existence.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   No longer is any God necessary.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.520]   Man, after all, has now arrived and is able to do these things for himself.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:24.040]   He rejoices, he boasts in his pride of life, and he says without any hesitation,
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.880]   "I am the master of my fate.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.840]   I am the captain of my soul."
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.600]   He has looked into it all, and with his great capacity and with his great powers,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.320]   he thus, I say, has got it all mapped.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.440]   He rarely does know.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.000]   Now, I think you'll agree that I'm not being unfair.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.640]   God forbid that I should.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.040]   I am making my statements on my knowledge of men and women,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.120]   on my reading of the newspapers and the journals and the books,
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:06.920]   and I suggest to you that I'm just giving the description of modern man's view of life.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.320]   He really is proud of himself, and proud of his life,
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.880]   and proud of the fact that he's a man who's living in the 20th century,
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.280]   who has thus mastered life.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:24.120]   Well, the result of this is, you see, something that shows itself in two main respects,
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.960]   which James puts before us here.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:33.240]   Holding this view of himself and his powers and of life,
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:42.760]   the modern man plans his life with confidence, with assurance, and with certainty.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.880]   He says, "Today, or tomorrow, or today and tomorrow,
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.360]   we will go into such a city and continue there a year,
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:16:01.160]   and we'll buy and sell and get gay."
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.320]   Oh, we all know about this, don't we? We've all done it ourselves.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.000]   We make our plans, we decide what we're going to do,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.920]   we work out our program, we may even commit it to paper.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:20.280]   There are no reservations, no hesitations at all,
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.400]   no possibilities of contingencies considered.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.320]   Of course not. Life has become so organized, and we know so much about it today.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.280]   Modern man acts as if he'd got an endless lease on life.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.120]   He never even stops to consider that that may be wrong.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.960]   He goes on from day to day without a single thought
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.840]   as to whether conceivably he's wrong in that view.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:52.280]   He acts on the assumption that he's here forever, he's got an endless lease on life.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:59.000]   And he therefore makes his plans, puts forward his proposals.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.120]   "Tomorrow I'm going to do this, the day after I'm going to do that,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.600]   and I'm indeed going to do this for a whole year,
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:09.720]   and I've decided exactly how my life is going to be spent."
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.440]   Isn't that it?
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:19.720]   How often do you hear people saying, "God willing?"
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   How often do you hear people saying, "If the Lord will."
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.840]   How often do they say, "Even today I hope to do so-and-so, I am going to do so-and-so."
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:34.840]   That's it. Life has become mastered by men, and he doesn't hesitate, I say,
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:40.760]   to look right into the future, and he tells us what he's going to do.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.040]   And the other respect, of course, in which it works out is this,
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:54.120]   that the modern man is very confident that he knows what is best for himself,
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:18:00.200]   and that he knows what is real gain. It's all in that one verse, the 13th.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.000]   "Go to now ye that say, today or tomorrow we will go into such a city,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.400]   and continue there a year, and buy and sell and get gain."
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.120]   This is the thing that really does appeal to the modern man.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.560]   He's interested in gain.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.160]   He believes, and he prides himself, I say, particularly on this,
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.160]   that he really knows what is best for himself.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.120]   He thinks he knows what he wants, and what he wants, of course, is the best.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.800]   He knows what will give him pleasure, and what will give him joy,
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   and what will give him great gain.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.720]   He's not the sort of man who's interested in pie in the sky, as he calls it.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.840]   No, no. He wants to make the best of this world,
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.360]   and he knows what's good in this life, and in this world.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.480]   He's a practical, hard-headed man of affairs. There are no illusions about him.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.240]   He's out for gain, frankly. He wants money,
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.600]   because with money you can get your food, and your drink, and your pleasure.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.920]   You can run your car, and you can have a wonderful house.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.320]   You can do this and that. He's purely materialistic.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.120]   Gain, that's the thing. Settle down in this life, and in this world.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.320]   Look after yourself. Do the best you can for yourself.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.160]   Get this gain, which really makes life worth living.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.760]   Gain is the thing. If you've got money, why, you can get anything.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.960]   Given money, why, there's nothing that can stand before you.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.240]   Life depends upon gain, possessions.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:35.720]   I ask again, am I being unfair?
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:43.320]   Is this a caricature? Well, you see, the point I'm making all along,
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.480]   is that James said all this in the first century, and this is the 20th century.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.720]   Men were like that then, men are like that now, men have always been like that.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:20:01.240]   And it all, you see, is a manifestation of this exulting and bursting in our pride of life.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:10.120]   Thus, man thinks that whatever his faults and deficiencies may be,
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.080]   at any rate, is always looking after himself. Look after number one, he says.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:21.160]   I'm all right. I've got it all planned. I've worked it out.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.000]   Today and tomorrow, for 12 months, I'm going to do well.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.040]   I'm looking ahead. I'm not a fool. I'm laying down my plans.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.720]   I've got it all under control, and I'm going to do this.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.000]   And it's going to be marvelous, it's going to be wonderful.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.200]   I'm going to get great gain. So, men, boasting, rejoicing in his boastings,
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:55.720]   looks ahead and lays down his plans, and congratulates himself in an anticipatory manner
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:01.560]   on the great gain that he's going to get out of it all, and the wonderful life he's going to live.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:07.000]   Very well. There is men, as he looks at himself. That is men's view of himself.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.640]   That's men's view of men. But now, let us look at the truth about men.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:19.000]   And what does the Bible say about him? What is the truth about men?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.680]   It's all stated here perfectly. Do you know the terrible thing about us all by nature is this,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:33.880]   that we are just fools. Fools. Is that too strong a term? Well, let me substantiate it.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:42.280]   Why do I say that man is a fool? Well, I say so for this reason,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.480]   that here he is so proud of himself and proud of his knowledge,
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:58.600]   whereas in reality, he is ignorant of the primary and elementary things, the first thing.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:07.720]   And at the same time, he is ignorant and tragically ignorant of the things that are
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.360]   most important. Now, that is the thing that I've got to work out with you.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.200]   Modern men doesn't see that. He didn't see it in the days of James.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.280]   This seems to me to be the whole essence of the modern folly,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.320]   and I don't hesitate to repeat that it is a tragedy.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:31.240]   Men is boasting, I say, of his great knowledge, and in a sense, he has a right to do so,
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.680]   because his knowledge is truly remarkable. Yes, but he shouldn't be boasting about it as he does.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.040]   Why? Well, because he's so ignorant about the primary things.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.680]   It's very difficult to think of the appropriate illustration.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:52.040]   Shall I give you the illustration, which you yourselves perhaps provide?
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:59.400]   There is no joke that is made so frequently at the expense of the medical profession than just this.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:09.720]   Ha, says the layman, the medical profession, with all its boasting about its penicillin and its
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:16.440]   wonderful operations, how they can keep a man alive for such a long time when they're actually
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:21.400]   operating on his heart, as it were, almost take the heart out of circulation and keep the men's
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.360]   circulation going. These miracle operations they're doing, and all their miracle drugs,
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.480]   and how they can cure all sorts of diseases. Very wonderful, says the modern layman,
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.800]   but you can't cure the modern common cold.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.480]   And what's the value of all your boastings when you can't cure the common cold?
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:45.400]   Now that's it, isn't it? And there is something rather ridiculous about it, isn't there?
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.240]   That we can do these wonderful things and we can't do the ordinary things.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:55.320]   Now men, in general, is just like that at the present time. Here he is, contemplating his
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.640]   astounding achievements, the results of scientific advance, all he can do in an experimental manner,
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.600]   and then, like a fool, he on the basis of that says, "I'm marvelous, I'm perfect,
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:13.560]   I've got my life under control." But you haven't. He is pathetically ignorant,
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:19.800]   and about the primary things, the fundamental things, above all the most important and the
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.680]   most vital things of all, what are they? Well, listen to the list that is given by James.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:32.920]   Here is a man who knows so much. What's he ignorant of? He's ignorant of tomorrow.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.400]   He says what he's going to do in a year's time, but he knows nothing about tomorrow.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:47.800]   "Go to, ye that say, today or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.200]   and buy and sell and get grain," whereas you know not what shall be on tomorrow.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:25:01.240]   Here is modern men, I say, looking ahead and preparing and planning.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.880]   In a sense, there's nothing wrong in that. It is but right that a man should look ahead
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.840]   and make preparations in a certain sense. Yes, but, my dear friend, the way in which
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.920]   you and I do that is tremendously important. As James reminds us, we ought to say, "If the Lord
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.640]   will, we shall live and do this or that," but we don't do that. You see, we leave that out,
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:29.960]   and we say, "Now I'm going to do this." We lay down our plans dogmatically and definitely,
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:38.040]   and without any reservations, and we calmly say, "Now tomorrow I'm going to do this or that."
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:45.080]   And then tomorrow comes,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.920]   and whoever imagined or thought for a moment
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:03.240]   that what happened on that morrow was going to happen. Think of people who sat down in their
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:09.720]   homes and said, "Now tomorrow and the day after, I'm going to do this or that," and tomorrow came.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:19.800]   And you know what happened? It was their last day on earth, tomorrow.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:29.640]   We know nothing about tomorrow. Man, with all his cleverness and all his ability to
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   send up his rockets into that outer atmosphere, he knows nothing about tomorrow.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   Oh, I'm not saying anything about sending up your rockets. Let science boast of her achievements.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.960]   Yes, but don't be a fool and say that because you can do that you know everything,
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.400]   and you know all about life, because you don't. You don't know about tomorrow.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.440]   Men is ignorant about tomorrow.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:00.200]   Oh yes, and not only tomorrow and the day after,
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:06.280]   but how ignorant is man about that endless tomorrow.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:14.680]   For man goes on, you see, and life goes on, and the soul goes on, and there is an endless
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:20.520]   tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and on and on it goes to all eternity.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.440]   And what does modern men know about it?
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:32.840]   Here he is bursting, rejoicing in his burstings, exulting in his pride of life,
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.160]   and saying, "Am I not wonderful, and isn't my life wonderful as I've planned it?"
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:44.680]   And he knows nothing about tomorrow, and all the tomorrows and tomorrows
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:54.120]   that will constitute eternity, that endless existence, that going on, and on, and on.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:00.440]   He knows nothing about it. And yet, you see, he will not stop to consider this.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:06.120]   He gets up and he says dogmatically, based upon his philosophy of his life,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.800]   "Today and tomorrow I am going to, and for all twelve months."
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.720]   Isn't this sheer lunacy? Oh, the folly of it all!
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:25.320]   But he's not only ignorant of tomorrow, he is ignorant of the nature of his own life.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:32.200]   James puts this as a question, but it's really his way of making an assertion. He says,
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   "What is your life?" You know all about science. Do you know what your life is?
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:49.640]   With all your consideration and your planning and your thinking ahead, tell me, says James,
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:55.560]   have you thought about your own life? What is your life? What is it?
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.200]   Now, my dear friends, let me just, I'm here simply tonight to put some simple and plain
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:05.160]   questions to you. I say they are questions that are being asked by a voice infinitely
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.400]   more powerful than mine. Haven't you been asking yourself the last few days,
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.640]   "What is my life?" If you haven't, I say you're a fool.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:21.720]   If you can have lived since last Tuesday without asking yourself, "What is my life?"
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:28.280]   then you're completely unintelligent. Though you may know all about science and you're boasting
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:36.280]   about these marvelous researches of men. "The eyes of the fool," says the Old Testament,
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:41.160]   "are on the ends of the earth." I'm inviting you to come back onto your own doorstep this evening.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:46.280]   Forget all about science for a moment before you begin to think about things like that.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.160]   What about your life? What is your life? What does man know about life? And the answer is,
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:58.280]   "Your life is nothing but a vapor that appears for a little season and then vanishes away."
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:06.040]   There's something almost incredible about this, isn't there?
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:14.120]   You'd have thought that every one of us, in view of what we read in our papers from time to time
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:19.960]   and what we hear, you'd have thought that we'd all be perfectly clear about this,
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.920]   that that is the true description of our life in this world. It's but a vapor.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:32.440]   What is he referring to? Well, he is just emphasizing the passing and the ephemeral
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:41.720]   nature of life. It's absolute frailty, like a puff of air, like a breath.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.720]   Oh, our lives in this world are so frail. They're at the mercy of so many things that
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:56.760]   can happen to them. You see, the very processes of life itself, they're so delicately balanced.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.520]   It's almost an amazing thing that we can go on living at all,
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:06.200]   and we are aging and the processes are developing. We're at the mercy of these things.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:12.680]   At any moment, something can go wrong with us functionally.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:21.240]   Have you stopped to consider that? What a delicate balance there is in the life of every one of us.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:30.360]   Personally speaking, the main effect that the study of anatomy and physiology had upon me
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   was to make me be filled with amazement that we live at all.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:42.120]   You'd have thought that if a man bends suddenly, it'd be enough to put something out of gear,
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.480]   but we are so delicately balanced, it's a fine adjustment. Yes,
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:51.800]   but at any moment something can go wrong. And then think of disease.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:32:00.840]   You never know when it's coming. "Oh, but sir someone, this is being morbid." It's not being
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:07.400]   morbid, it's being realistic. And if you don't like facing facts, there's only one thing to say
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:13.000]   about you, that is, again, you're a fool. And it's no use claiming that you're a modern man,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.960]   and that you think, and that you use your brain, and that you're scientific, if you don't look at
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.320]   facts because they're unpleasant. The business of the scientist is to look at all the facts that
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:29.000]   are there, whether he likes them or not. And here is one of the great facts. The frailty of life,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.920]   disease, these little germs, ultramicroscopic. This church is probably full of them at this
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:40.200]   moment. These viruses can suddenly enter and grip you. Poliomyelitis.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:48.680]   Only the other evening a lady came in to me to tell me
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:55.480]   that her husband, a young man, the father of two little children,
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:02.200]   had suddenly had that fell polio, and that he was dead and buried. They came here regularly.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:08.440]   Thank God he was ready to go. But such, you see, is the frailty of life. Taken suddenly ill.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:14.280]   Diagnosis influenza. The next day, obviously it wasn't. Rushed into hospital. Lung,
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:21.640]   chest paralyzed. Artificial lung. Everything that science can do, but no good.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:29.400]   The frailty of life, my dear friend, what is your life? It's but a vapor.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:37.240]   Oh, let me add the other thing. Accident. Accident.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:43.320]   You go out of your house in the morning saying, "Today and tomorrow I'm going to do this."
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:53.560]   Accident. There is no tomorrow for you. It's the end. Oh, I'm just trying to say this,
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:34:01.080]   that this life of ours is frail, it's tenuous, it's like a little silken cord, and at any moment
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.760]   it may snap and break. The certainty of death is the greatest certainty of all, and yet modern men
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:11.880]   won't face it. That's why I say he's a fool. He says, "Today and tomorrow." He doesn't consider
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:20.360]   death the absolute certainty of death. And coupled with the absolute certainty of death,
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:27.400]   the uncertainty as to when it's going to happen. Put those two together. It's the most amazing
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:33.160]   thing of all, that any man can miss it. Death is certain, the moment of death is uncertain,
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:39.640]   and yet we say, "Today and tomorrow, the next twelve months." Go to, says James.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:47.800]   Don't be fools. Stop and consider what is your life. Modern men, with all his bursting,
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.760]   is ignorant of his life and its real nature.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:57.640]   And the next thing that he's ignorant, of course, of is this,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.920]   is of the Lord and his absolute sovereignty.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:12.760]   For that he ought to say, "If the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.200]   But he doesn't think of the Lord. He doesn't know about the Lord.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:26.280]   He's a scientist. He's a materialist. He listens to the brain's trust. "There isn't a God,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:32.520]   therefore I can say this and that." And the Lord is forgotten, but the Lord is there.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:43.560]   And our times are in the hands of the Lord, and we are all of us in his hands.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:51.400]   It is he who made the world and set the time process going. He disposes of everything and
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.760]   he controls everything. He's at the back of the sun and the moon and the stars and the rain and
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:03.800]   the sunshine. He's the God of providence. He's the God that is over all and rules over all.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.880]   But the modern man is ignorant of this. He doesn't know what I read in the sixth verse,
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:19.400]   "Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:24.920]   He doesn't know about that. He doesn't realize that. He doesn't know what we are told in verse
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:37.880]   12. There is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy. "Who art thou that judgest another?"
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:49.160]   In other words, what the modern man is ignorant of is this, that God is, that he is over all,
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:57.480]   that he is judge of all the earth, that he can end our life at any moment in spite of science
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:04.200]   and everything else, that it's all absolutely utterly in his hands, and that when we die we
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:12.040]   go on to judgment and to meet and to face God, and that he is a just and a righteous and a holy God.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:21.560]   God resisteth the proud. And here is modern man rejoicing in his boastings, proud of his pride of
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:28.440]   life. And he doesn't know that this God under whose hand he is resists such a person, and is against
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:33.320]   such a being, and his wrath is against such a being. The modern man is ignorant of that.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:41.720]   And thus he makes his boastful statements, and thus he proposes and plans, and suddenly disaster
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.680]   comes, and he's bewildered and doesn't know where he is. He is ignorant of the Lord.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:38:01.160]   And finally he is ignorant of true gain. He thinks he knows all about gain. "Today and
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:07.320]   tomorrow we shall go into such a city, and trade there, and continue a year, and buy and sell,
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:14.280]   and get gain. Marvelous!" he says. But what's his conception of gain? As I told you, it's purely
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:24.680]   materialistic. Possessions, money, goods, things, houses, cars, pleasure, enjoyment, these are his
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:32.040]   ideas of gain. Yes, but he doesn't realize that moth and rust can corrupt all these, and eat into
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:38.600]   them, and destroy them, and that finally when he comes to die, he leaves them all behind, and is
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.320]   left empty-handed. Though he may have been a millionaire, the accident happens, he's got
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:50.600]   nothing. He goes empty-handed, and as a naked soul, face to face with his God and his judge
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:57.960]   eternal. That's what the modern man doesn't know, as men did not know it in the time of James.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:13.200]   Oh, but this is a tragedy. If men but knew what is real gain. What is real gain? Well, I'll tell
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:24.080]   you. It is the life of the soul. Not the life of the body, but the life of the soul. Gain, dear,
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:29.280]   are you interested in gain? The modern man is. He wants to get on. He wants to know the best people.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.440]   Wants to get into the best clubs. Wants to be presented to the Queen. He wants to get on, and to
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:41.800]   know people. He thinks that's gain. Oh, if you're interested in gain, I'll tell you what gain is. To
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:53.720]   know God. To be a friend of God. To have fellowship with God. But how can a man have fellowship with
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:03.520]   God? Well, this is the answer. Though we are all fools by nature, and of all sinned against God,
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:12.840]   and deserve nothing but his wrath, and though he resists us in our pride, you remember what we are
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:22.760]   told, "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Draw nigh unto God. Humble yourselves in the sight of
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:29.560]   the Lord, and he shall lift you up." That's the marvelous thing. In other words, this is gain.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:35.600]   That a man comes to see his folly, the precarious condition of his life. That his life is but a
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:41.080]   vapor. He awakens to it all. He sees he's been a fool. That he's under the wrath of God. He says,
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.600]   "What can I do? What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:55.680]   And suddenly he meets this word, "Humble yourselves unto the mighty hand of God." Which means go to
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:01.640]   God and acknowledge, and confess your sin. Tell him that you've been arrogant, and proud, and
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.480]   boastful. That you've said, "Today and tomorrow." And you haven't thought of God. And you've sinned
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.520]   against him. Confess it. Get down before him. Humble yourself. Abase yourself. Put on sackcloth
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:20.880]   and ashes. Metaphorically speaking, ask him to have mercy upon you. And wonder of wonders this
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:29.320]   is what will happen. "Humble yourselves in the sight of God, and he will lift you up." Go to him
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:35.920]   and acknowledge and confess your sins. And he will tell you whatever you've been, whatever you've
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:42.640]   done. That he has so loved you with an everlasting love, that he sent his only son into the world to
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:49.880]   rescue you and redeem you. That he put your sins on his son, and smote him, and punished your sins
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:58.320]   in him. And offers you a free pardon, and a free forgiveness. Gain, that's gain. Forgiveness for
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:11.840]   nothing. Reconciliation unto God, without money and without price. And thus I say, being reconciled,
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:23.320]   you begin to enjoy life with God. Life of the soul. Life of the spirit. You begin to receive
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:31.360]   God's blessings. You begin to see that there's nothing in the world that is comparable to
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:41.920]   holiness and sanctity and truth. You would prefer to be a pauper, and yet a holy man in communion
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:50.000]   with God, than the richest man in the whole world without God. Purity and cleanliness, the joy of
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.480]   the Lord and his salvation. Manifestations of heaven while you're still on earth. Four tastes
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:02.560]   of glory while still in this world of time. The death, death and the fear of death have gone and
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:07.800]   are banished. You say, "It doesn't matter what happens to me. I can never be separated from the
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:20.520]   love of God." That's gain that is true riches. And then the certain knowledge that after death,
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:29.960]   when you've left this world and all its things behind you, you go to be with God and with Christ.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:39.640]   You enter into an inheritance that is incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away. There are
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   no accidents there. There are no sorrow and crying and dying there. The mightiest bombs of men can't
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:54.480]   touch that. Let hell be let loose. You're safe there. Incorruptible and undefiled and that
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:02.160]   fadeth not away. Reserved in heaven by God for them that love him. You know you're going to it.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:13.160]   So that you're no longer troubled and frightened at the fact that your life is a vapor, you know
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:23.080]   that death means to be with Christ, which is far better. And to enter into the glories and the
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:35.120]   joys and the possession of everlasting and eternal bliss. Oh my beloved friend, have you been working
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:40.880]   out this argument during these past days? Has this thing that has happened made you say, "What is my
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:47.240]   life? Am I right in my view? Am I banking on the right things? Have I got true riches? Have I got
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:57.960]   real gain?" And have you come to see that you haven't? But that because God is love and full
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:05.000]   of mercy and compassion and pity, that though we have sinned against him and forfeited every claim
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:13.760]   upon his love, he is ready to receive us. To pardon us in Christ, to make us his children,
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:20.600]   to give us this new nature, to shower his blessings upon us and in the end receive us
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:28.800]   unto himself. Have you worked out the argument, I ask? Have you considered these things? Oh stop
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:39.200]   boasting and rejoicing in your boastings. It'll all come to nothing. There is only one thing that
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:52.640]   matters for every one of us, and that is to know God, the Lord who controls everything. I've told
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:46:00.120]   you how he can be known. Thank God it's open to you now. If you have never known him, draw nigh
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:07.160]   unto God. Come unto him as you are, confessing your sin and failure. Cast yourself upon the love
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:15.040]   and mercy of God in Christ. Draw nigh unto God, and he will draw nigh unto you. I'm glad I can
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.600]   tell you that. You may not be here a week tonight, I may not be here. What is your life? What do you
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:29.440]   know about tomorrow? Well, when do you settle all this? Settle it now. Settle it now. You
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:36.320]   needn't wait a second to become a Christian. It isn't what you and I do, it's what Christ has
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.920]   done for us. This is something to be believed and to be received. It can be done here and now.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:52.480]   Clench it now. You may not get home tonight, do it now. Recognizing the character of life in this
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:47:06.120]   world, that it's but as a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanishes away. Settle
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:22.880]   your eternal destiny now. Draw nigh unto God, and God will draw nigh unto you. What shall it
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:30.360]   profit a man though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul? What shall a man give
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:45.520]   in exchange for his soul? Draw nigh unto him, and you will gain heaven, a knowledge of God,
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:54.920]   that will be with you and sustain you throughout the remainder of this changing, uncertain life,
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:06.340]   that will carry you through death, and that you will enjoy through all eternity. Amen.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:13.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
