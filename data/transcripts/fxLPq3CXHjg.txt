[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   And so even if you're going off the beaten path, sign language, you know, like everyone kind of
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.080]   knows the universal, like, "Cluck cluck" for chicken, right? And so, "Choo choo" for train.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.080]   You know, people want to help you. So you just got to give them that opportunity to just be like,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.960]   "This is what I need." You know, like, most communication is nonverbal anyway.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.240]   So based on, like, your facial expression or, like, how you're miming things or body language,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:42.480]   that can really help people figure out what you need. So never be afraid. And, you know,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.920]   there's always Google Translate now. So, like, worst case scenario, you open your phone and you
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:57.440]   type in and it kind of gives, like, an okay translation, but probably enough to get your
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.640]   point across to people. Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.360]   upgrading your life, money, and travel. If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins. And today, I'm
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.040]   talking with Matt Kepnes, better known as Nomadic Matt. In the early 2000s, he accidentally became
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.240]   one of the OG travel bloggers after saving money, quitting his job, and backpacking around the world.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.400]   For almost two decades, he's been traveling, writing about it, and sharing how Traveler is
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.720]   easier, cheaper, and more life-enriching than more people realize. He wrote the New York Times
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.840]   bestselling How to Travel the World on $50 a day. And later, after more than a decade of travels,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.240]   he wrote a memoir called 10 Years a Nomad. We're going to talk about why travel doesn't have to
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.440]   cost as much as you think, how travel changes after doing it for as long as Matt has, what to
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   do if you get burnt out on travel. We'll get some of Matt's favorite tactics for travels and discuss
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.040]   whether $50 a day is really enough. We'll also talk about why travel insurance is one of the most
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.240]   important elements of a good trip, which Matt knows firsthand from a crazy experience he'll
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.200]   share about getting stabbed abroad and a lot more than that. So let's get started right after this.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.400]   Matt, welcome to the show.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.880]   Thanks for having me. As always, it's fun to be here.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.200]   Well, I have a lot of questions. I'll special shout out All The Hacks member,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.920]   Alyssa, who sent in a ton of topics to discuss. But I want to just start off
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.160]   asking what you think the biggest misconception people have about travel is.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.120]   I mean, I think the obvious answer, at least to me, is that people think it's expensive.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.960]   I think less so now because so much is on social media and there's so many blogs and
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:48.400]   it's talked about. But I still think the vast majority of people will say, well, they don't
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.480]   really have time to travel. But if you did, there's always time. But then they're like,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.440]   "Oh, I just can't afford it." Because people think, "Oh, plane tickets are expensive. Hotels
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.520]   are being beat." They see all these commercials and this glamorized version of travel on social
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.160]   media. And they just think, "Well, that's pricing. Travel is a luxury item. It's not
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.400]   a must-have thing. It's something you do to relax, to take a break."
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.960]   And so there's this perception that this is expensive, when it doesn't have to be because
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.200]   you always can go over to wherever you're going and just do the local things and the local things
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:46.240]   cost a non-touristy price. And so I think if you ask people, "Well, how much do you spend in your
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:56.000]   own life?" People have these very way off estimates. They usually have a low... They're
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   on the lower end. But if you get people to record all their expenses, even like, "Oh, I bought a
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.680]   water bottle. That's a couple bucks." But you don't think about it. People actually spend a lot
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.320]   more than they think they do. And then when you balance that versus the price of travel, it's
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.920]   oftentimes cheaper. I live in the Bay Area. So anywhere in the world I would go has to be
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.160]   probably cheaper except maybe Tokyo or a few cities. So life other places is cheaper.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.080]   And I experienced this actually... It was probably almost 15 years ago. We traveled for 8 months,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.880]   and we rented our place out at home. And we broke even or even came out slightly ahead
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.600]   because it turns out we were spending more to live in the Bay Area than we were spending to travel.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.520]   But I want to get into some of those costs, some of the ways you save money,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.680]   some of the tactics you have. But I want to get started and just ask how travel has changed for
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.160]   you. I know you have been in this industry for longer than many. And by industry, I mean writing
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.360]   and sharing your travels online. You wrote a memoir about what you've learned after being a
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.120]   nomad for a decade. How have things evolved for you personally and in the industry?
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.920]   I started this when I was 25. I started traveling the world. So I'm 42 this year.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:30.320]   And so obviously, my days of cheap meals and 12-bed hostel dorms is long gone. I
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.600]   like nice food. Since I work when I travel, having a place to work is really important.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:47.520]   A lot of good sleep is important. So I tend to get my own room, hotels. I take a lot more paid
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.200]   walking tours or food tours. And so for me, the biggest thing is that my accommodation is a lot
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.160]   nicer. I take more paid activities. Whereas when I was 25, it was all about the free stuff, the
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   hostel dorms, cooking your own meals. I still consider myself a backpacker budget traveler.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:22.240]   I take public transportation. I love street food. I still do parks and local things and
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.440]   go to the markets and all that jazz. I'm not a resort guy. I don't really do luxury. I mean,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.160]   it's nice, but it feels very isolating to me. So that's the biggest thing that for me has changed.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.400]   It's probably been nicer days. And then how has travel changed? I think travel has become a lot
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.120]   more accessible than when I started traveling. Both the ability to do it and the ability to
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.400]   find information. When I started traveling, the internet was just sort of taking off as a means of
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.520]   finding information in the sense that you had forums and blogs and all these places you can
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.280]   go to ask questions about where do I find this hostel? How do I do this thing? And so I was still
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:18.480]   primarily using guidebooks as well as just asking around. But between social media and the advent of
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:26.240]   so many blogs, there's nothing you can't learn with a quick Google search. There's no hidden
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:35.200]   restaurant, this hidden town. There are places that are more well-known than anywhere else,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.160]   but there's no place that's unknown in the age of the internet. Somebody has been there and they
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.600]   posted an Instagram from there. No matter what little town it is, no matter where it is.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.000]   And so that is really great because it demystifies a lot of the travel experience.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.360]   It allows people to become more comfortable with going. It's not so much of like you're
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.920]   going into the unknown. It's like, "Oh, okay. I've heard of this place. I've heard of this thing.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.360]   So maybe I'll go there." Even if you're so scared because you're going to a place you've never been,
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:19.680]   it's no longer like this fog out there. The advent of all these budget airlines and everything has
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.560]   made it just a lot cheaper for people to travel. Yeah. Sometimes one of the ways that I get
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   inspiration is I'll just search on YouTube and it's, "Okay. Well, what's this place like?"
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.280]   It's like, "Here's a video of a person walking down the street." And you can get a really
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.840]   visceral feeling for what it's like to be there. And I remember
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.400]   when we first went to South and East Africa, I had this one BRAT travel guide that was from
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.200]   1998 because it was the only one that was... We were traveling for long enough that I couldn't
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.240]   bring a book for each country. So I was like, "This was the one." You don't get a lot of
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.440]   feeling about what you're about to embark on there. It was more of a directory.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:02.240]   Yeah. Guidebooks, even in the best of times, are usually a year and a half behind what's going on.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.520]   Yep.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.480]   I never have used guidebooks as a price guide. Just more of a rough guide.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.720]   Yes. Yeah, yeah. I think they're great about, "Here's the part of town to look for.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:20.000]   Here are some ideas of how transportation works." But I'm curious, you said now that you've gotten
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.840]   older, have done this a while, your digs have gone up. You wrote the book. People have referenced it
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:32.240]   in many ways about being the guide for backpacking about traveling the world on $50 a day. Do you
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:38.560]   think that still holds both in today's world, inflation, pandemic, and as people age and want
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.960]   to experience travel, not in a hostel with 12 beds? Yes and no. That book is never about the
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:51.600]   number. A lot of people would get caught up on that like, "Oh, $50. Good luck doing your way
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:59.840]   on $50." I mean, you're traveling the world on $50 a day. So it's a daily average. Some places,
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.480]   totally. Especially post-COVID, strong dollar. India is still very cheap.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:14.000]   Parts of Central America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, still very cheap.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.800]   But your average place for a hostel in Western Europe is probably 30 euros an hour a night.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:32.080]   So it's very rare to see dorm beds, 10 euros, 15 euros. They're still out there, but they're
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.320]   harder to find. And they're less common. And the beds are probably going to be like 20 beds.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   So if I, and I am going to redo this book, probably for a post-COVID, post-inflation world,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:54.240]   I'd probably up it to like a $65, $70 a day average. If you're doing the quintessential
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.760]   round the world trip, going to Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand,
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.880]   South and Central America. And if you're coming from the US, that's going to be
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:17.360]   even better because the US dollar is so strong right now. Will that stay? Who knows?
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:26.320]   When I planned my original trip around the world, I remember it was one US dollar got you $1.30
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.000]   Australian. So that's what my budget was based off of. And by the time I got there is one-to-one.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.040]   So I lost 30% of my budget because of that. So I had to readjust everything.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:51.040]   So it's less about the number and more about the style, the tips, the tricks. If you're just
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   looking for ways to travel cheap, forget about the number. Just use the strategies in the book.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.280]   Okay. So let's talk about some of those strategies. Because I liked how
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.560]   you actually broke it down. It wasn't just, "There are a bunch of strategies.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.760]   Go have a great trip." It's, "Here's what you specifically need to know."
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.840]   So how would you walk someone through the high level of planning
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.360]   a trip like this with a goal to do it on a budget? What are the best? What are the
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.600]   key strategies that people need to follow? I think the biggest thing for people is one,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.640]   travel slow. The more you can spread out your costs, the better it will be.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.680]   If you're moving around a lot, you're going to have high transportation costs. And that really
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   can eat into a lot of people's budgets. But the big thing is just really being flexible.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:44.000]   Because if you can wait for that deal to come, then you're not tied into, "I have to get this
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.160]   flight on this day to this destination." And so one of the benefits of long-term travel
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.600]   is that you're in no rush to do anything. You can wait for that flight deal, that hotel deal,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.440]   or you can find a flight deal or a hotel deal and be like, "That's where we're going next
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:06.320]   because that's where it's cheapest." And so big picture, always be flexible.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:14.400]   Second big picture thing is to travel like you live. You in your daily life cook food,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.080]   you don't eat expensive food all the time, restaurants. You look for free activities,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.600]   you take public transportation, you go for walks. Do the same when you're traveling.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.960]   If you really want to get a taste of local life, go to the local farmer's market,
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:38.480]   go take the train or the bus, go for a walk, sit in a park. Travel doesn't always have to be about
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.920]   doing things. It can be more about just existing in the place and soaking up the vibe.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:50.720]   And so if you travel like you live, you're going to end up doing all the things that locals do.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.240]   Because what people do in Berlin isn't different than what people do in the Bay Area or Austin.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.000]   Everyone gets up and goes to work and takes the train and goes grocery shopping and lives their
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   day-to-day life and then walks and maybe sits by the river. They do something. Sit in the park.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.960]   So I guess let's pause for a second and go back to a more macro question, which is
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:21.280]   when it comes to travel, why do you love travel? What is it about travel that
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.920]   makes it something that you've now, I guess, dedicated your entire professional career to
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.480]   and something you've spent decades of your life doing?
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:36.800]   I don't like to be bored. I guess that's one reason. When you travel, you're always doing
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:45.600]   something. I like mastering my own time. I mean, this is an accidental career. The goal was never
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:53.360]   to start a company. It was just to keep traveling for as long as possible so that I could have my
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.960]   own time, have my own schedule, do everything I wanted to do, just get out there and go explore
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:09.040]   and see the world. The world is a book, right? But the world is also a puzzle. And every place
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:15.920]   you go to adds one more piece to solve it. It's an unsolvable puzzle. You'll never finish it
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:23.520]   in your lifetime, but you just keep adding more to it. I just find people interesting.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.920]   I'm also deeply interested in history and politics. So going over to places and learning
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.160]   about why they do things is just fascinating to me. It sounds like a lot of those things aren't
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.360]   always the paid tour, the Michelin star meal. So finding the joy of travel that
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.760]   isn't what you saw on Instagram, I think, can often make for the experience.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.440]   So I'm curious, when you're trying to find those experiences, when you're trying to meet people,
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:55.360]   what do you do to connect with people? I think in today's world,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.400]   people are maybe a little more closed off than they were 20 years ago because they have their
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.960]   phone to distract them at a bar. It seems harder to meet people. Have you found ways to keep that
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.400]   kind of vibe going, especially now that you're not in the hostel? You might be in your own
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.200]   private room. Well, one of the reasons I still love hostels is even though I'm in my own private
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.560]   world, I'm a hostel. You still get the vibe, right? So you can still go to the common area.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   But I think the opposite is actually true. I think the internet has made it easier to meet people.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:35.360]   True, people have moved to their phone, especially in the hostel, in a way that wasn't true in 2006
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:42.800]   when I started traveling. But there are so many apps and ways to meet people through
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:52.960]   Couchsurfing, social media, Instagram, Facebook groups, Bumble BFF, Meetup.com,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.040]   walking tours, bar crawls. There's lots of ways to meet people. And the internet has actually
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.960]   made it easier to meet people if you're open to it. And I think people are a lot more open
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:13.360]   to just meeting a stranger online. It's not weird to like, "Oh, there's this cool meetup
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.400]   happening. I'm just going to walk over to it because I'm new here."
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.000]   Is there any kind of mental checklist or things you do before you're going to a new place
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.640]   to try to connect with people, figure out what to do? What resources do you use to crowdsource
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.760]   ideas of things that you might spend your time on? I know you do say, "Leave a lot of your time
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.800]   open for serendipity." So maybe the answer is none. But I'm curious what kind of research you
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.040]   do in advance. Very little. Maybe read a couple of blog posts, bookmark a few restaurants.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:52.720]   I try to just go there and see where the day takes me. Instagram, my Twitter feed.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:18:03.520]   But usually if I'm in the mood to meet people, in the sense that I want to actively make sure
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:11.840]   there's people around me, I'll either stay at a hostel or I'll look at an expat Facebook group
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.760]   or meetup.com or something and see what's going on while I'm there.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:27.040]   Since I travel a lot for work, my travels are about getting the price of food because we have
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:34.000]   to write a guide to it. It really depends on, "Am I there for research purposes or am I there for fun?"
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.680]   So if I'm there at a destination because we're going to write about it,
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.840]   I have a mission. I stick to it.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.480]   Yeah. If I chat up locals and they're like, "Come to this thing." I'm like, "Okay, sure."
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:58.560]   But my mind isn't like, "I'm gonna go join this group to see if there's a cool event going on."
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.320]   But if I'm there for fun, I most likely will do that.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.400]   Any memorable experiences that have come from random
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.160]   joining things that you just found on the internet?
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.720]   Just found on the internet? I joined a couple of couchsurfing groups when I
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:21.600]   lived in Paris a few years back. And those people became my friends for the entire time I lived
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:31.680]   there. Back in the day, during the MySpace era, I met a bunch of people in a Thailand travel group.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.240]   We ended up traveling around Southeast Asia for like 3 months together.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:42.560]   Yeah. Our travels were at a similar time in life. And it was the Lonely Planet Forums,
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.480]   where we would just post, "Hey, we're in South Africa. We ended up meeting these 2 guys from
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:54.320]   Sweden. And we ended up renting a car, buying a tent, and all this stuff together. And we basically
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.600]   camped in a tent with them driving around Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa for 3 weeks."
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:06.480]   So I think that's still possible. It just sounds like you got to find a few different places to
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:12.880]   find people. We do events here in Austin. And somebody came to one. "So how long have you been
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.560]   reading the blog?" Because I just threw that comment. So I was there and it's part of our
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:24.800]   blog thing. And she was like, "I just found this event on Eventbrite. I don't know what this is."
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.320]   And I was like, "That's really cool." She's like, "I'm just passing it through." I was like,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.520]   "Super. Well, welcome." I remember after 6 or so months,
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.320]   I was ready for something different. And we were doing some slow travel. I'm curious,
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.040]   you did it for a decade. What did you do to avoid getting burnt out about travel?
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.480]   It's impossible to get burnt out. No, I'm sorry. It's impossible not to get burnt out.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.000]   You will get burned out. At some point, you will get tired, you will get burnt out.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.920]   If you're just doing long-term travel, it becomes your day-to-day life. And eventually,
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.600]   you need a break from that. And so in your day-to-day life, you take a break, you go on
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:13.360]   vacation. And if travel life, you can just sit in one place and recharge your battery.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.920]   Travel is a battery. It's not some unlimited wellspring of energy. You need to rest at some
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:27.760]   point. Because everywhere you go, you have to relearn how to live, the language, how to get
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:37.200]   around, where to eat, where to stay, to walk around, local customs, the streets. You're
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:45.360]   relearning life every day. And that's mentally very taxing. There's a reason why when you drive
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:53.040]   to work all the time, you can tune out. It becomes like a routine. Your mind just goes on autopilot.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.640]   When you're traveling, there is no autopilot because you're relearning everything.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:08.480]   And so eventually, you just burn out. You need a break. And so slow travel can really help that
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:17.040]   because you're not really rushing yourself a lot. So you're adjusting to new places at a slower pace.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.280]   But even the slowest of travelers, eventually, they're just like, "I just want to sit."
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:31.040]   Even short trips, I found, can be a lot. And so sometimes, it feels so counterintuitive to
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   spend an afternoon on a one-week trip, like watching a movie in your hotel room.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.040]   But the amount of energy you can recharge by just hanging out and relaxing, I think,
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.560]   is really valuable. And so I think people very often think, "Oh, I'm in this country. I can't
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.440]   afford to not be doing something every second of every day." But sometimes, you start to lose
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.400]   the appreciation for it if it feels like it's painful and it's work. So don't be afraid,
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.720]   I think, to take a break, even on a week-long trip for an afternoon.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.760]   Yeah. And if your goal is to go to Italy for a week to soak in Italian culture,
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.960]   spending an afternoon doing nothing is very much a part of Italian culture.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:22.080]   Go sit at the piazza and just enjoy a cafe and just sit around and chat.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.600]   People watch. You get a real sense of Italy that way.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.560]   Yeah, you mentioned customs and all the learning of a new place.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   I've had a few questions from listeners that ask about going to places that are very unfamiliar,
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.320]   whether it's the customs or the language. I'm curious what advice you have to someone.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.960]   Maybe they're going somewhere in the Middle East or in Asia, where the customs and the
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.480]   language are all totally foreign to them. What would you tell them to do either in advance or
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.320]   just to help them understand how it might not be as difficult as they might think?
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:07.360]   Read a book. You can't really know a place until you've read something about it. So I always find
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:14.240]   reading up about where you're visiting. A history book, if you can, or even just a
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:20.640]   current events book, something that just gives you insight into the local culture
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.520]   can be super helpful. Additionally, there's so many blogs out there in the world these days
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:34.560]   that you can read on any subject you want. And from local writers too.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.520]   People that live in destinations are now local bloggers.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:45.680]   So that can really help you get a sense of place and understanding.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:51.120]   Also, a great way to get food recommendations too. If you find a local food blogger on Instagram,
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.320]   their audience is other locals, not tourists. So you're going to get all the inside info.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.800]   Yeah, if you have a VPN, and you can connect to an IP in the country, or maybe you can change your
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.880]   Google search to that country, you might get a different set of results than if you're searching
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.640]   from a US IP or on Google US search. So I've sometimes found a better set of results when
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.200]   I'm searching for stuff online, if I can anchor myself. Maybe there's a local search engine even.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.480]   But if you could try to anchor yourself to searching within the country, you get maybe
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.560]   more relevant topics than the kind of travel guide from the foreigners overseas.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:35.280]   But I know one thing that I've heard you talk about maybe more articulately than I can is about
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.440]   communication. And I think so many people might assume that you need to speak a language to go
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.080]   lots of places, especially if you want to go off the beaten path. And so first, I'm going to ask,
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.680]   how many languages do you actually speak, given that I think you've probably been to,
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.360]   if not 100, close to 100 countries, I'm guessing?
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:26:02.800]   I speak pretty good Spanish, decent Thai, and I can understand and read French, though my
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.120]   ability to give a reply is very slow.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:13.200]   But that hasn't held you back from going to plenty of countries that don't speak those languages?
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:19.440]   You know, I mean, English is pretty widely spoken. At least basic English.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:26.080]   And so even if you're going off the beaten path, sign language, you know, like,
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.320]   everyone kind of knows the universal like, "Cluck cluck" for chicken, right? And so,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:39.360]   "Choo choo" for train. You know, people want to help you. So you just got to give them that
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.920]   opportunity to just be like, "This is what I need." You know, like, most communication is nonverbal
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:55.600]   anyway. So based on like, your facial expression, or like, how you're miming things or body language,
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:03.840]   that can really help people figure out what you need. So never be afraid. And you know,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.120]   there's always Google Translate now. So like, worst case scenario, you open your phone and
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:16.320]   you type in and it kind of gives like an okay translation, but probably enough to get
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.920]   your point across to people.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.200]   Does it ever feel like cheating to you a little bit? Having been to the type of travel where you
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.360]   had to rely on so much intuition or kind of hard work to communicate with people that didn't speak
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.680]   the language that now it's like, "Well, I guess I could just pull out my phone and type something
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.800]   and it could be understood by someone that has no common language threads."
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.360]   I don't like it just because I don't like pulling out my phone. In some parts of the world,
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:53.120]   that's not always the wisest thing to do. So I'd rather just do it the old-fashioned way.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:59.600]   But I'm an old funny daddy. So, you know. I mean, if there was like an earpiece that did it,
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   I would probably get that earpiece. Like, you know, like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:09.840]   where they put that slug in his ear and he can understand everything. That's what I would
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:15.680]   probably do. I don't like pulling out my phone a lot because then you're always on your phone.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.160]   It's like back and forth. It slows down conversation.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.600]   You mentioned earlier that now you like to stay in places by yourself, but you also like to go on a
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:30.480]   lot more tours that cost money. How do you find them? How do you make sure you don't get caught
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:38.080]   up in terrible tours designed for tourists that are maybe not as good as a much better one that
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.560]   you... Are there review sites? How do you think about that?
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:48.000]   I do mostly day walking tours, or a food tour or something like that. Very rarely do multi-day
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.360]   trips. But Best Walking Tour in X is really a pretty good search term. I'll read a couple of
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:02.640]   blog posts. And if the same company appears in a couple, and their tours look good and reasonably
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:11.600]   priced, I'll probably pick them. You can see star ratings. So if 17,000 people are TripAdvisor,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:18.800]   this is four stars. And then three writers on blogs are like, "I took this tour and it was
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.960]   really good. And I wasn't paid to say that." Okay, maybe it's pretty good.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.880]   It's always good to look for my unbiased opinion of... I find that to be a helpful
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.600]   search term for almost any product. You're like, "Unbiased opinion. XYZ mattress."
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.800]   So is there any place you've been where you've actually found that
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:45.120]   just sign language and English weren't enough? And to be clear, when we say sign language,
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:50.960]   we're not talking ASL, professional sign communication. We're talking about more
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.240]   hand miming and gestures. But are there places you've found that it's actually
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.440]   been very difficult to get around and communicate? No, not really.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:06.320]   Maybe I haven't been to enough places that are so off the beaten path. But I've always found that
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:14.320]   miming and sign language gets you far enough. I want to go back to some of the tactics,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.840]   especially around what you travel with. I know you're a fan of a backpack. But
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.160]   nowadays, what are the things that you take on every trip that you think...
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.080]   Not the obvious things, right? I'm sure you bring a toothbrush. But
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.720]   what are the things that people might be packing that are different from how you pack?
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:41.040]   I mean, I honestly don't take much stuff with me. Because I started in a time where you didn't need
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:48.640]   a lot. And so if I ever need something, like an umbrella, I'll buy it. Or if I need medicine,
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:55.280]   I'll pick it up on the way. I definitely take a towel. The Checkers Guide to the Galaxy 101.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.480]   I always have a towel. But honestly, I don't take much stuff. I mean, I'm not a photographer.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:09.760]   So I just use my phone. But to me, less is more. Like, what do you need to take? A couple clothes,
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.840]   a couple of books, a phone charger, and your phone. I take my computer. I take a notebook,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:24.000]   a journal, backup credit cards. That's really it. I take a flashlight. I think a lot of people
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.640]   underestimate the power of having a flashlight, especially if you're camping a lot or just out
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.840]   in rural areas often. Just having that with you is really good.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:42.000]   But other than that, I don't take a lot of gear. I'm like anti-gear. I'm also anti-app.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.120]   If you're always like, "What apps do you use?" I'm like, "Google Maps." That's it.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.080]   And you mentioned backup credit cards. We could go probably for a while about
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.000]   travel hacking. But one area I haven't really talked about is how much do you think about
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.080]   banking and budgeting and that aspect of it for a long-term trip where you're going to
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:06.560]   need to access money and you need to pay bills? Do you do anything differently than you would
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:11.120]   if you were living stateside? So I'm in this unique position
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:17.440]   where I work in travel. So money comes in and it's all taxed right now for me.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:23.200]   So I would say that my recommendation for people is always to have two bank accounts. If you're
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:29.520]   an American, you should definitely have the Charles Schwab ATM card. There are no bank fees,
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.440]   no ATM fees. And if you get charged an ATM fee, they will reimburse your ATM fee.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:42.640]   So I always have money there. That's my primary card when I travel. And if you lose it,
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.400]   they'll basically FedEx it to you anywhere in the world within 48 hours.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:54.080]   But it's always good to have a backup just in case it's hacked or something happens where
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:02.000]   you can't get it in 48 hours. So I always carry two credit... I'll carry more than two credit
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.920]   cards just because I'm a travel hacker. But two ATM cards and at least two credit cards.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:15.920]   And you only ever go out with one. I only take my ATM card out very rarely. It's always home.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:23.280]   Just the cash out that you need. But that varies by destination. I mean, in Japan,
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.800]   you could walk around with $10 million in your pocket. No one's going to do anything.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:37.200]   So versus like, I wouldn't walk around Columbia with a bunch of money or plastic in my pants.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:44.000]   But at least definitely those two. And for the primary account
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.320]   that I have in terms of the Charles Schwab card, I only keep a few thousand dollars in there.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.800]   So if somebody were to kidnap me and say, "Take all the money out,"
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.240]   it's not going to drain everything, right? There's only a maximum amount they can take.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.480]   What about passport? Do you bring the passport with you when you're out and about or leave it
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.360]   back in the hotel or hostel? I always leave it in the hotel or hostel.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.840]   And has that ever caused a problem? I know I've heard varying opinions here,
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.880]   which is like, "You always want to have some form of ID if something happens,
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.160]   if you get in trouble." And then the other is like, "You definitely don't want to have
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.920]   your passport lost, dropped, stolen while you're out."
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:31.680]   I bring my driver's license with me everywhere I go as a form of ID. The passport stays inside.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:38.400]   The only time I will break that rule is if it's required for a spot check on the train.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:46.000]   Sometimes in Europe, if you're on the train, even if you're just going between cities,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:55.200]   they'll be like, "Passport." That's like a spot check. But just going out to the bar or a
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:01.280]   restaurant or walking around, no. And if I were to ever get stopped by the police, they're like,
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.240]   "Where's your passport?" I'd be like, "It's in my hotel. Come get it. Let's go get it."
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:21.120]   Really, they'll mostly fine you. I guess if you were in a country that required it and you got
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:28.080]   stopped and there was a lot of corruption, you may have to pay a bribe. Nobody wants that paperwork.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.240]   "Why did you arrest this guy? He didn't have his passport on him." It's a lot of paperwork for
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:39.440]   nothing. The universal rule is cops never want to do paperwork. Every country has paperwork.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:47.760]   At the worst, you'll get a warning. At the worst, you'll get a warning. At the worst,
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.960]   you'll pay a fine, like a bribe. A fine. With air quotes.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:36:00.000]   Yeah. Have you been in any of those situations where you've had to pay a fine/bribe?
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:06.480]   Nope. Never. Our only one was a border crossing from Syria into Lebanon.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:14.560]   And the taxi driver, funny enough, he was so embarrassed that his country would be the kind
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:19.760]   of place where you had to pay a fine that he paid the fine out of his own fare because he didn't want
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.440]   us to know about it. But later, we were in the car for a few hours. We asked about it. He was
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.120]   like, "Yeah, the way this works is if you get to the border and you have foreigners and you don't
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.080]   pay a tip, then they just hold you here for hours. And that causes delays for me and you,
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.840]   and our country's terrible at doing this stuff. But I'll do it."
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   So I've never had to do it myself. But I know the paperwork issue deeply because
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:49.040]   my wife was pulled over speeding in Bosnia. And they were sitting here like, "Oh,
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.400]   this is the fine." And she was like, "I don't know." We just waited it out. And eventually,
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.120]   they're like, "Yeah, you can go because we're not going to try to fill out this
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.840]   paperwork for your international driver's license and everything."
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.200]   Yeah. I always count on nobody wants to do paperwork.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.640]   Okay. One thing we haven't talked about that I know you have a pretty strong opinion on is
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:17.920]   travel insurance. What perspective do you have on travel insurance and its necessity in a day where
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.680]   so many credit cards have lots of forms of insurance baked into them?
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.040]   I still think it's very important just because you get better medical care,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:38.000]   like emergency care. It's really the only higher end premium credit cards with $600 a year top end
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.160]   ones where you get really robust travel insurance. But even then, these aren't travel insurance
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:51.040]   companies. They're credit cards tapping this on. So they're not really streamlined to process
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.760]   claims in a way that a company whose only purpose is travel insurance.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:03.520]   A lot of these credit cards don't really cover good medical evacuation. And so if you
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:13.040]   just want protection on trip interruption or cancellation or something gets stolen,
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:20.560]   yeah, the credit card you paid that trip on is probably good enough. But if you want actual
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.720]   medical insurance in case something goes wrong, you're going to want something to pay
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:33.760]   extra for. And travel insurance isn't that expensive. So you're not paying like $100 a month,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.960]   get plans for $50. Are there any providers you've used that
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.240]   or you do use or I guess what do you use when you travel?
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:47.680]   Yeah, I use a company called Safetyway. They're really good. World Nomads is also really good
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:56.880]   for people having more gear. Insure Nomads is really good, but pretty expensive. And then
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.640]   for seniors, I would definitely recommend Insure My Trip because not a lot of plans
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.280]   cover people over 70. Okay. Have you ever had to use travel insurance?
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:13.920]   Yeah. I used it in Colombia. I've used it in South Africa when my bag got stolen.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.880]   It's just in Thailand. So yeah, I used it quite a number of times. It's coming very handy. It's
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.920]   coming handy for friends. I had a friend break their back in the Amazon. They had to get airlifted
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.640]   out and then sent back to Canada. And travel insurance covers the whole thing.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.040]   Wow. Yeah. And I think it's so funny. We get caught up in thinking travel insurance
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:40.400]   is about "My flight got canceled." But it can be about a lot of other things. And
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.560]   I will say medical... I don't know what kind of medical situations you've ever been in
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.760]   overseas. They don't end up being that expensive unless they're very extreme. And I can assure you
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.480]   that an airlift from South America to Canada is not something you want to have to cover on your own.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:01.360]   That you do not. That you do not. So have you been in a situation where
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   something went wrong? I mean, you mentioned your bag got stolen, you've gotten mugged,
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.240]   something like that. And why didn't that stop you from travel? When I think so many people,
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.440]   that's their fear, that something bad would happen. And if it does happen,
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.320]   they might not want to travel again. I have to assume it's happened to you. And you've kept going.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:29.680]   Yeah. I got stabbed in Colombia. And my mother always sends me every State Department warning
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.760]   about Mexico. But it's like, "Hey, we live in the States. People get gunned down going to Walmart."
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.520]   There are mass shootings all the time in this country. Bad things happen. It's just part of
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:52.000]   life. It doesn't matter if you're home or in Mexico or in Thailand or in Paris or in Japan,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:01.920]   shit happens. And so you can live in fear and say, "I'm just going to never go anywhere." But then
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:09.440]   walk across the street to a movie theater and then make it out because of some psychopath.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:16.000]   Or you get hit by a car on your way to work. So it's like, "Are you really going to live in fear?"
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.680]   But what if? If so, then never leave your house.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:25.360]   If you're up for it, I'd love to hear the story in Colombia. And maybe from the perspective of...
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.600]   I think a lot of people don't really plan for that. So they don't know what they would do
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:36.560]   in that circumstance. And I imagine you're here now. So it all went well. What happened? And
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.640]   how did you know what to do? And where did you end up going? And how did the trip unfold after that?
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:49.280]   Yeah, I was in Bogota. And I had my phone out. Long story short, you shouldn't have
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:56.560]   fancy electronics out. I just forgot to put it back in before I left this cafe.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.960]   And so I tried to take it and he jerked backwards instead of just
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:09.040]   going forward. And so we started tussling. And then yeah, he had a small little knife.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.520]   I thought he was just punching me. If he had shown the knife, I would have been like, "Don't
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:20.320]   take the phone." But afterwards, I was like, "Oh, so sorry." And I was just covered in blood.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   I assume you went to the hospital and everything was fine?
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:33.120]   Yeah, the whole thing cost me like 50 bucks. Honestly, the flight home was like 1000 bucks.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:43.200]   And I have to reimburse me for that. But the 50 bucks, I was like, "It's not worth the paperwork."
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.520]   I mean, they could have done it for 50 bucks, but I did it for the flight.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.520]   Would you go back to Bogota after that?
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:57.760]   Oh, yeah. 100%. I love, love Bogota. I was really sad to have to go home.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:03.280]   Yeah. I've also been to Bogota. And I think, especially... I mean, it's just a great place.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:08.560]   I love the country of Colombia. I've been there a few times. Bogota is close enough
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.120]   and no time zone good enough that I think you could even do it in a long weekend
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:20.000]   and have a great trip. Not that... I don't want to not do slow travel. But I think for those who
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.200]   don't have the time to do it, it's still a place that you can go in a short period of time because
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.040]   of the proximity. It's such a phenomenal place. I was there for 6 weeks and I'm gonna stay another
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.480]   6 weeks. I want to just get some quick thoughts on travel hacking. I've obviously covered this
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.600]   topic a ton. You've thought about it a lot. Are there perspectives you have on it that you think
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:48.080]   are maybe a little bit contrarian to the average person who plays the points and miles game that
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:54.320]   would be helpful? Yeah. I think that people get too caught up in point value. For most people,
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.880]   just get a card, book your flight, that works, and don't spend time doing it.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   People overcomplicate the simple. For a person who's going on one to two trips a year,
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:15.200]   one credit card or two credit cards just to optimize spending bonuses, it's going to be more
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:24.320]   than enough. People are like, "Oh, well, this is worth 1 cent. So you want to move it here on 2
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:30.960]   days?" Yeah, you could really go deep. But for most people, they're taking one trip a year,
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.960]   2 trips a year. It doesn't really matter that much. Don't spend a lot of time.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:47.200]   What matters more? That it costs $100,000 points in $5 or 70,000 points in $500. I'd rather spend
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.560]   more points than more money. So when people are like, "Oh, I got this great deal. It's only
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:59.040]   60,000 points plus $400." It's like, "Well, yeah." For this business class flight, it's like, "Yeah,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:04.560]   but you're paying a lot in those fees." To me, that's not worth it. But some people are like,
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.680]   "No, I did the math out." And it's like that meme of all the numbers. It's like
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.520]   the guy from The Hangover. It's like they're calculating all this point value. It's like,
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:21.520]   "Aha! I've saved 62 cents." I'm like, "Yeah, but you spent 5 hours to figure it out."
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.240]   So what's your setup for travel hacking? Do you have a lot of cards, a couple cards?
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.880]   I mean, I have like 30 cards.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.720]   Okay. Okay. So...
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:36.000]   Crazy. But I also have this for work too. So it's like really different. And I travel
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.760]   constantly. But my biggest... On my personal stuff, I use Built, which is a card that lets you get
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:52.000]   points on your rent for free, and they have some good category bonuses that I use.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   And then I use the Chase Sapphire. For work, I either use an Amex Gold or
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:05.680]   a Chase. Any favorite tactics for redeeming?
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:12.000]   There's a great new website out called Point.me. And you can just connect all your stuff through
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.400]   an API and just search where you want to go and it'll tell you where to transfer your points to
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.160]   get the most value. That's a really good news website. They're still working on some of the
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.400]   kinks. One of the things I don't like is you can't do a calendar view. You have to
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:40.560]   search day by day by day. Very frustrating. But it's a new program. So they'll fix it eventually.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:46.000]   Yeah. When I talked to Heather, one of the... Or Tiffany, one of the founders,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.560]   she basically said, "Don't expect that much because there might be a premium tier
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.720]   that you pay more for if you want to search more dates."
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.840]   So it's not clear that the full calendar view is coming. But I do like Seatspy for that feature.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:08.560]   They give you a 365-day calendar view for a handful of airlines.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:15.920]   Before we wrap, I want to go down one path, which is just inspiring people with some of
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.560]   the kind of off the beaten path places you've enjoyed that people might not be considering.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.480]   I know I get lots of emails of people saying, "Oh, I have a trip coming up to Paris or London
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:30.320]   or Tokyo." But I think once you've ticked off some of the most common places,
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.400]   you're looking for inspiration, you've done more travel than probably anyone listening.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.000]   What are some places you think people need to put on their list to explore?
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.680]   Taiwan, Romania, Bulgaria,
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:52.320]   Mexico. Not a lot of people... I mean, offbeat Mexico. Get out of Tulum and Playa and all those
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:58.640]   places. Maybe if you can, spend like, I don't know, a minute on each of the top few and just
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.880]   kind of... I haven't been to most of these, but I've been to Taiwan and it was fantastic. But a
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:09.360]   few of the others, I haven't. So I'm dying to know what set them apart from the rest of the world.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:17.440]   Taiwan is just like very under-visited, great food, just like clean China.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:28.000]   South Korea also, just great nightlife and food. Bulgaria and Romania,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.680]   incredible history, ruins, smaller than medieval towns,
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:43.200]   national parks and mountains and you get the coast and it's just phenomenal and cheap and
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:51.040]   not a lot of people go there. Mexico is amazing. Everyone's super nice. It's just a vibrancy to
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.080]   life there, plus the food. So you can see there's a trend.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:49:00.960]   Where in Mexico? I think Mexico might be really easy for a lot of people in the States to
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:08.640]   start exploring and flights can be pretty cheap. Where would you recommend... Someone's been to
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:14.000]   Mexico City or Cabo or Cancun. What are the places that you think...
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:21.680]   San Miguel, Delende, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Yucatan State, not the Peninsula,
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:31.840]   Merida, Monterey, just got places that come to mind.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:43.840]   It's a huge country, but most travelers stick to a few places. I love Mexico City too, so
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.120]   can't go wrong there. Other places that come to mind,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:50:00.080]   visualize the world. Malaysia, I don't think gets enough attention. Sri Lanka,
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:06.960]   Nepal, also just great places, but not a lot of tourists.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:11.200]   Basically getting a really unfiltered view of places.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.840]   Yeah, I think that's something I'm looking for now as we evolve.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.400]   But one thing that's changed for me, and I'd love your perspective. We did a lot of travel
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.040]   solo, did a lot of travel with my wife, backpacking, and now we have kids.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:31.520]   I know you said you're now in your 40s. How do you think travel for people who are now
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:39.120]   have a more demanding career, aren't able to work entirely on the road, have kids, have families,
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:45.440]   how do you think that affects the style of travel you've spent years writing about and living?
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.800]   And what do you think that looks like for the years ahead for you?
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:58.240]   Well, I think budget travel is a state of mind more than a style. Like, "Oh,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:05.200]   we have to stay in hostels or whatever." So for me, as long as I'm still doing the local thing,
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:17.520]   to me, that's just budget travel. I don't think I will change that. I mean, I don't really like
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.240]   cruises. And then whenever I stay at resorts, I'm like, "Everything here is overpriced. I just want
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:29.840]   to go eat whatever the locals are eating." I don't want to eat at a resort. So I don't really see a
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:40.320]   lot of change happening in my life. I think even as a family, things change, of course.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.840]   But as long as you're doing that local thing, it's really just more about
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.800]   your mindset than it is like, "Oh, anything else."
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:57.680]   Yeah. I think one thing that I'm going to change is just... And you already highlighted this,
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:04.000]   but just having less things to do. It's easy to get three or four things done on your own in a day
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.040]   and still have lots of time for exploration. With a family, it just feels like one.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:14.800]   The goal is one thing to accomplish today. And let everything else come to chance. Or
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.360]   maybe let your kids drive. We just had a great conversation with Derek Sivers, who talked about
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:26.400]   how he traveled with his son. And it was just let him lead and explore through their eyes,
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.280]   which can be very different from exploring through your own.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:37.440]   So I think the big summary for me, reflecting on... This is really reminiscent because I
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:42.160]   did an eight-month trip where it was just like this. And my wife and I did a lot of this before
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:48.000]   kids. It's just recognizing that you're not going to... A lot of what you're going to experience,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.520]   like your example in Italy, is being in another place, understanding another culture, food,
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:53:00.400]   language. And that doesn't require seeing every museum in the town. It doesn't require ticking
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:06.160]   off every five-star restaurant. It can be a lot different. And it can be a lot more rewarding to
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:12.080]   do that. And even more so if you get outside of the cities. Sometimes just where you stay.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:19.200]   Maybe don't stay in the most central part of town to force yourself to be around locals.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   I agree. I think as you age, you slow down. Especially if you have kids, you slow down.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:34.320]   I don't have kids, but I've had a lot of other parents who travel with kids say the same thing.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.520]   They let their kids just go and their kids will just discover things. And they then discover
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:47.360]   things. One thing I'm going to wrap with, is there a place in the world that if someone were going,
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:52.160]   you have a few recommendations? Maybe it's because you lived there for a while.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.080]   Maybe it's because it's home. I mean, if you can go to Paris and go to
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:05.440]   La Dites Vines, that's a great restaurant. L-E-D-I-T-V-I-N.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.880]   How would you spend a day in Paris if you only had one?
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:16.000]   Let's wander and wander and wander. Get some wine, sit on the sand, sit in a park,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   go to a cafe, and just eat.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.160]   If people want to stay on top of everything you're writing, traveling,
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.760]   posting, where should they head?
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.680]   You can find me everywhere at nomadicmap.com and nomadicmap on social media.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.840]   It's just traveling nomadic map. I'm branded the same thing throughout everything.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.080]   Awesome. Thanks for being here.
