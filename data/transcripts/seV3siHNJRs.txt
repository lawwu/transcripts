[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   - What do you think it is about failure
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.680]   or missing the mark in some way that catalyzes change?
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.880]   I mean, I always say that, you know,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.660]   your brain has no reason to change
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.900]   if you're just in trying to learn something
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.680]   and you're in flow, you're getting, you know,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.720]   most people associate being quote unquote in flow
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.900]   with getting everything correct, doing everything correctly.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.460]   I don't think that was the original definition
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.640]   that Sheikh Zumahai intended,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.920]   but the neuroscience of brain plasticity tells us
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.220]   that it's only under conditions
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.240]   in which there's some mismatch
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.320]   between what you're trying to do,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.080]   like even, you know, like this has been studied
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.480]   in terms of reaching for an object
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.880]   and there's a mirror displacement
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.740]   or a prism displacement or something,
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.000]   you eventually can learn to error correct
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.820]   because the cup is actually over there
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.360]   as opposed to where you see it,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.520]   but it is the deployment of these chemicals inside of us,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.280]   adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.280]   in particular, those three, their cousins,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.920]   the catecholamines that tells the,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.800]   at a neurochemical level, tells the synapses,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.080]   wait, something needs to change.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.240]   I mean, the brain doesn't have any reason to change
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.960]   unless there's frustration, agitation,
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.720]   or at least some neurochemical change
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.840]   associated with those things
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.760]   that we call frustration and agitation.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.200]   So do you think these big,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.760]   what feel like cataclysmic fails
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.560]   set like a sort of window of plasticity
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.520]   in which we can change?
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.240]   I often didn't think that,
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.120]   that it's only through like the devastation
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.320]   of a huge loss that the brain is now set up
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.720]   for a bunch of new learning.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.020]   Certainly we wouldn't want to design the system that way,
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.520]   but as I always joke, you know,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.640]   I wasn't consulted at the design phase
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.920]   and you weren't either.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.400]   We just had to work with what's there.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.320]   Like big failure.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320]   Why do you think that sets a wave front of change?
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.640]   - I think the way that I,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.060]   like if I think about the most painful losses of my life,
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.680]   the most devastating injuries of my life,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.840]   I think about dying, drowning.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.360]   I drowned in the bottom of,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.920]   doing hypoxic breathwork in a pool.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.840]   So on the bottom of the pool four and a half minutes after,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   it led to the arguably the best decision of my life
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.200]   to move into the jungle.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   I think about the losing the last round
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   of the under 18 World Chess Championship on the first board.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.760]   That's a very interesting story
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.700]   I could describe a little bit.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.840]   Or I think about like my first national championship I lost
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.640]   when I was seven, eight,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.440]   first board, last round,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.900]   just unobstructed learning until then.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.560]   And then I lost the last round on the,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.460]   for the title, fell into an opening trap.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.080]   Like that's the loss that was the greatest thing
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.200]   that ever happened to me.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   - You were how old?
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.400]   - I think I'd just turned eight or I was late seven.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.480]   And like that was, it was,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.040]   'cause if I had won that game,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.520]   I easily could have associated winning with just no pain,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.880]   no heart, just cruising up to the end.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.420]   That was the moment that like I got my ass kicked.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.200]   I had to go back, deal with these demons,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.560]   come back, train for the next year,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.480]   and then I won the next year.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.860]   And then it was off to the races.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.040]   My life might look very different if I'd won that game.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.960]   And actually the kid who beat me in that game,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.360]   David Arnett, became, two years later,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.600]   we became best friends.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.800]   For all of our childhood,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.900]   we were on the same chess team and best friends.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.960]   And I think he gave me the greatest gift
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   of my competitive life by kicking my ass that game.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.360]   The most devastating loss of my chess life
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.320]   was, so I was 17 years old.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.840]   I was competing in the World Under 18 Chess Championship
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.880]   in Szeged, Hungary.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.560]   Every, so every year there's an Under 12, 14, 16, 18,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.120]   and 21 World Championship.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.320]   And I was always representing the US
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.480]   in those tournaments around the world.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   And I traveled to India or Brazil or Hungary or Germany
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.240]   or somewhere and compete in the World Championship.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.240]   And Under 18 Worlds, I played the tournament.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.400]   I just was playing very inspired chess.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.360]   I had just picked up On the Road
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.760]   three weeks before Jack Kerouac.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.320]   I had become, I was just on fire with Kerouac's vision.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   And I was just so appreciating life
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.720]   with a freshness and intensity than I'd ever had,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.600]   more than I'd ever had.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.640]   I was totally on fire, in chess, in life,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.680]   in love, in everything.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   And I was paired against Peter Svidler, who was the Russian.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.240]   We were on the first board last round.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.400]   We were playing for the World Championship.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.880]   Every country sends their national champion,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.800]   so it's a long tournament to get there.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.320]   Early in the game, I think it was move 12,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.360]   he offered me a draw.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.220]   So if I'd accepted the draw offer,
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.400]   it would have gone to tie breaks.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.920]   I didn't know exactly what was happening,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.200]   but I thought that he was slightly favored in tie breaks.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.520]   I wasn't sure, but basically the World Championship
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.760]   would be determined, or the gold medal would be determined
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.400]   by how our opponents in previous rounds did
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.840]   in the last round.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.920]   But I hadn't calculated it out before,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.720]   but I had a feeling it was like,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.180]   maybe it was like 40-60 or 30-70 against me.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.120]   But it was my style.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.240]   I never accepted a draw first.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.080]   That wasn't my style.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.200]   I always wanted to fight.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.780]   So I declined, pushed for a win.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.800]   Now, the beauty of his decision was also
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.840]   he offered me a draw in the critical position
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.160]   where I had to make a very specific decision,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.040]   which is a trick that chess players play on one another,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.880]   which is that if you're,
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   we should talk about tension at one point.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.680]   It's a really beautiful theme to explore
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.940]   in different sports.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.520]   So one thing that happens in chess games
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.560]   is that you have this building tension between minds,
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.440]   and often the tension on the chess board
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.880]   and the tension on the minds are mounting together.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.100]   And the urge, the need to release psychological tension
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.600]   often leads to the decision to release chess tension
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.720]   in the chess pieces.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.640]   And when you release chess tension,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.280]   usually the person who releases the tension
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.420]   will be on the wrong side of tactics.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.960]   So a lot of chess game is about putting mental pressure
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.640]   on the opponent to force them to break the tension
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.920]   on the chess board.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.280]   So in that game, he offered me a draw.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.520]   So you think about it, we're 17 years old.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.140]   We're 10 days into a world championship battle.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.980]   We, even no matter how much we love the battle,
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.060]   some piece of ourselves wants a way out.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.940]   Like we want to release the tension, right?
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.480]   It's just elemental to who we are
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.240]   when we're living with that much pressure.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.280]   So all I have to do then is like accept the draw,
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.840]   shake hands, and the tournament's over,
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.980]   and then it's out of our hands what happens.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.820]   So in that moment,
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.540]   I have to also make a critical chess position.
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.700]   So the urge to release the tension
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.900]   is subtly entering into my chess decision.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.340]   And in that move, I declined the draw,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.540]   and I made a slightly overaggressive move,
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.420]   which turned, and he ended up playing a beautiful game,
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.420]   big attack, beating me.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.260]   I lose the world championship.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.120]   Just this close to like your dream.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.520]   You're shattered, right?
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.760]   I then went and hitchhiked across Eastern Europe
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.360]   to meet my girlfriend at the time
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.720]   in a little town in Slovenia,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.360]   and then we broke up and all that.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.920]   Then I ended up meeting again in a street corner in Brazil,
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.520]   the World Under 21 Championship three weeks later.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.880]   Lots of drama, you know, being a 17-year-old kid.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   I didn't study that chess loss for two and a half months.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.320]   It was so painful to me.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.100]   I always studied games immediately afterwards,
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.420]   and you might study a chess game
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.580]   for anywhere between three and 15 hours,
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.780]   studying one chess game.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.420]   And that, say, 10 hours is focused
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.100]   on the two or three critical positions of the game.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.780]   And this was before chess computers were rampant,
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.620]   and you had chess engines
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.740]   that could always just tell you the answer to the move.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.460]   That's also something we should talk about later,
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.380]   how chess engines and AI chess engines
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.240]   change the nature of who chess players are
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.700]   because you can have the answer right away
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.500]   versus having to sit in cognitive
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.260]   and emotional dissonance for sometimes weeks
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.620]   or months at a time without knowing the answer.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.020]   But we'll come back to that maybe.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.660]   So I didn't study that loss for two and a half months
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.940]   'cause it was so painful to me.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.540]   Then I was, my family spent a lot of time at sea,
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.300]   which was an interesting part of my life and my chess life,
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.220]   living on a little boat, catching our own food,
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.540]   doing our own engine work.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.540]   And I was at sea after competing
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.640]   in both of those world championships and some other things.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.120]   And I sat down to study that game.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.160]   And I spent a dozen plus hours
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.120]   studying that one critical position of the game.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.140]   And then I realized what the,
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.460]   like the move I should have made
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.080]   was outside of my conceptual scheme
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.000]   in that critical position.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.560]   I wasn't ready to make the move I had to make.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.400]   And he was also, I think,
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.000]   a slightly stronger chess player than me.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.040]   I was a great fighter.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.120]   I loved the battle.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.160]   But I think, objectively, he was a better,
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.120]   his name is Peter Svidler.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.760]   He ended up becoming a world-class grandmaster
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.240]   and is just an incredible chess player today.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.300]   At the time, he was just amazingly brilliant,
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.620]   beautiful, fluid mind.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.620]   But I was confident going into the game.
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:48.800]   So I had to make this move that would essentially be,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.020]   his attack was on the king's side,
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.600]   my expansion was on the queen's side.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.800]   I had to remove my final defensive piece
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.440]   from in front of my king, away from my king's side,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.560]   which is super counterintuitive
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.720]   'cause you think you want it to defend your king.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.680]   What I didn't realize is,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.200]   it was like harnessing the power of empty space
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.720]   against aggression.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.660]   His attack needed my defense,
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.760]   like fire needs fuel to burn.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.160]   Moving my last defensive piece,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   his attack couldn't break through.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.120]   But that principle was something
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.320]   I didn't understand at all.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.780]   And so, it's not like I would have found that move.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.840]   But it was a real pop in my mind, right?
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.440]   So then, I was 17, 18 years old,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.160]   and then a year later, I started studying Tai Chi.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.800]   So I was studying Taoist meditation,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.000]   Taoist philosophy, the Tao Te Ching,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.120]   Chuang Tsa, Lao Tsa, the inner chapters.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.160]   And then I get into Tai Chi,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   I started moving meditation,
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.320]   and I started in Tai Chi Chuan, push hands.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.360]   Without making the connection,
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.920]   push hands is the martial art,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.380]   which is like, the essence of push hands
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.000]   is learning to utilize empty space against aggression.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.800]   But I hadn't connected it to that moment.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.120]   And you fast forward to 2004 World Championship,
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.800]   which is what the art of learning ended with,
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.760]   the final chapter of that
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.480]   is the World Championship finals.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.040]   I'm fighting this guy bigger than me,
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.640]   stronger than me, he's been training since childhood.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.420]   Final fight in a big stadium,
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.600]   everyone wanting me to be destroyed
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.760]   in the biggest fight of my life.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.200]   And I won that fight by harnessing the power of empty space,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.620]   by letting him feel my weakness,
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.460]   by leaning on him,
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.000]   by letting it, and then I just, and then disappearing.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.200]   So it's very interesting how there was no mental process,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.560]   there's no conscious processing of that connection.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.280]   But the biggest loss of my chess life,
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.160]   and then the principle,
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160]   which I wasn't ready to understand yet,
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.000]   was how I won the World Championship in the martial arts
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.280]   so many years later.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.120]   And it's a completely different discipline, right?
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.360]   So it's an example of like,
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.920]   and of course that principle is manifested
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.400]   in every part of my life today.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   But that's one of many stories in my life
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.560]   where like, a loss spurs an insight
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.600]   which might consciously or often unconsciously
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.560]   lead to something incredible down the road.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.840]   And I think that one of the biggest challenges
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   that we have,
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.840]   but it's so interesting that the loss
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.840]   of a World Chess Championship final leads to the win.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.080]   The rec lesson was the win of a World Championship
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.680]   in a fighting realm.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.440]   And how common that is.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.520]   And one of the things that I think about,
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.280]   like when you sit down with great competitors,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.360]   again and again, when you hear their inner journey,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.620]   the most heartbreaking losses
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.200]   lead to the transformational change,
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.720]   which leads to the biggest wins of their life.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.120]   Whether it's in basketball,
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.040]   whether it's in fighting,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.000]   whether it's in business, it's in finance,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.080]   it's in writing.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.920]   - Love.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.520]   - Oh, in love, oh my God, in love, yeah.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.920]   - I mean, breakups are devastating.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.960]   They're a death of sorts.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.800]   - Yeah.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.600]   (upbeat music)
