[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.920]   Joshua Sheets is with us.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.000]   He's host of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.720]   It's a top-10 podcast teaching you how to live a rich life now and achieve financial
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.400]   freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.000]   He also hosts a podcast called Encouraging Christian Fathers.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.560]   Joshua, welcome to the show.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.720]   Kind of fill us in a little bit more.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.400]   Tell us about yourself.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.200]   - I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.320]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.600]   Yeah, I came from the background of working as a professional financial advisor, and
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.960]   frankly, Radical Personal Finance is the core of what I do.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.200]   Encouraging Christian Fathers is simply a side project.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.600]   I limited myself on the things that I wanted to talk about on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.320]   and I didn't necessarily make it a religious show.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.680]   And I felt like it would be a bait and switch if I used as a platform for talking about
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.840]   things relating to Christianity.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.680]   So that's just a side project that I do for fun.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.720]   I got frustrated that I couldn't find any good podcasts out there that were specifically
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.080]   targeted to Christian fathers.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.080]   So I said, "Well, let me go and build it."
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.640]   But Radical Personal Finance came out of another sense of frustration.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.920]   I'm picking up on a theme here.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.400]   - No, that's a strong theme.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.080]   I love it.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.400]   - I was a longtime financial advisor and always loved the personal finance world, but I just
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.080]   got so sick and tired of the mainstream financial pundits and the fact that, in my opinion,
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.600]   much of the advice that they gave was wrong.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.280]   And finally, I said, "Somebody who actually has a little bit of a technical, academic,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.760]   professional background in financial planning should jump this chasm over to the world of
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.000]   media."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.120]   So I gave it a little test start and then I wound up finding that, "Hey, I think this
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   is going to work."
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.180]   So I closed my financial planning firm and launched full-time into Radical Personal Finance
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.800]   on July 1, 2014.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.520]   And it's been a wild and bumpy almost two years, but it's been really rewarding.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.240]   - You bring up, and I kind of want to skip to that part right there near the end where
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.220]   you talked about the bumpiness.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.680]   Because I think a lot of people, especially the people listening to this podcast, we've
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.200]   all experienced those bumps in the roads.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.880]   We all have the best laid plans and things go bump along the way.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.800]   You're routed, even in the last almost two years now with your podcast, but even before
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.080]   that, what kind of road bumps and speed bumps?
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.520]   I mean, I'm sure you've experienced some like that.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.000]   Was there one moment that kind of sticks out to you that you really were like, "Wow, the
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.440]   doubt, the fear, am I doing the right thing here by closing up and going down this road
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.440]   with this podcast?"
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.720]   I mean, was there any moment like that for you?
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.000]   - So, I teach financial planning for a living.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.760]   And so I should, in theory, I'll leave it to the listener to judge, but I should in
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.520]   theory have a clue of what I'm doing when it comes to money.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.440]   And the most difficult thing was when I decided to start the show, I had spent six years building
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.600]   a financial planning firm.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.920]   And the interesting thing about the business of financial planning is it is the worst short-term
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.160]   business you can ever be in, ever.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   All of your compensation and profit comes on the back end.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   But the first years of building a financial planning firm, it's a lot of work and not
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.520]   much money.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.800]   And so basically I tell people it takes three years to know if you're going to make it or
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.680]   not, it takes five or six to be stable.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.760]   And then you only start to really reap the profit after about 10 years because you're
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.360]   just constantly reinvesting into infrastructure, building things back up.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.680]   So I had finally, after five years, and the reason I said using five years, five years
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.400]   is when I decided to make the switch, it took me one year to make the extrication plan.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.640]   So it was total of six years.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.720]   But after five years of hard work, I had finally built the business to where I could pull back
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.760]   a little bit on the effort level.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.960]   I had a decent amount of passive income coming in.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.080]   I had a stable financial life.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.320]   I was doing well.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.400]   I had a stable established client base.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.840]   Everything was working finally after years of labor.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:39.040]   And I was married, had my first baby on the way, and decided to turn all of that in for
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.320]   a launch into a business that has no proven business model, that is notoriously finicky,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.240]   this new frontier called podcasting.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.680]   And I decided to put it all on the line and walk away from everything that was safe and
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   secure.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.300]   And let me tell you, I mean, I could say numbers, but it doesn't matter.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.800]   That was an expensive financial decision.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:08.460]   But I did it because I saw what my goals were and I knew I had a hunch that it would work.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.120]   And I'm so glad that I did.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.160]   But the whole process has been very, very difficult.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:22.560]   I mean, five years into, excuse me, four months into my progress with Radical Personal Finance,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.960]   I deleted all my iTunes subscribers accidentally right before I was getting ready to launch
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.040]   a membership site.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.840]   So I had this whole big launch plan and I delete my entire subscriber base due to some
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.080]   error I made.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.200]   I've made every mistake in the books, but I just keep going forward and it's been a
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.760]   very rewarding process.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.980]   You know, you bring up the mistakes and I think everybody at some point experiences
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.040]   some sort of mistake or some sort of problem that unexpected like that.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.880]   Obviously, some mistakes may have more of an effect on us than others.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.840]   But I think what you described is very common among people that I speak with that especially
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.600]   the entrepreneurial spirit, we tend to get very emotional or emotionally attached to
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.960]   our companies, to our visions, to the things that we want to do.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.880]   And as you pointed out there, and maybe this is something that you touch on frequently
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.720]   with your podcast as well, but it sounds like sometimes we can maybe let our emotions get
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.560]   in the way of good judgment and go after something that may sound good in our own head, but if
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.960]   we don't get it really vetted among close personal friends or advisors or that mastermind
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.160]   group, whatever the case may be, we could really be taking ourselves down kind of a
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   rough road ahead.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.760]   I mean, is that kind of what you – it sounds like maybe even you experienced a little bit
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   of that yourself.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.840]   Yeah, it's – so here's where I'll tie in financial planning to the lesson because
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.560]   this is something I really think is valuable.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.520]   Because failure and mistakes are inevitable.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.760]   They're inevitable.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.240]   And I don't think that failure is particularly a mark of shame.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.520]   We're taught that it's a mark of shame, but there's no reason for it to be.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.960]   One of my favorite most encouraging quotes that I return to often was a quote years ago.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.840]   Zig Ziglar used to hammer home into my head.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.560]   He said, "Failure is an event.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.600]   It's not a person.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.720]   You are not a failure.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.880]   You simply fail.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.880]   Failure is an event.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.920]   It's not a person."
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.440]   And when you look at the lives of people who've gone the farthest, you usually find a string
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.880]   of failures littered behind them.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.720]   And people want to get the success without the failure.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.600]   And I'm convinced it's not possible.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.200]   So it's one thing to accept that intellectually, but it's another thing to accept it emotionally.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   And it's tough.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.320]   When I fail at stuff, it's tough.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.960]   But I'm growing and I'm getting better at it.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.820]   I look back at the last decade of my life and I see how much stronger I am.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.300]   So that said, when I started Radical Personal Finance, I had to ignore the advice of almost
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:00.180]   everybody around me because very few people understood.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.060]   From the perspective of actual good business judgment, I don't even recommend what I did
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:11.340]   to other people to close one successful business in order to start an untested, unproven, complete
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.380]   jump off a cliff.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.100]   The reason I had to do it was because as a financial advisor, financial advisors that
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.660]   are licensed with the SEC, you are completely restricted from saying anything interesting
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.500]   or meaningful in public.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.900]   And so I could not maintain my financial planning licenses and say anything in public.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.860]   And so I decided, well, I'm going to have to make this switch.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.620]   So I couldn't do what I would recommend to most people.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.620]   If you want to make a transition, do what Michael Masterson calls chicken entrepreneurship.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.060]   Start something on the side and give it some time and nurse it a little bit and see if
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.360]   it's going to work and make a transition to it.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.620]   I couldn't do that.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.780]   But and nobody believed in the idea.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.380]   Nobody believed in the concept except my dad and my wife.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:01.940]   And even circumstantially, I was facing, I was, you know, again, young family, kid on
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.940]   the way.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.140]   It was just a, it was a difficult decision.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:11.360]   But what I did work to do was to say, well, how can I mitigate the details of failure?
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.980]   And that was where what I teach with financial planning is you can recognize that failure
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.020]   is inevitable and you can judge and know, OK, is it inevitable?
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.540]   We never know what we're going to fail at.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.580]   We know that in time failure is inevitable.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.680]   So let's make sure that when we do fail, we fail in small manageable ways.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.220]   That's risk management.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.900]   And let's also make sure that we've got backup plans.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.100]   So to make the transition of going from a financial planning firm to an untested business,
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.820]   I had to leave financial planning.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.340]   But the way I decided to control for the failure was to go and get another job, something that
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.900]   would be some dead end job that what didn't require me to be emotionally engaged with
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.860]   the future of the enterprise, but rather I just was going and doing a job and coming
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.860]   home.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.900]   And I looked around, worked hard to find something that I could do.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.620]   I thought about selling cars.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.260]   I thought about delivering pizzas.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.860]   I actually went and got a job delivering pizzas for a week.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.540]   Somebody told me you could make 20 bucks an hour doing that.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.540]   I needed to make about twenty five hundred, three thousand dollars a month just to meet
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.220]   my my monthly cost of living.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.460]   And I did it for a week and found out you can't make twenty dollars an hour delivering
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.460]   pizzas.
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.460]   And it was a waste of time.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.460]   But it was it was fun.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.460]   I learned a lot from it.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.460]   But I ultimately wound up get building a part time consulting contract in the financial
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.780]   planning field.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.460]   And so what that did was it controlled the risk of failure where I wasn't putting my
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.740]   family's you know, I wouldn't put in my family's future on the line.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.140]   I wasn't I wasn't betting all of my money on some expensive endeavor.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.220]   I was just potentially taking a detour with my time.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.300]   And that's what I believe is so powerful is by with financial planning.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.340]   The reason one of the reasons why I do what I do and the thing that I do most effectively
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.100]   is help people make a tangible transition from where they are to what they want to do.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.420]   And that's where financial planning people think of it as this this theoretical mystical
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.700]   concept.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.700]   It's not.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.420]   It's a matter of the fact that if you don't if you don't have a lot of expenses, I mean,
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.580]   I could I could support my family on twenty five hundred three thousand bucks a month.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.060]   Well, you can do that delivering pizzas if you want to work enough hours.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.820]   So so then I limit that.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.700]   I limit the impact of failure dramatically, which opens up all of the opportunities.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.660]   So that that's how I engage with failures is limit the impact, recognize that it's it's
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.060]   going to happen.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.660]   But let me make sure that when it happens, I don't get wiped out because failure is no
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.300]   problem to come back from.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.740]   Athletes get hurt.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.900]   You know, people, business people, shut certain lines of business failure fail.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.120]   But if you get completely wiped out, it can be really hard to come back from that.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.540]   So avoid wipe out risk.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.700]   I love that.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.660]   And there are so many things by listening to the podcast.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.940]   I mean, there were so many nuggets of great information that Joshua just share with us
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:51.940]   there.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.620]   And Joshua, I love your story.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.340]   There's a little similarity between you and me is there as well, because you having to
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:03.500]   sever your ties as a financial advisor before you could go into the advice world of a podcast.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.460]   Very similar for me because I worked in at a television station in Birmingham, Alabama,
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.580]   before I started my company.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:15.560]   And with me, with the company being a content marketing company, the contract I was under
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.300]   in television, I really could not do what I was.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.080]   I could not start my company without violating my TV contract.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.700]   So, you know, there was I experienced that very similar thing of not being able to really
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.260]   start the business and test it and see if it was going to work before quitting my main
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.260]   job.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.780]   And so I certainly understand that.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.980]   But I love how you put this.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.020]   And for everybody listening, one of the big takeaways that I take from this is this idea
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.540]   of when we do fail, because it's not if.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.780]   And I think a lot of entrepreneurs, maybe the first time out especially, just don't
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.780]   understand this.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.220]   But just like baseball players are going to strike out more often than they get a hit,
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:56.740]   when we do fail, having that backup plan, being able to manage that in small, manageable
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:02.740]   ways, I absolutely love how you describe that, because that is something that I try to pray
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.180]   and preach to people that especially like college students and young adults that are
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.460]   coming up wanting to start their own business, hey, this is real life here and things are
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.460]   going to happen.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.980]   You've got to be prepared for that.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.500]   And I absolutely love how you describe that.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.720]   That is fantastic.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.540]   Let me kind of switch, Joshua, a little bit here about strategy, because obviously the
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.940]   podcast has become a big thing for you.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.100]   Would you say, well, let me phrase it like this.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.020]   A lot of businesses, a lot of people have preached over the years that in order to be
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.220]   successful on the digital side, you've got to first start with a website, you've got
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.880]   to have a blog, so forth, so on.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.420]   Does that still apply in the year 2016, or are we seeing things like podcasts become
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.660]   just as important or more important on the digital side?
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.340]   It's not either/or.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.340]   I think it's a matter of a strategy.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:01.060]   When I set out to start Radical Personal Finance, I thought through what I had to offer and
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.820]   what the opportunity was that I perceived in the marketplace.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:14.020]   And what I perceived as the white space opportunity was that there wasn't a podcast that was delivering
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:22.140]   major depth of content, nor a wide breadth of content, and there wasn't a podcast that
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.580]   was delivering a lot of content.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.860]   So the reason I home in on those things is because that's what I built Radical Personal
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.860]   Finance.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.860]   That was my theory.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.120]   I was looking for a show that I would want to listen to.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.840]   And I have a strong academic background in financial planning, and so I was looking for
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.840]   a little bit of academics.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.260]   But man, I don't want to talk about the tax code every day.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.020]   That's just horrible.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.340]   So I wanted a little bit of tax code to make me smarter, but I also wanted something a
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.340]   little bit interesting.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.740]   I wanted to hear some interesting subjects, not just the same old, same old every day.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.940]   So I was looking for variety, and I was also looking for depth.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.540]   I get so frustrated by the five-minute TV interview.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.440]   I want to hear what somebody actually thinks.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.980]   And so my theory was I'm going to build the show that I would want to listen to.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.260]   And hey, if someone else wants to tune into that, great.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.980]   So I've done shows on the lessons we can learn from homeless people and vagabonds.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.380]   I interview people that live in cars and don't have any money.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.780]   I interview people who are multimillionaires and talk about what they've learned.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.900]   I do deep dives on tax planning, on retirement accounts.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.020]   I talk to people who don't save money.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.740]   People who say I try to keep it interesting, and I try to keep it in depth.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.860]   Now, it is an exhausting process to do that.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:42.700]   But that was the opportunity that I saw, and that was what I tried to build my platform
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.700]   on.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.820]   I've gotten a little distracted on-- rephrase the question you asked me.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.820]   That was my intro.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.820]   I forgot why I got it.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   I went for that.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.820]   No, it was a great description.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.380]   But the idea from a platform perspective, though, because a lot of people-- the whole
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.820]   website and app thing or blog versus some people like, I'm just going to build my business
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.140]   on Facebook and all, or podcasts.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.380]   Is there one platform you start with?
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.380]   Yes.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.380]   Thanks.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.940]   And I knew it was an important question, and I just-- forgive me.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.780]   I had gotten a little off track in my mind.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:18.860]   So the reason I went into that was that my competitive specialty, I decided, was going
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:24.580]   to be verbal content, lots of it, in-depth verbal content.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.940]   And so I put up the bare minimum website for the first year and a year plus.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.360]   I just had the standard WordPress-themed website.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.660]   In retrospect, if I knew what I knew now about the technology, I never would have launched
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.380]   a WordPress site at that stage.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.740]   And I focused exclusively on the audio content.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.140]   I did a lot of mistakes.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.900]   I never focused on massively improving the email list.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.200]   I just focused on the audio content.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.420]   And so my only thing I wanted was for people to connect with the audio and to subscribe
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.160]   to the show on an audio basis.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.780]   That was my starting point.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.260]   And that was-- the reason I did that was because I couldn't do everything.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.940]   I didn't have the capacity.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.540]   I had never been a broadcaster.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.040]   I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.660]   And so I said, I'm going to focus exclusively on creating the best and the most audio content
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.980]   that I can, and I'm going to focus on my skills there.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.840]   Now on that foundation, that worked.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.720]   And my show grew a lot.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.820]   It doesn't mean that everything else wasn't important.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.820]   It doesn't mean that the website wasn't important.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.300]   It doesn't mean that Facebook wasn't important.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.540]   It's just that I couldn't do all those things simultaneously.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.180]   And so I said, I'm going to focus exclusively on my core skill now.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.940]   Now since that time, I've since expanded my capacity.
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.580]   I became much more skillful as a broadcaster.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.300]   I became much more reliable and consistent with my ability to create the content.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.460]   And I expanded the financial model, the income behind it, where I could afford to go ahead
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.640]   and hire things.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.780]   And so since that time, I've gone ahead and built a really strong website.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.980]   And I've gone ahead and focused, and I'm still focused, on massively improving all
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.460]   of those other aspects, and to good effect.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.820]   So I get a much better response now when people look at my website, and they take me for a
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:10.100]   bigger deal because of the strength and the beauty and the impressiveness of my website.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.740]   So it's made a difference.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.380]   But the problem was, the problem with the advice of you got to do it all is you can't
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.380]   do it all.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.720]   So you got to pick what can I actually do.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.180]   And I chose to focus on the podcast platform, the verbal content first.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.100]   If I were going to do it over again, I would do it exactly that same way.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.700]   I would ignore everything else.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.420]   I mean, I had an extra Twitter account.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.420]   I shut that down.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.940]   The Facebook page, not all that big a deal.
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.260]   I just focused on the podcast content.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.300]   So I say, start with where you're going to compete.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   I've seen people in the social media space, YouTubers.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.700]   If you're going to build it on YouTube, just focus exclusively on YouTube, and then later
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.660]   you can expand out the website.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.460]   In a perfect world, would you like to have everything ready to go at once?
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.460]   Yes.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.780]   And if you're a large company, a large business, you have resources, there's no reason not
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.660]   to be excellent in as many areas as possible.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.940]   But for me, as poor little old me, I only could be excellent at one thing at a time,
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.980]   and I believe that's a more effective strategy is start with one thing, master it, and then
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:10.980]   move on.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:17.140]   So that whole concept of just deep diving into one area and get really, really, really,
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.140]   really good at that before you branch out is so critical.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:25.220]   And the people that I talk to that are successful, like you, have done exactly that.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.860]   And I think that's a really big lesson for people listening that may be wanting to start
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.360]   out or starting out their small business, their entrepreneur.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.460]   Get really good at one thing.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.740]   Become known for being good at one thing, and then you can branch out from there.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.340]   Let me ask you this, Josh.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.620]   When it comes to now that you've built this out, the podcast is successful, the website
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:51.060]   is bigger and better and helps and a great asset to that.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:57.420]   As far as other social media platforms go, do you use those to help push the primary
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.900]   core focus of the podcast and the website?
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:05.340]   And if you do, how do you use social media to get traction?
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:12.020]   So as far as marketing my brand, what I have learned is that my personal, I use three social
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.140]   media platforms for producing content that's different than consuming.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.040]   But at the moment, I just use Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.460]   I ignore Twitter because I don't enjoy the platform.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.460]   I don't like it.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.900]   I think it's pointless.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.900]   But I do it because it's easy.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.260]   And we could talk about that if you want to go into it.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.740]   But I just do it because it's easy.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.900]   I publish some tweets every now and then.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.580]   I enjoy spending time on Instagram.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.300]   That's the only of the major social, the only networks I spend any time on are YouTube and
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   Instagram.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.580]   But Facebook is the most important for me as far as connecting with people.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.580]   And so Facebook is where I have the largest community.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.580]   Facebook is where people can interact with me in a way that is impactful.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.940]   So that's where I focus my time and where I have focused my time is building better
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.780]   marketing through there.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.380]   Now as far as marketing the show content, there are two aspects to it.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:06.700]   Marketing the show content, what I try to do is build everything off of Instagram and
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:11.860]   use similar content that goes, starts in Instagram, passes through to Facebook where I also do
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.100]   it on Facebook, and then passes through to Twitter automatically.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.820]   So that works for me because I enjoy that.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.400]   And as far as the biggest value of Facebook, however, is engaging with other people, specifically
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.500]   in the group for my show.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.500]   I have a paid group that I've set up.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.500]   And that's where I spend my time.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.180]   I'm using it as basically a forum for me to interact with my listeners.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.260]   And that's where I spend the most time on a social network.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.260]   It's really, really good.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.140]   And for everybody listening to the podcast today, I mean, the key takeaway there is it's
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.340]   a very – Joshua understands his audience.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.860]   He understands what works and what doesn't.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.820]   And once you get that clarity, it's much easier for you to get traction on social media.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.840]   If you know who your target audience is, then you can start to identify where they live.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:02.180]   But also just understanding what you're passionate about and where you enjoy being because if
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.020]   you don't enjoy being on a platform, your audience is going to – at some point going
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.620]   to notice that as well.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.100]   And I think that's a really big takeaway there.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:20.740]   Joshua, let me ask you this because most businesses, most people, at some point we interact with
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:26.220]   someone that, for lack of a better term, is that angry customer, that someone that is
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:31.080]   reaching out to us and thanks to social media, it's so easy for people to just vent their
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:36.020]   frustrations without a filter and without thinking about it and sleeping on it.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:41.700]   Is there a strategy that you use to deal with people that vent to you on social media?
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:47.020]   So I get a good amount of this because of some of the topics that I cover on my show.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:52.180]   I don't mind controversy and so I cover subjects that are controversial.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.100]   I interview people who are tax protesters.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.620]   I interview people with strong convictions.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:03.540]   We talk about subjects that are uncomfortable in mainstream life and so – and I have opinions
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.020]   that are uncomfortable in mainstream life.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.020]   And so when I talk about it, I get a lot of feedback.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.740]   I think that my way of handling that is simple.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.180]   Number one, I'm going to be a person and I'm going to be straightforward and honest
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.660]   in all that I do.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.980]   And so if somebody is angry because I made a mistake, I'm going to acknowledge the
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.580]   mistake and I'm going to fix it.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.740]   I'm not perfect.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.740]   None of us are perfect.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.980]   We're all going to make mistakes.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:32.220]   If I said something that was inappropriate, if I did something that was wrong, then the
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.820]   only standard that I can handle is simply to make it right.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:41.740]   And so I believe that the best thing to do is simply to make it right and that the normal
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.420]   people of life will recognize that you're doing that.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.500]   Now on the other hand, if I didn't do something that was wrong or I didn't do something
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.780]   that was right, I just – I think in general, just ignore it because the internet has a
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.580]   bunch of – I mean the world has some crazy people in it.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.740]   But the internet somehow allows the crazy people to come out of the woodwork where there's
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.500]   no filter between them.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:08.460]   And so most people who are rational, reasonable people recognize that and they just simply
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.260]   filter and tune out – they filter and tune things out.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.340]   And so I don't see any reason to try to control what people say.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:23.580]   I believe that – so the world that we live in in 2016 is amazing.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:29.860]   And I love the fact that anybody in the world can establish a platform to communicate with
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.940]   other people.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.700]   This is the greatest time in human history to be alive for many reasons.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.820]   But one reason is because of the openness and freedom of speech that is available.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.720]   This has never been there before and it's accomplishing a dramatic transformation of
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.360]   our society.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.180]   It also comes with some difficult things.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.020]   One of those difficult things is crazy people are given a platform for things.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.940]   And so I think depending on where you're at, you just move on and ignore it.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.340]   But I'll tell you, there are certainly some leaders I go to and I go and read other people's
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.340]   Twitter replies.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.860]   I go and read their comment sections and whatnot, people who have it far worse than I do just
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.740]   to get a sense of what's going on.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.340]   I think the reasonable way to handle it is based upon the brand.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:18.580]   There's no reason for some brands and some opportunities to have just junk on your page.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.180]   And so I certainly do not allow things that are obscene on any of my stuff.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.740]   But I don't mind a good debate, but I don't allow things that are obscene.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:32.300]   And I think a good way to filter it out is by eliminating public comments at some times
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.460]   and moving things into a paid version.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:40.220]   I pay very little attention to what people say about me who aren't paying customers.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.340]   I pay a lot of attention to the members of my community who are paying customers and
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.940]   I listen to them very carefully.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.940]   Love that.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.940]   Great, great advice.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.940]   All right.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.020]   So before we wrap up the strategy portion of the podcast here, I do want to ask you,
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.740]   but if someone listening today, let's say they've listened this far and they're like,
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   "You know what?
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.820]   I mean, the whole podcast thing is great.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.500]   What Joshua's doing is fantastic.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.500]   I need to be more involved.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.460]   I need to – my business, I know I'm not going to grow my business without getting
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.220]   more involved on digital, on website, on podcast," whatever the case may be.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.620]   What's the first step for them?
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.980]   What's that first thing that someone needs to do in order to get moving in the right
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.980]   direction?
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.620]   You should never get involved with something that you don't know about.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.740]   I can't stand the advice of, "Well, you got to be on Facebook."
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.740]   People ask me this all the time.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.740]   You got to be on Facebook.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.500]   Listen, if you don't use Facebook, don't get involved on Facebook.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.260]   If you want to get involved on Facebook, start just by becoming a user.
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.500]   Don't try to take your marketing message there.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.460]   What people have often gotten confused on is they've confused the idea of a platform
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:49.300]   and a tool with the ideas of content and strategy.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:53.980]   A podcast can serve many different functions, but there's no difference in a podcast versus
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.180]   all the things people have done before except that we're simply delivering the content
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.800]   digitally.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.980]   You could build a very successful local marketing arm for your local real estate business by
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.500]   having a Saturday morning radio station show on the AM radio station.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:13.860]   You can also build a very successful, effective marketing platform for your message by having
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:19.180]   an answering machine recorded message listed on your Yellow Pages ad.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:23.380]   Depending on your business, you probably should be doing both of those things still.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:31.260]   What podcasting is, it's simply a way to communicate verbal content in a very inexpensive format.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:36.540]   What I believe will be the future is many people will be using podcasts in an effective
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.180]   way, but it's got to be appropriate to your business.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.540]   So if I were starting, a simple example, my show Radical Personal Finance is intended
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.500]   to be a large public market show.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.300]   That's the space that I'm choosing to compete in.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:55.140]   I'm going after the large markets, trying to establish myself as an authority on a broad
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.460]   scale subject.
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:02.620]   However, if I were running a local community group, I would also have a podcast and I would
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:08.660]   just simply use it as a way of connecting with the 10 or 15 people in an effective,
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:13.460]   simple way that connecting with those people with the content that we're trying to distribute
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.020]   and share among ourselves.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.780]   And so the podcast is not the benefit.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.220]   It's just simply the tool that we're using to convey written, excuse me, verbal content.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.960]   And the same people have effectively used in the past, again, that recorded answering
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.100]   machine line, the radio show, the podcast, and they'll be using whatever it is tomorrow.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.860]   But the podcast is a tool that we're using to communicate with the people that we're
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.860]   trying to reach out to.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.500]   And so the key is to recognize first, what am I doing?
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.580]   And then what skills and attributes do I bring to the table?
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.780]   And how should I get involved with it?
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.980]   And then the other question you have to ask is, who is the right person to get involved
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.980]   with this?
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:55.760]   One of my favorite examples, he's a total curmudgeon, but if anybody is familiar with
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.100]   direct response marketing, they'll know this name, but a man named Dan Kennedy.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:05.140]   Dan Kennedy is a copywriting coach and advisor and direct marketing expert who has written
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:10.560]   and influenced more content in the direct marketing industry than almost anybody else.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.100]   But as far as I know, to this day, this was the case a couple of years ago, Dan Kennedy
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.440]   does not have email.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.220]   He doesn't take phone calls that are not pre-scheduled.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:25.140]   The only way that you can communicate with Dan Kennedy is via fax.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:30.560]   And as far as I know, that's still the case, but in about 2012, 2013, that was the case
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.980]   because I wanted to contact him.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.420]   I had to send him a fax, but he replied to me by fax.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:41.720]   Now Dan Kennedy has a massive online presence, but as far as I can tell, he is not the one
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.800]   running it.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.920]   He is the man who's responsible for the content, but he's not the one running it.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.140]   And so what I love about that example is he has chosen to spend his time on where he's
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.100]   most effective and for him to go out and give public information in a Facebook thing and
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.420]   say I'm going to go and troll this Facebook group, he is the world's leading expert in
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.460]   his space.
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.780]   And if you want to communicate with Dan Kennedy, you must fax him.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.940]   That's how you do it.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.540]   But it works and he's sought after and he's made a lot of money doing it.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:13.180]   So this idea that somehow the platform is the magic is nonsense.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.540]   It's you and your message and your content and your strategy and you choose the platform
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.380]   that's going to most effectively serve your purposes and then you adapt over time.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.180]   And so you go from writing a, forgive me for going long.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.180]   It's just that I get frustrated.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.180]   No, no.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.180]   This is so great.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.180]   This is awesome.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.180]   So, okay.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.580]   So just to expand it for just a moment.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.860]   When you look at, for example, the experts industry that I'm a part of, the strategy
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.820]   has never changed.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.380]   The most effective people write columns in newspapers, they write books, and now they
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.100]   just simply take that writing and they bring it over to blogging, they bring it over to
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.860]   their Facebook posts, they bring it over to a slightly different format, but it's never
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:51.860]   changed.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.860]   It's always been the same.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.140]   You wrote brochures and pamphlets in the 1700s.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.820]   Today you write eBooks and Facebook posts and brochures and pamphlets and you create
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.900]   some YouTube videos and whatever we're doing 30 years from now, there'll be no difference
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:04.980]   of what you're doing.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:10.060]   You're just using a slightly different medium and you're adapting to the medium that's there.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:14.340]   And once you grasp that, I think it allows you to make a much better decision and you're
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.580]   seeing the principles rather than the current tools and tactics, whatever they happen to
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.580]   be.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.580]   Love that.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.980]   There's so much gold there.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.820]   And I love how you put it, the podcast is not the benefit, it's simply the tool that
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.420]   we use to deliver the content.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.580]   And as you pointed out, can it be applied to any platform?
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.700]   You know, the platform is not the benefit, it's the content and what you're teaching
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:40.500]   people and sharing with people and how you're serving them, that's the benefit.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.740]   And once you stay focused on that, the platforms take care of themselves.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.740]   That is fantastic.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.460]   Joshua, let's move into the success round here.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.740]   And I've got five questions I want to ask you because as I've been interviewing people,
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.740]   what I've come to understand is there are a lot of similarities among successful people.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:04.260]   People that achieve their goals on a regular basis do so in very similar ways with other
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.300]   successful people.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.620]   So I always like to kind of see the similarities and maybe the subtle differences as well into
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.140]   how the things you do on a daily, weekly basis to be successful.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:18.060]   So the first thing is, the first question is, what do you do each day to avoid distractions
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.780]   and focus on your goals?
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:23.300]   You're not going to like this one.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.900]   I don't follow anyone on social media.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:31.380]   And by that I mean, by Facebook feed, I have unfollowed every single person on there.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.620]   On Twitter, with the exception of about a week ago where I added eight or nine people,
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.060]   I don't follow a single person on Twitter.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.820]   The only, and Instagram for months I followed nobody.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.460]   I recently went ahead and added some more people.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.180]   But I don't follow anyone on social media.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:50.620]   And the reason is it's so easy to get lost in the social media tunnel and you find yourself
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.140]   exploring all kinds of different things.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.700]   And so what I have learned to do is for now, at least for this stage, maybe I'll change
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:01.660]   in the future, but because I have far more work than I have the time to be able to accomplish,
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:05.220]   I don't want to lose those minutes and wasted passive time.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.220]   I want to use those minutes in focused effort.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:13.420]   So the only social media platforms that I actually engage with is some I follow people
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.300]   on YouTube and some on Instagram.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.900]   But beyond that, I follow nobody.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.780]   And that eliminates those passive rabbit trails from my life.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.360]   That is, you know, it's funny you brought that up because I think a lot of people do
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.900]   get very distracted with social media and it just, it sucks their time away.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.140]   But that's not a bad way of fixing that.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:35.940]   I mean, I've heard a lot of people say, well, you just need to block out time on your calendar
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:40.780]   and only do this for 15 minutes and then move on to something else and block times.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:46.300]   But if you unfollow everybody or don't follow anybody, that's just as effective because
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.020]   there's nothing to see when you go there if you're not following anybody.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.860]   I love that.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.060]   Question number two is what is your number one goal right now?
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.820]   My number one goal is to fix my business.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.060]   And by fix, I mean in this way.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.540]   When I started the business, I didn't know if I would be able to build an audience.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.660]   And so I focused exclusively on the front end business.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.660]   So the front end revenue of my business is the only revenue that exists.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.460]   So front end revenue is advertisers and then listener support.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.940]   I have a tips model using a website called Patreon that people can support me financially
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.100]   in exchange for the work that I do.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.060]   But I don't have the back end business built.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:26.340]   I don't have all the products, courses, seminars, books, e-books, all that stuff.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.300]   None of that stuff is built.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.140]   And I knew that if I simply built an audience, I could build the back end stuff.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.700]   So I focused on doing the audience first.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:40.380]   But at this point, I'm laser focused on fixing the business and building out the back end
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.540]   products.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.660]   What are you doing each day to achieve that goal?
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.820]   I am dramatically reducing the things that are on my to do list.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.660]   So it took a little while, but I've pulled myself out, for example, for me of most of
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.660]   my podcast production process.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.100]   I've pulled myself out of doing anything on my website.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:04.260]   I'm pulling myself out of a lot of the social media marketing stuff.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.900]   And so pulling that out so that I can focus on what I do, which is creating the content.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.900]   And so I've hired a few people.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.380]   I have a web developer who runs a website.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.980]   I have a graphic designer who does that.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.540]   I have some other people who are helping me volunteering with some of the other back end
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.540]   stuff.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.840]   And it's taken me a while to be able to put that into play.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.820]   But now that I've done that, it frees up a lot of time where I can focus on my $10,000
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.340]   an hour work instead of my $200 an hour work.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.340]   Absolutely.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.340]   It's the key.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.300]   It absolutely is key to success.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:40.300]   What roadblocks or obstacles slow you down from achieving your goal?
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.420]   Emotional variability is my biggest challenge.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:49.220]   I go through all of the same daily emotions and ups and downs that a lot of people do.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:56.960]   And what I find is I have a tendency to ride the cycles.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.140]   And so I work, work, work, work, work, work, work, and then I get a little bit burned out
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.620]   and then pull back, pull back.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:09.360]   And so what I'm working to do is to be more proactive and to implement what Dan Sullivan
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.500]   teaches about entrepreneurial time management.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.560]   Basically the functional difference is this.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.060]   In the bureaucratic world, in the corporate world, what we do is we work, work, work,
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:26.060]   work, work, work, work so that we can justify the free time and justify our vacation.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:31.740]   But the problem is in a creative endeavor like I have, I need that creative edge.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:37.740]   I need that sense of being fresh and refreshed in order to accomplish things, in order to
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.860]   create.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.280]   And so you flip that model in the Dan Sullivan model, you flip it on its head and you first
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.380]   schedule your free time and then you schedule your buffer days so that you have your days
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.820]   where you're going to be dealing with the minutia, dealing with the email, and then
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.140]   you schedule your focus days.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:56.160]   Where on this focus day, the only thing that you do is create this project, do this project.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.140]   And so that's what I'm working to implement to control those emotional ups and downs.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.220]   I haven't perfected it yet, but I'm working on it.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.220]   I love that.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:10.100]   I absolutely, because I think a lot of entrepreneurs, you know, you've got a business and you've
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:15.080]   got clients, you're dealing with people and you almost maybe feel guilty about scheduling
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:22.660]   even a half of a vacation day or a long weekend or worse, a full week off because you're afraid
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.500]   that people are going to be, "You know, you're not taking care of me.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   You're off taking care of yourself and not taking care of me."
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:35.020]   And, you know, maybe that fear is in our minds, but knowing how important that is to the process
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:40.020]   of personal growth and business growth, I absolutely love how you describe that.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:45.380]   Fifth question, name a resource like Skype, like we're using for this interview today,
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:50.420]   or something, some sort of digital tool that helps you achieve your goals.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.980]   Voice dictation.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:59.100]   So one of the things that's so helpful to me is having voice dictation.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.940]   I have a new, and this is probably the best productivity tool I bought, I don't know,
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.940]   some months ago.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.620]   I went ahead and bought the newest iPhone 6S Plus.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:12.220]   That thing has been worth its weight and, I mean, it's been worth a ton.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.180]   As far as the productivity that's allowed me to do, just having a phone that just works
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.000]   well, it's been a tremendous resource for me.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.180]   One thing that's great about it is its voice dictation works really well.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:30.420]   And then also getting and having Dragon naturally speaking on my computer is the other thing.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.980]   And voice dictation has often been a frustration for me in the past.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.740]   If you've tried past versions, it's not been all that good.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.460]   And you feel like you spend more time correcting it than using it.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.940]   But at the current iterations of Dragon and at the current iterations of dictation on
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.040]   the phone, it's really good.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.660]   And that helps so much, especially with social media, to be able to respond, to write those
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.900]   Facebook posts, et cetera.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.860]   Voice dictation has made a huge benefit for me.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.860]   I love that.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.100]   You know, I remember back in the days when I would call and leave myself a voicemail
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.180]   on my phone at work because I'd be driving down the road and would think of something
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.180]   and I'd be like, "Well, I can't write it down right now."
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.900]   So it was just really easy to call the voicemail.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.180]   But now with dictation like that, it's so, so easy.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.180]   All right.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.180]   So final question for you today.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:20.540]   If money was no problem, what is the one thing you would want to do each day?
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:27.020]   So I hope this doesn't – I mean, I'm already doing it.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.660]   And so money is not a problem.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.180]   And I'm not saying that in a cavalier sense.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.500]   I'm simply conveying the reality that money is not a problem.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.060]   And as a financial advisor, it's something that you have to work with and you have to
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.660]   figure out the constraints of it.
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.140]   But money is generally not the problem.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.900]   It's usually something else.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.760]   So for me, the one thing that I want to do every day is have the ability to linger over
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.300]   breakfast with my family if I want to.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.680]   Years ago I read a book when I was working in the corporate world called Why Work Sucks
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.180]   and How to Fix It.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:01.660]   And it was a new book at the time and the authors were talking about how the difference
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:10.380]   between self-autonomy and the corporate lifestyle was that if you – it was how you approach
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.940]   Saturday versus Wednesday.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:19.340]   On Saturday, most adults have a list of things they want to get done and they know what's
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.340]   going to be required.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.900]   But if they want to sit down and have blueberry pancakes with their kids on Saturday morning,
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.020]   they can do that and then they know they're going to get to their work and they can choose
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.340]   when they want to do their work.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.300]   And sometimes you choose to linger over blueberry pancakes and you choose to work during kids'
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.020]   nap times or after you put the kids in bed to get your work done.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.460]   But the difference between that versus the corporate world was that if you do that on
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.700]   Wednesday morning and if you want to linger with your kids over pancakes, then you've
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.300]   got to come up with some kind of excuse to make that work in your job.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.860]   Well, sorry, there was traffic or I had an appointment.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.060]   Half people wind up lying.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.500]   And it's ridiculous for an adult to have to lie and just – why can't you just say
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.320]   I lingered over pancakes?
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.000]   And so what I learned – I mean the book was good, it had good thoughts.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.060]   But what I've learned is that for me, the biggest benefit of entrepreneurship or of
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:12.080]   anything is having control over your day and having control over the time that you do things.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.300]   And so I'm doing now what I would be doing if I had 10 million bucks in the bank.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.980]   There would be some a few adjustments.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.820]   I'd probably do a couple fewer shows.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:27.540]   I'd probably hire more stuff done and get rid of more of the junk work that I don't
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   love doing.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.540]   But you know what?
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.540]   Give me a couple of years and I'll have that done.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.540]   I'm working on it.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.580]   But to me, the biggest thing is simply the control over your time and being able to linger
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.500]   over blueberry pancakes if you want to.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.380]   I love that answer.
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.420]   That is fantastic.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.780]   How can people get in touch with you, Joshua?
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.860]   Best way if anyone wants to check out the show, just search the App Store on your phone
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.220]   for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.540]   That's where I do the show.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.060]   I do it probably about three to four episodes a week right now.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:55.280]   And it's all about living a rich life now while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.140]   in 10 years or less.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.500]   And then also I do another one that's a hobby.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.380]   It's called Encouraging Christian Fathers.
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.740]   If there's any men in the audience who are Christian fathers that would be interested,
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.300]   I do that one with my 73-year-old dad.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.660]   And so it's two fathers that do the show together.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.660]   73-year-old father of seven adult children.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.900]   That's my dad, ages 30 to 50.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:20.600]   And then me, a 30-year-old father of two children, ages eight months and two and a half.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.020]   And so there's free apps to both of those shows in the App Store.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.580]   And that's the best way to check out the show.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.580]   That is great.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.620]   We'll get links to those in the show notes for everybody today.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.380]   Joshua, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.500]   It was a fantastic conversation.

[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:05.820]   Once we stopped running, I found out what it was we was running about.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:06.820]   And Paul Rodriguez.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.820]   What is it about old Mexican men?
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   They could be missing a leg, they still want to get into a fight.
