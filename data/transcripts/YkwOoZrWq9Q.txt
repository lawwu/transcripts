[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.720]   Alright, our first question comes from Shankar, who asks,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.040]   "How do I avoid burnout due to deep work?"
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.360]   He elaborates, "It is clear to me that time blocking and deep work are useful
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.400]   for my career advancement, but I have found that constantly
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.600]   forcing myself to do hard things leads to burnout.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.200]   Instead, following my gut and working from list,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.040]   as David Allen suggests, seems to be healthier. How would you advise one
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.920]   should avoid burnout while working with time blocking and deep
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.920]   work?" Well, Shankar, if you're burning out, I would say do less
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.480]   work as opposed to making the work you do less effective.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.400]   This is one of the key ideas in my still developing philosophy of slow
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.600]   productivity, which is focusing on less things but
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.720]   doing those things better is almost always the right formula, almost always
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.840]   the right formula for producing the best quality work, but also
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.600]   the right formula for keeping your working life as sustainable as
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.840]   possible. So it is really intense. When you're time blocking,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.440]   it's intense. People are going to wonder, "Why did you not respond to my text
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.760]   messages? How do you not know about what's going on in the world?" Because
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.880]   you're locked in doing one thing after another. You know what you're supposed to
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.680]   be doing, and that's what you do whether you feel like it or not.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.800]   When you're doing deep work, no distraction, no context shift, full
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.600]   concentration on the thing I'm doing, you're going to produce much better work,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.560]   but it is draining. There's only so much of this you can do.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.800]   So do less. Put breaks into your time block schedule.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.640]   End your day earlier. Pull back on the number of projects that you're giving
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.200]   intense deep work to. I think that's going to
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.480]   be the right formula, right? As opposed to saying, "Let me just stop
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.840]   tracking so carefully what I'm doing." As opposed to saying, "Let me just sort of
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.520]   think what do I want to do next and move from inboxes back over to
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.200]   random to-do list." That's going to give you a pleasing sense
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.640]   of generic busyness. Urgent stuff will probably get taken
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.760]   care of. Big stuff will happen slower, not as well.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.880]   I say do the work right and then figure out what the right amount of work
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:16.960]   is. That's going to be the better formula.
