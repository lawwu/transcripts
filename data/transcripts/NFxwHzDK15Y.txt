[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   So I want to talk today about discipline.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.800]   I've been thinking a lot about this topic as I work on my new book about cultivating
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.680]   a deep life in a distracted world.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.400]   If you want to succeed with that goal, you need discipline.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.420]   So it's worth looking closer at this concept.
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.000]   So here's my plan for today.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.760]   I'll define more specifically what I mean by discipline.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.080]   I'll look closer at how it actually works, then we will leverage this understanding to
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.440]   explore a new strategy, something I call the discipline ladder, for helping you improve
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.480]   your capacity for discipline in your own life.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960]   All right, so let's start with definitions.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.240]   What do we mean when we say discipline?
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.200]   It has a lot of different meanings.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.880]   The way I want to pin it down for our discussion here is the ability to do something that's
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.200]   hard and important even if you don't want to do it in the moment.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.240]   So a big mistake we often make is that we think about discipline as being an abstract
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.840]   binary trait, something you have or you don't.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.160]   In this type of thinking, a "disciplined" person could just go out and do hard things,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.720]   and an "undisciplined" person can't do anything hard.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.120]   This is not actually how it works.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.680]   Discipline is not like eye color.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.520]   It's an ascriptive trait that you just have or don't have.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.040]   It's a capacity.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.560]   It's a capacity that can vary between people, and it can vary with the same person between
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.840]   different times of their lives.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.480]   So to simply say, "I am disciplined," that's way too vague.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.620]   It's like saying, "I'm a runner."
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.520]   That doesn't mean much to me until I know how fast you can actually run.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280]   So the same holds for discipline.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.040]   There's many different gradations of discipline capacity, and what matters is where exactly
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.160]   you are on that scale.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.400]   So let's talk today about how we can actually increase your discipline capacity, and to
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.920]   do so, I want to get technical.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.480]   What happens inside your brain and your body when you decide to take on a hard task, something
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.480]   that requires discipline?
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.560]   Like, "Okay, I want to write a newsletter essay or go do a hard workout."
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.040]   There is a strong physiological response to this intention, even as you just begin to
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.640]   consider doing the task.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   Chemicals will spread throughout your body and your brain that will give you potentially
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.780]   a sense of aversion to that task.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.120]   At the same time, easier alternative activities will suddenly emerge in your mind as being
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.460]   appealing, sort of increasingly appealing.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.960]   Think about this, right?
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.560]   Last time you sat down at your computer to do something hard, while you had that instinct
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.860]   to rotate through a bunch of news sites or news feeds or social media sites.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.280]   Suddenly that became very appealing just as you were considering doing something hard.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   Let's give a name to this chemical reaction.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.720]   I call it the chemical obstacle to focused reaction.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.160]   So it's like this chemical obstacle is something that emerges as you consider doing something
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.760]   hard and it persists even as you begin that hard action.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.200]   Then we could say it requires you to overcome this chemical obstacle and continue through
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.680]   towards the action that you want to complete.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.280]   Therefore your discipline capacity, this is not abstract, it's not a character trait,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.720]   it's not mysterious.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.160]   We can describe it as a combination of two things.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.600]   The magnitude of the chemical obstacle to focused action that you face, so how intense
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.000]   is that aversion, and the size of such chemical obstacles that you are comfortable overcoming.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.240]   The combination of those two things tells you how hard of something you can actually
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.400]   tackle in your own life.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.040]   All right, so how do we improve this capacity?
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.720]   There's a couple of direct strategies that we already know about, right?
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.400]   Dedicated locations, so having a location that you only use for working on particular
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.860]   discipline requiring activities.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.000]   That works because it reduces the distraction and therefore reduces the level of the chemical
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.200]   obstacle to focused reaction.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.440]   Action, nootropic drugs, like you would assign to someone who has attention deficit hyperactivity
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.720]   disorder.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.000]   They also directly help discipline capacity by increasing your ability to overcome the
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.240]   chemical obstacles that are there.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.960]   So we have these types of solutions that directly help your discipline capacity that we can
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.480]   understand now more clearly when we understand what actually determines discipline capacity.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.000]   Today I want to give you another technique that can help here, and it's what I call the
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.840]   discipline ladder.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:52.760]   Now the idea here is that you can practice overcoming these obstacles, that with practice
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.040]   your discipline capacity can increase, and this comes for two reasons.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.800]   As you practice doing hard things and pushing through into those hard things are complete,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.000]   two things happen.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.680]   One, you become more comfortable with the physiological feeling of the chemical obstacle
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   to focused activity.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.760]   You just are used to it, just like an athlete gets used to the muscle burn of a particular
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   athletic event.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.960]   It doesn't scare them or push them off.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.520]   They just know this is part of it, or like, you know, it's baseball season, a relief pitcher
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.360]   just gets used to the nerves.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.720]   I'm going to feel really, really bad as I'm about to walk out in game two of the NLDS.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.520]   I'm going to feel really bad anxiety.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   It's going to feel really bad.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.520]   I'm used to that.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   That's what it feels to be a pitcher.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.680]   That's the job, is can you throw this ball hard even when your body is in this really
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.840]   innervated state?
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.480]   The second thing that comes with practice of discipline activities is you become more familiar
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.520]   with the rewards of actually completing this work.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.760]   Your reward circuits encode this, so your mind now has positive associations with the
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.040]   hard task you're considering taking on, therefore the size of the chemical obstacle to focused
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.960]   active activity reduces, right?
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.720]   So with practice, we become more used to it, and we reduce the obstacle we have to overcome.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.000]   Doing hard things, in other words, makes us easier to do hard things.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.920]   Now, the problem here is this is circular logic.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.520]   I have to finish hard things so that I'll be able to finish hard things.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.020]   Circular.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.920]   So how do we break that recursion?
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.880]   We systematically ladder up the difficulty of the hard things we do.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   You start with things that are pretty easy but still require discipline, and then as
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.860]   you get used to completing those, you move up to a slightly more difficult ask.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.840]   Slightly more discipline is required.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.440]   Once you accomplish those regularly, you move up to the next level.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.840]   So you ladder yourself systematically up levels of difficulty, and you're systematic about
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   this.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.880]   Just like if you're a weightlifter, you have to keep increasing the level of weight you're
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.320]   lifting for your muscle to continue to grow, but you have to be careful about how you do
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   this.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   You can't just jump to the really heavy weight, but you also can't just stay on the weight
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.520]   that you're comfortable.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.220]   You have to systematically and incrementally increase that weight.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.840]   A year later, you're now much stronger and much more comfortable with much bigger weights
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.300]   than you were at the beginning.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.680]   So I want to argue that you should do something similar with discipline.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.160]   So I'm going to give you here an example ladder, and I'm going to walk you through the different
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.240]   levels of this ladder.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.680]   I recommend starting with a daily metric.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.360]   We've talked about this before on the show.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.520]   A daily metric is something you can check off every day, for example, in the metric
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.920]   tracking space if you use a time block planner, saying that you did this activity.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.920]   You start with a daily metric.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.840]   Now the key thing of a lot of these daily metric activities, especially when you're
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   getting started with a new pursuit, is that they can be very easy.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.020]   What you should be looking for when you're beginning on the discipline ladder is to find
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:12.040]   an activity that is not trivial, but still very comfortable in the array of what we would
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.200]   call the range of what we would call attractable.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.480]   These should be activities that don't require, for example, when you're first starting up
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   the discipline ladder, that shouldn't require that you schedule time in advance.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.280]   It's just something you want to get around to doing each day when you can find time.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.880]   So for the case of a case study, let's follow a sort of physical getting in better shape
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.180]   discipline ladder here.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:39.420]   The daily metric you might start with here could be doing 25 push-ups a day.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.380]   You don't got to put this on your calendar.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.340]   You don't got to make a big production about putting aside a lot of time.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.460]   It's just in the morning at lunchtime, "Oh, I didn't get to it.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.640]   Let me just knock this off real quick before I get ready for bed."
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.300]   You can find time to do this.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.060]   It's not trivial.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.620]   Trivial would be touch your toes once.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:02.580]   You're actually doing something that requires, you know, it's exercise and requires muscles,
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.340]   but it's tractable.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.860]   It doesn't require that much extra planning.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.860]   All right.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.060]   So you start with a daily metric when you're going up the discipline ladder.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.060]   You get used to that.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.060]   You check it off.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.060]   You do it every day.
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.060]   You see that you've done it.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.420]   And now you kind of feel, "Okay, I can sort of do regular work towards this general initiative.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.560]   I can do it regularly even if I don't want to.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.700]   This is important to me."
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.260]   The next step on the ladder, I would suggest, is a 15-minute project.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.180]   15 minutes.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.380]   It doesn't have to be every day.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.980]   It should be at least three days a week.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.700]   This requires a little scheduling.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.740]   15 minutes is enough time that you probably want to mark where you're going to do these
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.740]   15 minutes.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.820]   "Oh, before I go to work, right after the workday is over, I'm going to take extra time
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.820]   on my lunch break."
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.820]   Right?
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.420]   It's long enough that it requires a little bit of scheduling, but it's not that much
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.900]   time and you don't have to do that much during this actual period.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.620]   So returning to our case study here of getting in better shape, your 15-minute project might
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.940]   be you get one of these 10 or 15-minute, I'm going to say 10-minute because it takes time
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.300]   to get changed or whatever, do one of these 10-minute YouTube bodyweight workouts three
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.660]   or four times a week, maybe first thing in the morning or right after work.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.780]   I throw on my gym clothes at home, load it up on YouTube, "Hey, 10-minute bodyweight
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.780]   workout."
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.340]   I do these sometimes when we're on vacation, just want to keep moving.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.040]   You're like, "Yeah, it's push-ups, it's squats, it's sit-ups," or whatever.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.060]   This is not a huge ask, but now it's getting a little bit less trivial, right?
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.860]   It's an actual workout.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.420]   You don't have to muster massive motivation because it doesn't take a super long time,
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.380]   but now you actually are doing something on a semi-regular basis that in theory is getting
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.380]   you in better shape.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.380]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.680]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:56.020]   to check out my new book, "Slow Productivity, the Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:01.580]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.940]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.740]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.740]   Check it out.
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.740]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.740]   All right.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.740]   Once you're used to that, the next step on the discipline ladder is going to be what
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.900]   I call the 60-minute easy project.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:24.060]   Now you're putting aside, again, three plus times a week, a non-trivial block of time,
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.940]   somewhere between 45 to 90 minutes.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.020]   You definitely have to schedule this.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.020]   In fact, you probably want to autopilot schedule this, have this time on your calendar in advance.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.720]   Just these times, these days, this is when I do this.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.980]   But keep what you're doing during this time block easy.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.000]   All right.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.300]   Now you're getting used to putting aside the amount of time required to make serious progress
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.900]   on something, but you're keeping the actual work in this time block still pretty tractable
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:57.380]   because the difficulty you're getting used to here is putting aside the time.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.260]   That's what you're getting used to here.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260]   You don't want to compound that with the thing you're doing being really hard as well.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.580]   Going back to our workout case study, maybe now you're running a real workout program,
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:13.300]   not a hard one, but like an actual 30, 40-minute workout that you're doing three times a week.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.580]   It could be on YouTube.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.500]   When I was restarting my workout program back, this was back during COVID, I was using the
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.260]   Get Back Into It.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.980]   My wife's Peloton has workouts on it as well.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.420]   You're like, "Oh, I want to do a lower body workout.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.580]   I want it to be 20 minutes or 30 minutes."
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.580]   They're not too bad.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.580]   They're not that hard.
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.820]   It's not an intense split program.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.980]   It's not really pushing heavy weights.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.460]   I didn't have the impediment of like, "Oh my God, this is going to be brutal," but it
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.580]   just got me back up to speed with like, I put aside time to exercise as non-trivial
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.580]   time.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.580]   All right.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.780]   Then finally, the final step up the ladder is not increasing the time, but increasing
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.100]   the hardness of what you're doing in that time, 60-minute plus projects, successively
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.100]   harder.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.300]   Going to take that same time, but increase the intensity of what you're doing in there.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.220]   To our workout example, now you're going to maybe sub in an actual pretty like intense
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.860]   split workout.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:15.100]   Real weights, maybe doing at a gym now, really kind of trying to push to build muscles.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.700]   Or if it's a cardio-oriented thing, I'm really doing real interval training, really trying
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.100]   to actually increase my capacity here.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:29.100]   And then you can successively increase the hardness of what's in that 60-minute block.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.300]   That's an example discipline ladder.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.660]   You start with something really easy.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.580]   It's a check mark for something that takes three minutes, and you end up with like spending
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.260]   an hour plus three or four times a week doing something that's really hard.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.900]   If you jumped straight to this final step, and you're not used to doing these type of
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.060]   things, you might struggle.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.300]   But if you work your way up the ladder, you'll get there in about six months, and no particular
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.900]   step will seem all that hard.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.100]   Now here's the key part about the discipline ladder.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.900]   I think it's something that people get, they often get wrong.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.580]   The goal is this is not a technique for everything hard you want to do.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.380]   So the way you apply the discipline ladder is you don't say, okay, here's a new thing
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.380]   I want to do.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.340]   I'm going to ladder my way up to doing it at the full level of difficulty.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.700]   The discipline ladder is about practice with doing hard things.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:24.180]   So if you complete this ladder here for fitness that we just talked about, now when it comes
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.900]   time to do something unrelated, you can just jump in at a much harder level and be much
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.380]   more comfortable because you've gotten practice doing hard things.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:37.060]   The ladder is something you do to get used to doing hard things.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:42.260]   And then going forward, you're more comfortable jumping straight into hard things.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:47.720]   So you don't have to break up every hard thing you do into these multiple different steps.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.540]   This is something that you do once or twice to get your capacity increased.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.900]   Or if you've gone through a fallow period and you want to restart your energy for like
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.500]   a new year and I want to tackle hard things, do one ladder to get your comfort with the
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.960]   chemical obstacle, the focused activity, to get that comfort higher, to reduce those peaks.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.020]   And now you're ready to go on lots of different things.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.020]   All right.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.860]   So that's the discipline ladder.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.060]   One way among many to increase your discipline capacity.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.340]   So you basically probably did your ladder 20 years ago and now like your writing sessions
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.180]   are an example of hard things?
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.260]   I mean, and sometimes I'll do modified ladders just to sort of get back into it, just to
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.060]   sort of get my energy back into it.
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.620]   Sometimes if it's a really different domain, you might ladder.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.580]   Like I'm very used to writing and the discipline required for writing.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.420]   But when I was restarting my physical stuff, like during the pandemic, I felt like I had
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.860]   to ladder back up there.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.860]   It was kind of different enough.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.780]   I wanted to get more used to the physical domain.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.980]   So you could find yourself laddering to like re-energize yourself, or if there's like a
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:02.660]   brand new area that you're not used to acting in, the ladder can help you get used to that
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.540]   area in your life and doing hard things that area in your life.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.580]   And I think the physical intellectual is a kind of a classic split.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.420]   If you're not used to physical stuff, you got to get used to it, right?
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.060]   Or if you're a physical person who isn't used to doing intellectual stuff, you might have
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.540]   to run a new ladder over there.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.100]   There's an idea of modified ladders.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:26.580]   So even if you're used to doing something, if you have like a really hard endeavor to
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.740]   do a less hard version for a while, and then to take one step up to the full hard version,
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.740]   that's a good strategy as well.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:38.100]   You can kind of do that whenever you're like, okay, I'm taking on like a really big project.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.980]   Why don't I do an easier version of this for a few months just to get like my head space
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.540]   into this like type of work and to get the time put aside.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.180]   And then once I'm used to the time being put aside, let me increase the difficulty.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.100]   That I'll sometimes do, like get used to a schedule and then increase the intensity so
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.260]   I don't have to double up getting used to a new schedule and the increased intensity
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.260]   all at once.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.380]   So laddering in a lot of different ways could be useful, but the full ladder, yeah, you
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.220]   don't have to do that that often.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:13.460]   All right, we got some good discipline related questions coming up.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.380]   But first, let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.380]   Let's talk about our friends here at Cozy Earth.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.060]   Longtime listeners know I am a Cozy Earth fanatic.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:30.820]   My wife and I have a lot of Cozy Earth products because we love in particular their fabric,
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:37.540]   this sort of bamboo, premium viscose bamboo-based fabric we just love.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.540]   So we have the sheets.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.380]   We have multiple pairs of the sheets, we've told you this before, so that if one pair
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.500]   is being washed, we have another pair to be put on.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.580]   We have the towels.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.300]   My wife has the pajamas.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.580]   I have the sweatshirt.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.300]   We just put on last week the duvet cover made out of this same material.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.820]   So I'm just a big fan of Cozy Earth and the material.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:04.020]   I suggest start with the sheets if you want to get started with the Cozy Earth experience.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.260]   That will make you a believer.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.040]   It's just very comfortable.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.420]   It regulates the temperature.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.420]   It's not hot.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.620]   It's just we love the comfort of that fabric.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.300]   So I'm a big Cozy Earth believer.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.100]   If you want to become a Cozy Earth addict like me, start with the sheets and then you'll
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.980]   be Cozy Earthing everything in your life.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.880]   It just feels really good.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.160]   So wrap yourself in luxury this fall with Cozy Earth.

[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.740]   So that's CozyEarth.com/Deep and use that code "Deep."
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.860]   If you get a post-purchase survey, take a moment to say you heard about Cozy Earth from
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.900]   my podcast, Deep Questions with Cal Newport.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.260]   That makes a big difference for us here at the show.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:01.980]   Speaking of comfortable fabric, I also want to talk about our friends at Roan and in particular
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.780]   their commuter collection.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.000]   Here's the thing, men's closets were due for a radical reinvention and Roan stepped up
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.560]   to the challenge.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.360]   The Roan's commuter collection is the most comfortable, breathable and flexible set of
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.000]   products known to man.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.680]   And here's why.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.560]   They have a product for every occasion.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:24.280]   So the collection has pants, it has dress shirts, it has quarter zips, it has polos.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.960]   You never have to worry about what to wear when you have the commuter collection.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.720]   Their four-way stretch fabric is fantastic.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.420]   It's lightweight, it's flexible, it stretches and it's breathable.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.420]   You don't overheat.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.420]   This is what I love about it.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.620]   If I'm spending a day on campus giving meetings and speaking in panels or I'm going on a speaking
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.800]   event, I generate a lot of heat and I want lightweight, flexible fabric.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.020]   It has wrinkle release, which I love.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.100]   You can travel with this.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.380]   You put it on, the wrinkles disappear as you wear it so you don't have to worry about trying
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.380]   to iron your clothes.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.140]   You're going to look neat.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.060]   It even has Goldfusion anti-odor technology, so you'll be smelling fresh and clean all
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.240]   day long.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.820]   I'm a big fan of the commuter collection.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.220]   It is the right clothes if you want to look good, but you're getting after it and you
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.740]   want to be comfortable as well.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.580]   Now the commuter collection could get you through any workday and straight into whatever
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:23.220]   comes next and to rhone.com/cal and use the promo code CAL to save 20% off your entire
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.220]   order.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:33.820]   That's 20% off your entire order when you head to rhone.com/cal and use code CAL.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.880]   It's time to find your corner office comfort.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.740]   All right, Jesse, let's get some questions.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.140]   Who do we got first?
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.940]   First question's from Sully.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.720]   When I twinge of procrastination strikes, I distract myself away from the hard things
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.220]   I'm working on.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.020]   Sometimes I can fight off the urge by pausing and recognizing the urge, but often I lose
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.460]   and end up distracting myself with useless websites and other easier tasks instead of
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.180]   just doing the hard thing.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.020]   All right, well, this is a discipline question, right?
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.620]   I mean, this was our definition of discipline from the deep dive, the ability to do something
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:15.020]   hard that is important, but not like absolutely urgent, even when you don't want to do it
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.020]   in the moment.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.180]   All right, there's two things that helps with discipline, what we talked about today and
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.180]   what we talked about a few weeks ago in earlier episodes.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.420]   So the thing we talked about a few weeks ago, and I'll just remind you of this, is that
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.100]   it really helps if your mind has a plan it believes on for what you're trying to do and
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.140]   is on board about the potential rewards, right?
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.380]   Our mind is very good at simulating the future.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.240]   If it does not have a clear simulation about what you're trying to do and where it's going
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.020]   to lead you, a simulation at trust, it's less likely to generate a sense of motivation.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.860]   So if you're just coming at one of these hard things you're talking about here somewhat
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:56.820]   blindly, I don't know, let's just write, let's just like go to the gym with quotation marks
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.820]   and get in shape.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.500]   Your mind is going to say, wait, what's the plan here?
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.860]   I don't see a clear plan with which I have experience that's going to lead us likely
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.940]   to an outcome that I'm excited about.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.820]   You don't get motivation and those potential distractions are going to emerge as being
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.480]   much more appealing.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.460]   So you want to make sure, first of all, that you really understand what it is you're trying
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.120]   to do and how it is that people actually succeed at what you're trying to do.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.800]   Your mind has to trust your plan.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:26.740]   You also need to expose yourself constantly to the rewards at stake here so that your
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.820]   mind has a very vivid encoding of the rewards in your hippocampus.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.660]   That's going to play a big role when the planning system is trying to figure out whether or
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.740]   not it bestows to you motivation, right?
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.180]   Now the second thing that matters is what we just talked about in the deep dive.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.240]   Are you comfortable with this level of discipline?
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.040]   That is, is your mind comfortable with facing the chemical obstacle to focused activity
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.640]   that you're facing with this particular work?
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:59.900]   And if it's not, if that chemical obstacle is too large or it's too scary for you, try
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.900]   a discipline ladder.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.000]   Start on easier things and work your way up to get yourself more used to tackling things
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.440]   of that level of difficulty.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.760]   Discipline does practice and you might need to practice discipline a little bit more.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.440]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.080]   Next question is from Jess.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.600]   How can I pick daily metrics that really move my life values forward?
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.080]   I have a toddler, so implementing my daily metrics is tough.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.920]   The different routines of Ferris and Huberman, like looking at the sun in the first hour,
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:34.120]   five-minute journal, phone off for the first hour, cold plunge, they seem generic and not
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.120]   personal.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:42.780]   Well, look, keep in mind, caring for a toddler is just as difficult as any of the routines
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.120]   that Andrew Huberman does, right?
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.840]   There's just different routines for different people, different routines for different life
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.260]   circumstances.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.260]   And I agree with you.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.720]   You want to find the things that really matter for you, that are personal for you, that are
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.140]   important for the things that you value.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.280]   And it's perfectly fine if the things that really get you motivated are not the same
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.240]   things that get Andrew Huberman motivated.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.000]   All right, so let's think about it.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.240]   Daily metrics, let's define this for the audience first.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.520]   So I talk about this, that it's important that the things that are important to you,
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.920]   that you have something you do on them regularly.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.080]   When you're working on making your life deeper, I suggest keystone habits.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:30.280]   So these are daily metrics that are not hard, not trivial, but not tractable in the areas
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.960]   of your life that are important, just so that you signal to yourself that you're willing
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.920]   to do non-urgent things on different areas of your life that are important.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.260]   It's a good self-signaling mechanism.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:45.460]   And seeking these out, custom fit them to what matters to you in your life right now.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.620]   Reading a book every day to your toddler.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.380]   I definitely did this when my kids were babies, maybe toddler age as well.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.580]   Not long books, like we're talking Blue Truck, which, by the way, I could probably still
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:02.100]   recite word for word if I needed to right now.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:07.220]   I know more about Blue Truck than I know about almost any other topic.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.220]   That's a really good daily metric.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.140]   It's like, yeah, I want to read, it's a connection.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.900]   I want to just establish that I'm exposing my kid to words.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:19.900]   When you have young kids, you yourself reading a chapter of an interesting book about an
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.600]   idea that's interesting every day, that could be a very interesting daily metric, right?
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.220]   Because it's not about, oh, I want to finish a book every week.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:34.420]   It's I want to make sure that even amidst all these other pulls on my life, I'm still
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.500]   engaging in the world of ideas, even if it's minimal right now, right?
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.060]   Like, that could be a very meaningful daily metric.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.940]   Getting outside, being outside and running a gratitude exercise.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.940]   I used to do this a lot when my kids were young.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:47.940]   It would be with the kid.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.940]   I'd be pushing someone in a stroller or someone would be strapped on, like, you got to get
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.340]   outside and you got to go.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.620]   I had a particular gratitude exercise I would do where I would look into the future and
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.740]   think about some of the things that are hard right now with young kid childcare will be
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.100]   easier at this point in the future and I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.100]   And I want to do it outside.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.420]   I want to do it with sunlight.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.660]   And that was really important.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.480]   And that was a really important daily metric that I would do.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.600]   If you're working right now as well, outside of the home, you might want to have a really
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:22.380]   clear metric about, I'm tracking deep work hours to make sure that whatever windows of
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.460]   time I have in which I'm not involved in childcare.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:31.360]   So if my kid is at daycare or something like this and I have, here's my day when I can
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.180]   just be working at the office or at home and I'm not taking care of a kid, I want to make
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:39.220]   sure that I am getting in some protected hours and I'm insisting on that every day.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.780]   Even if it's small, it's again signaling to yourself, I'm not just an email answering
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:45.780]   machine.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.820]   I'm not just a meeting attending machine.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.220]   I'm a mind that can produce original value and I'm going to protect it even if it's just
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.380]   an hour a day and I'm going to mark it every day so I remember to do that.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.380]   So like what your daily metrics look like at this stage of life is going to be different
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.620]   than what it looked like 10 years ago.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.580]   I can tell you on the other end of it, all my kids are elementary, middle school age.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.640]   It'll look different then and it'll look very different than what Angie Huberman or Tim
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.700]   Ferriss care about and they're all fine.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.500]   Let me give you one extra hack to do, the sick day hack.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:22.020]   So if I'm sick, I write on my metric tracking space in my time block planner, SICK, capital
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.020]   letters.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.020]   I don't put any metrics down.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.720]   It's like, yeah, look, I'm sick.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.020]   I'm not going to care about doing the metrics.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.660]   Maybe I'll do some of them, but I'm not going to prioritize them.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.740]   You can have a couple outs like that, right?
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.580]   If you have young kids, you can have an out that just says chaos.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:45.660]   You don't want to be using this all the time, but it's like, oh my God, my kid's daycare
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:53.180]   is closed and I have to do these important meetings and there's a new deadline that popped
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.540]   up.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.620]   We're not worrying about our daily metrics, like making sure you do this, this, and this
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.620]   each day, reading this chapter, doing this, whatever.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:05.500]   I'm going to write chaos in my metric tracking space and just give myself permission to survive.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.540]   And that's absolutely fine.
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.420]   Now if you find yourself writing chaos again and again and again, week after week, month
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.220]   after month, that's a useful signal that your life is too chaotic.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.820]   It's not sustainable what you're doing, but I think it's like a great way of not feeling
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.260]   guilty about, I can't do this every time.
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.940]   Some days just get away from me.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.900]   It's a way of just declaring metric bankruptcy for that day.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   It's like, it's okay.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:29.900]   I'll be back at it tomorrow.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:30.900]   All right.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.780]   So Jesse, I think you're doing great.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:38.660]   Make the metrics work for you or alternatively bring that toddler into the cold plunge with
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.340]   you because it's never too early to get hard.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.820]   Gotta get hard, like David Goggin says.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.820]   So there we go.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.820]   All right.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.820]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.500]   Next question's from Virtue.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.860]   I can work consistently and disciplined without relying on external motivations towards a
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.860]   goal.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.740]   If something negative happens, like a rejection, my discipline starts to break down and I begin
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.060]   to focus more on the negative.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.140]   In this situation, what would you recommend I do to get back to my routines?
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.780]   That's a great question.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.260]   And it's something I've thought a lot about.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.980]   I mean, I face this a lot in my own life.
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.620]   I would say that the period of my life where I really began facing this consistently for
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:21.180]   the first time, where I actually had to think about systematically how do I deal with a
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.820]   focused effort leading to a bad outcome.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.420]   The time when I first started systematically thinking about this was actually as a graduate
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   student.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.080]   And the event would be papers being rejected.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.600]   I need to publish papers, right, to get a job.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.180]   I thought this was a good paper.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.040]   It got rejected.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.280]   Because in the life of a computer scientist, a theoretical computer scientist, you submit
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.060]   a lot of papers to its conferences and they're incredibly competitive and they have low acceptance
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:50.140]   rates, 20%, 15% acceptance rates, and you're trying to be good enough to get accepted.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.340]   So I developed some ideas and I want to share some of these ideas with you as well.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.460]   If it's a serious negative event, and I'm assuming right now we're talking about something
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:04.740]   big enough to really throw you for a loop, not someone said something mean to you in
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:10.180]   passing, but like a real rejection or a failure of a project or not getting a promotion or
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:17.260]   not getting a job, right, more major things, it's OK to give it a day or so to fester.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.100]   Don't immediately pretend like it doesn't exist.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:28.540]   Be upset, commiserate, talk to friends or family, you know, you have a drink that night.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.700]   That's OK.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.100]   Like lean into the emotion a little bit.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:36.940]   Like I really wanted this to go well and it didn't.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.940]   And I'm kind of upset and worried that it didn't.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:45.580]   Part of the advantage of doing this, especially around other people, is that it removes or
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.340]   reduces the ego defense, right?
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.180]   You might have this initial reaction of like, man, this looks negative for me and I want
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.620]   to kind of try to hide this and I want to try to convince everyone that I'm perfect
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.500]   and I only ever succeed.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.540]   If you start commiserating, it's like a relief.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.420]   You've taken down the ego defense like, OK, I can just admit like this.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.980]   I wanted this to go well and it didn't.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.540]   And I'm embarrassed it didn't go well.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.620]   It takes that ego wall out of there and this is going to make it much easier for you to
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.820]   actually move on.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.220]   You're going to be much less defensive about the whole situation.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.500]   So take a day or two and let it fester.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.740]   Next you need to figure out a plan for what comes next.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:25.380]   This means you're going to have to do somewhat of a postmortem.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.380]   What went wrong here?
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.900]   And it's got to be an honest postmortem.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.380]   You really want the real answer and this might mean actually talking, getting an unvarnished
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.940]   opinion from someone else, talking to someone else.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.220]   Why do you think I didn't get this or why was this paper rejected, right?
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.420]   Or it's just an honest self-assessment.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:45.140]   Like, let's say you had a big exam and you did really poor on it, right?
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.060]   You want to go back and say, what went wrong here?
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.620]   Like, how did I prepare for this?
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.620]   What worked?
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.620]   What didn't?
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.700]   What did I do too much of?
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.060]   What did I not do enough of, right?
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.180]   So you really want to understand what went wrong and then make decisions.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.460]   Is there an adjustment needed?
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.080]   And sometimes the answer will be yes, right?
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:10.200]   If it's like a test you did really bad on and you do a postmortem, you'll probably figure
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.900]   out, oh, there was a much better way I should have studied for this.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.580]   So going forward, this is how I'm going to study for future tests like this.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.900]   I learned from that failure.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:24.220]   Or if it was an academic paper that got rejected, you're like, okay, the quality is just not
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.220]   there.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.220]   I need more results.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.980]   The results have to be harder.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.180]   Whatever it is, you're figuring out, okay, I know what I need, right?
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.180]   I know what I need to succeed at this the next time.
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.780]   Sometimes, however, it might be there's nothing you did.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.780]   It's just the way it works.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.180]   It's like, hey, I'm doing something competitive.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.180]   Sometimes it's going to work.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.180]   Sometimes it's not.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.180]   I threw my hat in the ring.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.380]   It didn't work out.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.060]   It was a long shot anyways.
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.240]   There's nothing really to change.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   It just depends.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.940]   But you want to figure out what went wrong, what adjustments need to be made, what's your
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.820]   plan going forward?
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.380]   Am I going to try again in this thing?
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.940]   Am I going to try to fix this paper?
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.460]   Am I going to overhaul the way I do my work?
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.980]   Am I going to take a corner of career capital and I'm really going to try to amplify it
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.460]   very systematically?
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.060]   Make a plan going forward based on what you learned.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.060]   Write that plan down.
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.380]   Make sure it's in whatever systems you use.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.460]   And now you were done thinking about the failure.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:28.080]   You festered, you analyzed, you adjusted, you made a plan, now you move on.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.280]   If you find yourself having a hard time not snapping your attention back, which will happen
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.820]   especially if the thing was public or embarrassing.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.180]   If you have a hard time not preventing your attention from continually snapping back to
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:48.500]   ruminating on the failure, you're going to deploy a modified version of cognitive behavioral
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.580]   therapy.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:56.300]   You'll have a brief session in the morning before work and at the end of the workday
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:02.720]   where you will confront the rumination, the thinking about the thing that went wrong.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:08.700]   You will point out where in that thinking there is distortions, like, "Okay, here is
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.540]   the negative thought I'm coming back to.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.380]   Here are the distortions in that thinking."
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.900]   And you can just Google cognitive behavioral therapy distortions and you'll see a whole
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:17.900]   list.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.900]   And they have names.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.900]   You want to use the name when you're doing this.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.140]   It's black and white thinking.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.260]   It's predicting the future.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.740]   It's catastrophizing.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.340]   You point out, "Here's the thought that's really bothering me.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.340]   Here are the distortions.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.780]   Here are their names.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.540]   I have a plan for how to deal with this.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.420]   I trust my plan.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.660]   And now I will shut down confronting this rumination until the next session, the end
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.740]   of the workday or the next morning."
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.740]   When the thoughts come up again, you say, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.580]   I did a CBT session on this this morning.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.580]   I have one coming up in a few hours.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.260]   I'll get back to you, brain, when we get to that next session."
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.140]   And you consolidate your rumination to a couple times a day.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.580]   During that time, you systematically point out distortions and confirm to yourself you
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.500]   have a plan.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.280]   This works.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.940]   Do this for a few days.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.540]   If it's a really bad event, do it for a couple weeks.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.340]   The urge to ruminate will dissipate.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.380]   You'll be executing your plan, and you'll move on.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.200]   What's important is you can't just ignore rejection.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.340]   The negative feelings that rejection or a negative event create, they're real.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.740]   If you pretend like they don't exist, your mind's not going to believe you because you're
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.740]   wrong.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.740]   They matter.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.780]   You need to do something with it.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:30.660]   But if you give yourself some time to revel in it, to fester, and really make a good plan
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.320]   going forward, your mind will then be ready to move on.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.620]   Okay, we do have a plan.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.620]   We got into this.
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.620]   What's next?
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.120]   And you can use CBT to help yourself get there a little bit quicker.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.320]   I do that all the time with various things I face.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.120]   It works like a charm.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.200]   All right, what do we got?
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.500]   Next question is from Anonymous.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:56.360]   You often talk about how you allocate a half day per week to your podcast.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.840]   I'm in a similar situation with my own part-time project.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.320]   I can't seem to find the discipline to consistently find time to work on it every week.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.520]   In weeks that you have lots going on, how do you still find time to fit in that half
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.520]   day per week?
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:14.040]   Well, I mean, I think your answer is you just got to get Jesse to show up, right?
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.480]   I got to come do this because Jesse's going to be here, and he would be here all alone,
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.000]   and that makes me sad.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.720]   So then that motivates me, like, okay, I guess I got to come do this podcast.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:31.200]   If I don't, we're going to find Jesse here in a long conversation with Jesse Skeleton,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.800]   just trying to stave off the loneliness, the boredom of being here all by myself.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:41.160]   All right, no, seriously, okay, you want to put regular work in on something.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.440]   Logistically speaking, have a set time put on your calendar.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.600]   Treat it like any other appointment.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.320]   So it's a big deal for you not to do it.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:54.040]   Like, if you have an appointment on your calendar, dentist, and you don't go, that's a big deal.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.840]   You're saying, I am choosing not to do, I'm choosing to reject this appointment.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.120]   So do that.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:04.600]   Schedule regular time so that if you're just trying to figure out, like, when do I want
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.600]   to do it this week?
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   How do I feel?
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   Do I want to do it now?
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.900]   If you're giving yourself a choice, it's easier for your mind to talk yourself out of it.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.000]   So that's step one.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.520]   Step two, make sure what you're doing makes sense, like your mind is on board.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.840]   It's easy to jump into the big, I want to put a lot of time aside.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.560]   Let's just get into this.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.560]   I want to be a writer.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.240]   So let's put aside, let's write all day Friday.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.600]   But if you don't know what that means, your mind doesn't trust you have a plan to become
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.600]   a successful writer.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.560]   It knows you don't know very much about it.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.480]   It knows you don't even know what you're going to do on those days.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.000]   You just want to put your earthenware coffee cup and Instagram it and write in your bullet
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.520]   journal or whatever.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.440]   If it knows you don't really have a good plan, it's like, come on, buddy, what are we doing
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.680]   here?
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.480]   So make sure you know, like, the time you're putting aside is serving a plan that you understand
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   and trust.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.600]   Don't start with the time and then say, if I put aside this time, this will somehow induce
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   me to make progress.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.880]   Your mind's not going to buy that plan.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.600]   And then three, you might need to ladder up.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:09.100]   So go back to the discipline ladder that we talked about during the deep dive.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:15.620]   If you're going from zero to five hours a week on some big ambition, your mind might
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.380]   be like, I'm not used to doing something so hard that's optional and urgent, and this
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.140]   is weird, and it feels indulgent, and let's not do it.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.140]   So you might need to be laddering here, right?
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.860]   You might need to be starting with, every day I'm doing a little thing relevant to this
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.860]   project.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.120]   And then I move up to, like, the 15-minute projects.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.700]   And then at 60 minutes, three times a week, I start with, like, an easy thing, then a
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.700]   harder thing.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:43.420]   So now this thing, this type of work I'm not used to doing, optional side hustle work,
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.980]   is now something I'm doing regular time on, and the effort I'm giving to it's very hard.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.820]   I'm very comfortable with the chemical obstacles to focused activity now in this particular
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.420]   type of pursuit.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.380]   Now I think I'm ready to consolidate this on, like, Friday mornings.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:03.120]   So you might also need to ladder up if your mind is not used to giving really serious
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.220]   attention to something that is, like, not part of your job or something that someone
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.500]   is demanding that you actually do.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.500]   Or you just hire Jesse.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.860]   Jesse, you're available for, like, anyone who wants you just to come to their house,
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.860]   just so they'll be motivated.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.100]   Just drive my truck there.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.340]   Just drive your truck there.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.340]   You'll hear him coming.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.340]   All right.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.460]   Oh, we got a Slow Productivity Corner question?
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.460]   Yes, we do.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.460]   All right.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.700]   For those who aren't familiar, every week we like to do one question that's relevant
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.300]   to my new book, "Slow Productivity, the Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.020]   About half of what we talk about on the show is directly or indirectly related to this
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.020]   book.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.100]   So if you haven't bought it yet, you need to.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.380]   It's like the Bible for the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:45.820]   But the real reason we do the Slow Productivity Corner question is so we can hear the segment
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.820]   theme music.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:51.060]   Let's hear that music, Jesse.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:55.100]   All right.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.100]   What's our question today?
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.100]   All right.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.460]   Today's question is from JR.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.940]   How can an organization adopt slow productivity principles?
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.140]   For example, how can an academic department or college do fewer things, work at a natural
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.500]   pace, and obsess over quality?
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.780]   There's often a fixed number of non-negotiable projects, service, teaching, with set deadlines
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:19.740]   that detract from deep work in other areas, like research.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:26.180]   So the reality about projects and obligations in most workplaces is that there are vastly
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:32.700]   more things that you could be doing than there is time to do them.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.580]   We often tell ourselves a story.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:41.020]   The story we tell ourselves is there's some ideal set of things that people want us to
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.260]   do or that we want to do.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:50.620]   And if we can just accomplish this collection, then we're doing our job and be successful.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.460]   And if we don't do everything in this collection, we're not going to do our job or be successful.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:41:00.420]   And so in this way, we imagine we feel very bad saying no to things you're trying to reduce
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.500]   because these are the things that need to be done.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.700]   But the reality is, no, no, there's not some set of things that you need to do to be successful.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.320]   There is a massive collection of things from which you are actually, whether you know it
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.820]   or not, sampling what can actually fit into your schedule.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.540]   And so what people do, they're implicitly saying no all the time, because again, there's
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.540]   way more stuff than you could be doing.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:24.660]   So what people do is they basically bring things into their professional life until
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:30.520]   they get sufficiently stressed that they have psychological cover to start saying no.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.300]   But here's the thing, the difference between having enough stuff that it makes you stressed
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:40.140]   and pulling that back 20% so that you're not so stressed by the overhead of all you have
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.500]   to do, to the outside world, that difference is very small.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.340]   No one knows the difference.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:49.620]   But to your psychological reality, it makes a huge difference.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.060]   So our workloads are arbitrary.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.060]   That's what I want to say.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.420]   Our workloads are arbitrary.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.100]   We do 20% too much just because it's our heuristic for how we manage our load.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.360]   When I'm stressed, I'll start saying no.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.540]   This holds for professors as well.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.740]   Yes, there are things you need to do.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:02.740]   You have to teach your classes.
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.380]   You have to work on your research.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.620]   That does not take up all your time.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:12.100]   The amount of service you take on, that is highly malleable.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:17.220]   The amount of overhead you take on surrounding your research and your classes is often also
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.280]   highly malleable.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.940]   Most professors, contrary to the article we're going to read in the third segment, just kind
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.740]   of pile this stuff on until they're stressed and they start saying no.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:32.820]   So what would an academic institution do, for example, to make workloads more reasonable?
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.980]   Here are some very specific ideas.
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.340]   I think there should be service budgets.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:42.680]   Here's how many hours you can spend maximum working on service as a professor of a given
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.920]   rank at our university.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.680]   We track it, and you can't go above it.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.000]   So yeah, there's more service than you could possibly ever fit into your day.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.180]   So we might as well be clear about how much you should do instead of it being 20% too
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.180]   much.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.180]   Let's make it a reasonable number.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.740]   I think universities should have service days.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:03.580]   This day of the week, and in particular, this half of this day of the week is when all meetings
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.820]   and calls, et cetera, related to service happen.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.220]   It's got to fit in there.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.420]   It doesn't just happen randomly throughout the week.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.740]   This is when this stuff happens.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.540]   Service should be something you're working on like one day a week, and only maybe half
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.620]   of that day actually gets used up by calls.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:22.380]   The university would still function if you did this, but we don't.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.900]   I think individuals in the university setting should have quotas for important but unbounded
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.580]   request types, stuff they need to do, but there's an unbounded number of requests coming
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:30.580]   in.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:31.580]   You need strict quotas.
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.020]   Here's how many peer reviews I do per semester.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:38.500]   Here's how many non-departmental committees I sit on.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:44.600]   If I'm being a journal area editor, here's what I take off of my plate to compensate.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.940]   So it's not about not doing things.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:51.100]   It's about having a reasonable quota for the number of important things that you do.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.180]   I want to do reviews.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.460]   I want to sit on committees.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:58.500]   I want to take my turn as a journal editor, but I don't want to do too many reviews.
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.060]   I don't want to be on too many committees.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.100]   I don't want to be an editor while I'm trying to do three other major things.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.140]   So quotas, I think, make a really big difference.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:11.020]   I also think academic institutions could do a good job of putting in more administrative
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.020]   support.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:16.340]   We'll get into this more in the final segment.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:21.740]   Universities are happy to bring in more administrators, but they don't invest as much in administrative
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.740]   support.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:28.320]   So everything you take on your plate brings with it overhead, administrative overhead.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.740]   It is the increase of that overhead past a certain point that makes work very unsustainable
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.740]   and stressful.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:39.100]   So if you can reduce the overhead that comes with obligations, you increase the sustainability
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.540]   of professors' workloads.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:48.140]   In general, if we move beyond academia, the thing organizations should care about is the
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.900]   ratio of administrative overhead to actual execution.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:59.240]   Time spent supporting work, emails, meetings, discussions, versus time spent actually doing
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.380]   the work that has a clear value for the organization.
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:09.820]   If the ratio of overhead to work gets too high, your employees become much less useful.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.820]   They also burn out.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.980]   They also get exhausted.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:13.980]   It is not the case.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.740]   This is not a linear dose function.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.940]   You cannot just keep increasing the amount of things you ask people to do and have an
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.860]   increase in the amount of work that they produce.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.100]   It's a nonlinear equation.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.060]   What actually happens here is that—think of it as like, if we're going to be nerdy,
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.140]   it's probably more like a quadratic shape going on here.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.580]   As you get past a certain amount of work, the ratio of overhead to work gets high enough
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:39.420]   that there's not enough time left to actually make consistent progress on work, and the
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.060]   amount of work accomplished starts to go back down.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:48.340]   So this is how institutions more generally can support slow productivity, is recognizing
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.420]   this reality.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.260]   You cannot just endlessly give more work to people.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.940]   It does not give you more and more actual work done.
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.980]   There's a sweet spot of overhead to execution in that ratio, and to hit that sweet spot,
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.900]   you got to be explicit about workload management.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:08.920]   So I just don't like this idea that we're like, "Look, this is somehow like the happiness
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.460]   of employees versus work getting done."
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.460]   No, no.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.300]   This is about, "Is work getting done or not?"
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.500]   You put too much work on people's plates, less gets done.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.020]   So I think the slow productivity principles are not just possible in organizations, they're
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.620]   imperative if you want to do better as an organization, be it academic or otherwise.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:32.300]   All right, I feel like, Jesse, that means we should get a little bit more theme music.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:41.220]   All right, do we have a call this week?
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.220]   We do.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.220]   All right.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.220]   We'll hear it.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   Okay.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   Hi, Cal.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.580]   This is Jonathan from Winnipeg.
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:54.580]   You talk a lot about process-centered emails, and it's all great, I love it.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.660]   But here's the problem.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.660]   Nobody reads their email.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.580]   I've been sending these emails.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:06.580]   I send long, detailed, very specific, very precise emails.
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:10.980]   Not necessarily overlong, but it's got the information that people need.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.340]   But they don't read them, Cal, they don't read them.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   What am I going to do?
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.820]   What do I do about this?
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:21.260]   Oh, yeah, it's a real problem, especially, I'll tell you this.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:26.820]   That problem has gotten worse since I first introduced the idea of process-centric emails
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.140]   in my book, Deep Work.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:33.300]   All right, so for the listener who doesn't know what we're talking about here, a process-centric
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:39.380]   email is a method for reducing the number of unscheduled back-and-forth messaging required
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.900]   to accomplish a project or objective, right?
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.100]   So the default way people get things done in the knowledge work context is we just sort
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:50.020]   of shoot emails back and forth or Slack messages, and we kind of figure it out on the fly.
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:55.940]   This is a problem, because if completing an objective requires that we get through an
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:01.260]   unscheduled back-and-forth interaction, I have to parry those messages back to you pretty
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.260]   quickly, right?
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.100]   Like, if we're going to figure this out, it's going to take 10 back-and-forth messages,
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:09.860]   and we're going to figure it out today, I got to see your next message probably within
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.540]   like 10 or 15 minutes of it arriving, just so that we have time for this conversation
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.540]   to play out.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:20.380]   Now, the problem with this is if I have to see your message within the next 10 or 15
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.340]   minutes, I have to keep checking my inbox.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:27.660]   This is where the bulk of chronic inbox checking comes from.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:32.380]   Not a failure of will or bad productivity habits, but because we have these ongoing
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.320]   unscheduled conversations we have to service.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:40.380]   So with process-centric emailing, what you do is when you initiate via email one of these
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:46.940]   projects, we need to work on this together, you describe in your first email the process
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:51.200]   by which you're going to collaborate on this project to get it done, and the process you
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.780]   describe should hopefully prevent for you to have to use unscheduled messaging.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.460]   So like the classic example here is where you say like, "Okay, here's what we're going
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.460]   to do.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.820]   We got to get this report back to the client by Thursday," and you lay out the process.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:09.140]   You say, "Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk to the team during our status
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:14.180]   meeting today, and then I'll edit this document, and I will put my edits into this shared folder
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.700]   by the end of business today.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.660]   Please look at it at some point tomorrow.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:24.920]   I'm going to take it back, annotate it with any questions, make any edits you want.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:30.620]   I have that done by 3 o'clock tomorrow and put the new version in the shared folder.
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:37.480]   I'm going to pick it up and do a final edit and send it to the designer tomorrow afternoon.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.920]   The designer will have this done by noon the next day.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.540]   Any final comments have to me by like 3 o'clock.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:50.860]   You just annotate the document, and I'll do the final submittal that afternoon."
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:55.220]   That's a process-centric email because you've described using shared locations and time
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.980]   deadlines how the collaboration is going to happen.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.440]   No more emails need to be sent.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.140]   This project will now get executed without you having to receive a single unscheduled
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.900]   message and reply to it.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.940]   The caller is pointing out correctly that increasingly people don't read those emails.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:17.580]   They don't read those emails because this hyperactive hive mind, we're constantly communicating
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:24.180]   mode of work has gotten worse since 2016 when I first published that book.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.020]   We have a lot more slack than we had back then.
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.020]   Slack wasn't even around.
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:32.040]   I think I talked about in Deep Work, and we'll have to check this, Jesse, but I think the
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.260]   instant messenger service I talked about was HipChat.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:39.140]   I don't know if you remember HipChat, but like, yeah, it was like one of the early instant
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.140]   messengers.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.020]   It was mainly used among developers.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.020]   Okay.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   It was even before Slack.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:49.820]   We're so hyperactive now that, yeah, people don't even read the emails because they have
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:57.740]   so much messaging that now it's like they are being bombarded, and you're just trying
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.540]   to knock these things back as quick as possible.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:08.420]   You're just typing as fast as you can type to get a message temporarily off of your plate.
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.300]   Me like talk soon singe, right?
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.300]   It's like just caveman emailing, just trying to get things off your plate as quickly as
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.300]   possible.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.300]   No one's reading them.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:17.300]   So it is a problem.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:22.900]   The solution is to walk through the process real-time, right?
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.380]   I think that tends to work better.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.340]   Let me just talk to you about how we should do this.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.260]   And when you're talking to someone real-time, they actually have to listen.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.260]   They're going to hear it.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   So if you're at the office, grab them in the hallway.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.340]   Grab them in their office.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.460]   Grab them at the end of a meeting.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.780]   Hey, let me just talk to you for five minutes.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:48.380]   You can do, if your relative ranks make this possible, you could just tell them in your
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.700]   response to the email like, yeah, let's make a plan for this.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.980]   I have some ideas.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.380]   Stop by my next office hours when you can.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:56.380]   Do you have office hours?
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:01.020]   Or if you don't, just say, yeah, give me a call when you can, and we'll walk through
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.020]   a process for this.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:06.980]   You probably just have to move the process description to synchronous.
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:09.420]   It has to be real-time conversation.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.340]   And then they'll get on board with it.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:16.500]   Hidden benefit, 50% of the things will disappear because people don't want to do that little
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.300]   bit of friction.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.580]   It's not an urgent project, but they want to get it out of their inbox like, we do this
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.580]   good, right?
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.300]   Question mark, emoji, send, right?
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.300]   Just trying to get it off their plate.
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.300]   Like, yeah, we should do this.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.540]   Like, technically, I've made progress on this.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.740]   And when they get called back with an actual friction point, like, oh, I have to actually
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:37.460]   call this person or stop by their office at some point and talk about this, you're like,
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:38.460]   you know what?
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.340]   I like option B, which is we don't really need to do this.
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:45.140]   So 50% of your projects will go away.
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.820]   My old department chair was really good at this.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:47.820]   He'd say, call me.
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:48.820]   We'll talk about it.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.620]   And he would filter out.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.900]   That would filter out a lot of things.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:57.700]   I think his other trick, which I really liked, was like, if you just blurted out a complaint
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:03.420]   at a faculty meeting, just like, this is terrible, faculty meeting stuff, he'd be like, yeah,
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.140]   we have a very simple process.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.540]   We're happy to talk about any topic.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.420]   You just have to submit it in writing two weeks before the next faculty meeting.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.860]   I'll disseminate it for comment, and then we'll put it on the agenda for the faculty
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.860]   meeting.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:19.860]   95% of things that people are complaining about, they're not going to do that for.
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.860]   And it really cut down.
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:26.180]   So give people a little bit of friction, and you'll be surprised by.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.180]   You can reverse this.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:32.020]   So if they're at a higher rank, offer to do more work.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:40.620]   It's like, yeah, I think we should talk this through briefly, how best to do it.
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.300]   Let me know when I can call you or stop by your office, and I'll come find you and figure
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.060]   this out.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.820]   That'll work as well.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.580]   You're working the relative ranks well.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.580]   You're not trying to give work.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.700]   You're actually saying, I'm willing to do work on your behalf.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.700]   I will come find you.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.860]   I will call you.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.660]   Bosses are so busy that, again, like five times out of 10, they'll just not respond
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.660]   to that and the thing's off your plate.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.660]   Friction's great.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.660]   All right.
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.020]   I believe we have a case study here.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.260]   This is where people write in with examples of putting the type of things we talk about
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.140]   on this show in the action in their own life.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:14.500]   Good way to see what this advice looks like in the wild.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:18.220]   Today's case study comes from Mike.
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:23.660]   Mike says, "Recently, I leveraged my career capital completely by accident.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.500]   I was a freelancer at a small professional services firm working in a role I already
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.620]   had 10 years of experience in.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.540]   Things were going great until they were purchased by a large conglomerate.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:36.900]   The new conglomerate offered to keep me as a freelancer on the condition that I transition
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.340]   to a different role.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:42.620]   I gave the new role a good try for six months, but I just couldn't get the hang of it.
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:48.060]   Plus, I was wanting to take a break from work altogether to focus on some personal things.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.780]   My spouse and I both have aging parents.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.860]   We have a ton of renovations we need to do to our house.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.180]   My plan was to take a year off work to focus on those things and then come back and find
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.660]   work in my original specialization.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:02.260]   So I put in my notice, but I was surprised by the reaction.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:06.300]   They said they loved my work in the original position, and if I was willing, they would
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.400]   switch me back to that.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.780]   They knew I wanted to focus on my personal life, but they still didn't want to lose me
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:12.780]   altogether.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:18.100]   So they offered to increase my hourly rate and let me focus only on projects I specialized
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.380]   in, all on a part-time basis.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:24.380]   I didn't ask for this flexibility, but they recognized my career capital better than I
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:25.380]   did.
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:29.420]   As a result, I now work three days a week in the role I specialize in, and I have nothing
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.500]   to do with a task that I was bad at.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.780]   I make almost as much money as I previously did.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:38.300]   I use my extra time to take care of my parents and my spouse's parents, work on house repairs,
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:41.580]   and I've even joined an adult sports league.
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:45.380]   From time to time, I have taken on an extra short-term consulting client for some extra
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.240]   money if it fits my schedule.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.720]   My life is deeper.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.380]   My work hours are spent where I provide the most value, and I have more non-work hours
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.780]   devoted to things that are important for my marriage and family.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.620]   My only regret is not taking the lessons of career capital sooner."
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:04.780]   Mike, that's a great case study.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:09.980]   Here's the thing about career capital, which is our term for your rare and valuable skills,
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.700]   the main leverage you have for shaping your career.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:18.260]   One of the most important types of career capital you can build is just be someone who
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.780]   is reliable and gets things done.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:26.100]   That's why I tell young people all the time, I know it's not sexy, but the thing you need
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:31.260]   to care about, especially early in your job, is you're organized, you do the things you're
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:35.380]   going to do, you say you're going to do, and you get them done on time.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:40.220]   Everything falls through the cracks, and you do work at a reasonable level of quality.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:43.340]   Okay, there's an issue here, I'm going to solve this issue.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:47.420]   If people trust you're going to do work, you're going to get it done on time, you're not going
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:53.460]   to be a problem, and the work's going to be good quality, you don't have to be a superstar.
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:54.820]   That is incredibly valuable.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:55.820]   Now here's the thing.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:01.900]   From the employer perspective, they are desperate to find people who meet those traits.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.900]   They're reliable.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:03.900]   They get things done.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:04.900]   They do it well.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:10.580]   They're desperate for people like that, and they do not want to see people like that go.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:14.020]   It is the easiest, most powerful type of career capital that you can build.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:18.460]   So yeah, sometimes when we talk about career capital, we kind of get into the exciting
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:22.900]   territory of you're deliberately practicing some sort of 10x skill that makes you such
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.740]   a superstar that you can just say, "I'm going to work from a boat, and I'm going to work
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:31.340]   one day a week, three weeks a year, and you're going to pay me a million dollars."
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.700]   It's like the exciting scenarios of becoming like the superstar.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.620]   You don't have to become a superstar like Mike showed.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:41.240]   To gain the leverage needed to craft a really deep life.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.240]   He was good at what he did.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.240]   He did it well.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.240]   He was reliable.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.240]   He was dependable.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.380]   His employer's like, "We don't want you to go, and when you're in that situation, you
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.300]   can craft really interesting things."
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.420]   From their point of view, him working three days a week versus five, it's fine.
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.100]   It's all pretty similar to them, but for Mike, it makes a really big difference, so I like
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.100]   it.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.700]   That's a great example of career capital in action.
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:05.500]   You don't have to become LeBron James.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.940]   If you're someone who can just consistently guard against a jump start and get a good
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.420]   number of boards per game, team's happy to keep you on the floor.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:16.620]   How'd my basketball analogy go there, Jesse?
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:17.620]   Not bad.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.620]   Not bad?
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.460]   I was kind of stretching there.
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:24.700]   Yesterday, LeBron and his son played in a preseason game together.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.700]   Oh, yeah?
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.820]   Okay, here's a naive question.
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:31.140]   Does LeBron's son play professional basketball?
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.140]   Who is he?
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:36.140]   He was drafted by the Lakers, but there he is.
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.820]   Was he the same age as his dad when he got drafted?
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:38.820]   I remember his dad got drafted.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.100]   No, he's a little bit older, but there was a little bit of...
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.580]   Did he play college ball?
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:43.580]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.580]   Okay.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.860]   Was he one of the best players in college basketball?
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.860]   No.
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:50.900]   I mean, LeBron got drafted at 16, out of high school, right?
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:51.900]   Right, out of high school, yeah.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.740]   See, I know a lot about basketball.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.780]   If anybody has any case studies, they can email me at jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:02.220]   Yes, we love them, so jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:03.220]   Send them in.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.260]   All right, we got a cool final segment here.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:10.620]   I'm going to put myself on trial, but first, let's hear from another sponsor.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:15.940]   Going online without ExpressVPN is like driving a car without car insurance.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:20.220]   You might be a great driver, and a lot of times, you'll get away with it, but there's
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.660]   a lot of crazy people on the road these days.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:26.920]   It's eventually going to catch up with you, so why take that risk?
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.420]   That's what it's like going online without a VPN.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:31.980]   All right, so here's the issue.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:37.180]   When you connect to the internet, you might think you're safe because you're using a quote
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:39.380]   unquote encrypted connection.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.820]   The nerds know this as the SSL protocol.
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:46.460]   The problem is that just encrypts the body of your packet, but the header, which says
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:52.500]   who you are and who you're talking to, that remains plain, open to the public.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:56.980]   So if I'm sitting next to you at a coffee shop, I could have a special radio card.
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:59.460]   I could see exactly what sites and services you're using.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:03.700]   If I'm your internet service provider at home, your home internet service provider, I can
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.780]   see exactly what sites and services you're using, and I can collect that information.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.900]   I can sell that information, and they do that.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:13.500]   When you use a VPN, you get rid of the ability to snoop on you in that way, because with
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:18.420]   a VPN, you take the site or service you want to talk to, you take the message, you encrypt
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:23.060]   the whole message, and you send it to a VPN server.
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:26.540]   So all the person sniffing your packets or the internet service provider sees is that
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.860]   you're talking to a VPN server.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.740]   That's all they learn.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:32.820]   Then the VPN server unencrypts your original message and talks to the site and service
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.580]   on your behalf, encrypts the response, and sends it back.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:42.580]   You now have complete privacy about what you are doing online, all right?
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.100]   So you need a VPN.
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:49.160]   If you're going to use a VPN, I suggest ExpressVPN.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.180]   The encryption they use is super secure.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:55.420]   The number of bits that they're using in their encryption configuration would require a supercomputer
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.060]   over a billion years to crack.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.860]   So it's not going to be broken into.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:00.860]   It's very easy to use.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:05.140]   It's one of the things I like best about ExpressVPN is press a button on whatever device you're
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.780]   using that you've set this up on.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.980]   And now all the internet stuff you do is protected.
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:14.220]   Use your apps, use your browser, you don't even know it, it's all transparent.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.620]   Your phone, your laptop, your tablet, it'll work.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:21.300]   ExpressVPN is rated number one by top tech reviewers like CNET and The Verge.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.900]   All right, so you need a VPN, you're going to use a VPN.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.560]   I recommend using ExpressVPN.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.300]   Secure your online data today by visiting ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:37.060]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S VPN.com/deep.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.220]   You can get an extra three months free, but only when you go to ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:48.540]   I also want to talk about our friends at MyBodyTutor.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:53.460]   I've known Adam Gilbert, MyBodyTutor's founder for many years.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:58.900]   He used to be the fitness advice calmness for my blog back in the early days.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.980]   His company MyBodyTutor has been a big success because it solves the number one problem in
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.420]   getting healthy, which is consistency.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:10.300]   It's not hard to figure out what you should be doing.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.500]   It's hard to actually do it.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:17.960]   And so what MyBodyTutor offers is a online coach who works with you to develop your plan
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.980]   about nutrition and exercise.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.460]   And then you check in with this coach every day using the MyBodyTutor app.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:30.000]   And that gives you that accountability, is what gives you consistency.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.220]   Knowing you need to talk to your coach every day and report how it went is what gives you
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:38.700]   that extra push you need to actually follow through on the plan you put together.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.900]   In addition, having a coach means you have someone who's on your team when you need to
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.380]   make changes or adjust.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.740]   Maybe you have like a holiday coming up and you want to change, like, how am I going to
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:48.740]   exercise?
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:49.740]   We're going to be traveling.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.740]   What's going to happen with my diet?
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:54.460]   The coach can work with you to make a plan for your specific needs.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.620]   So if you want to get in better shape, I suggest MyBodyTutor.
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:03.460]   If you mention deep questions when you sign up, you will get $50 off your first month.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.820]   So please remember to do that.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:11.680]   So go to MyBodyTutor.com, that's T-U-T-O-R, MyBodyTutor.com, and mention deep questions
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.660]   when you sign up to get $50 off.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.900]   All right, let's do our final segment.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:21.800]   All right, we haven't done a good reaction segment in a while.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.260]   This is where we react to something that has been sent to us from the internet.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.340]   I got an article right now from City Journal.
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:33.140]   I'm going to load this up on the screen for people who are watching instead of listening.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:40.260]   All right, the headline is "Professor M.I.A."
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.060]   And it shows someone reading a book.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:47.460]   I don't know, it looks like the Caribbean, overlooking the water.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.500]   There's a problem, Jesse, that immediately on seeing that picture, my reaction is like,
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.840]   "Oh, I want to do that.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.560]   That guy's got to figure it out."
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.740]   I'm going to read a little bit about this.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.740]   The article starts...
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.740]   I mean, I could really read the whole article.
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:05.100]   I could try to be selective here.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.180]   It starts by saying, "It's no secret that a lot of students are coming to campus unfamiliars
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:14.620]   with skills, habits, and behaviors that are necessary to succeed at college-level work.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:15.620]   Basic things like..."
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.500]   I'm eliding some of the article here.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.780]   "Basic things like the importance of meeting deadlines, paying attention, being respectful
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:24.360]   in the classroom, and more complicated skills like knowing how to annotate readings and
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.660]   cope with time management problems.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:28.660]   Many of the faculty..."
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:31.780]   It's kind of quoting someone here.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.780]   I'm kind of eliding this.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.500]   "Many faculty are uninterested in this kind of instruction because it departs sharply
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.060]   from the role many instructors prefer, that of a knowledge expert who leads learners through
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.100]   the course content."
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:51.320]   As this goes on, "At more elite schools, these issues are also evident.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.480]   Faculty devote less and less time to teaching, leaving students to fend for themselves."
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:05.280]   They're talking about how students are just doing less stuff in the classroom and more
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.040]   stuff on their own.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.040]   The conclusion here is professors aren't doing enough.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.120]   So the article person does some math here, the author.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.880]   "A three-course load over the span of a year is the maximum required for faculty members
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.160]   at these institutions, with a total of 28 weeks of classes, and each class requiring
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.540]   two hours of classroom instruction, the third hour is often conducted by a teaching assistant.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:34.080]   That amounts to about 125 hours of classroom time, or about 15 to 16 eight-hour days.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.200]   Let's add that to the three hours a week that professors spend in office hours, and let's
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.960]   add another full day per week that they spend preparing for classes.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.600]   Let's also add some time spent grading.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.480]   You still wind up with just over 40 full-time days per year.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.200]   Even many faculty administrative duties seem to have disappeared.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.060]   Professors were once responsible not only for chairing a department and advising students,
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.920]   but also for running entire programs.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.880]   They would advise students about studying abroad, combining majors, or enrolling in
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.040]   other interdisciplinary initiatives.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.560]   Now because of ballooning college administrations, faculty have been relieved of many of these
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.080]   roles.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.360]   This has the effect not only of separating many student programs from intellectual pursuits,
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.880]   but also of fostering fewer interactions between students and professors.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:19.000]   The decline in faculty classroom student time has coincided with an explosion in academic
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   publishing.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.140]   No matter what the discipline, faculty are expected to publish their research.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.940]   Is it more worthwhile to impart knowledge to undergraduates, or to write articles for
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.640]   sociology and literature journals?
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:33.900]   All right, so the idea here is professors are lazy.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:39.600]   That if we add up the time we spend teaching in the classroom, it's not that much compared
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600]   to a full-time job.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.200]   And so what are we doing?
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.240]   We must be reading on the beach.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.960]   What we should be doing is spending much more time, I guess, teaching more classes and teaching
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   students the, quote this earlier, "skills like how to read and deal with time management."
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:07:00.160]   Well, first of all, I'll say with this podcast, I think I'm single-handedly taking on for
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.480]   all of my faculty brethren around the world here the obligation to teach our students
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.480]   how to do time management and read and organize their lives.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.920]   So you can say thank you.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.200]   I'm taking on all that time for you.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.320]   Let's step out to the bigger question here.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:19.160]   There is a fundamental misunderstanding, I think, in this article about what it is that
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:25.640]   professors are meant to do, especially at what she calls or he calls elite institutions
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   in the US.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.680]   I think it's probably worth clarifying here.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.820]   Elite institutions in the US follow the German Research University model.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:39.680]   This is something that was kind of innovated in the late 1800s and we picked up here in
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:46.360]   the US in the early 20th century and has been at the core of the US's sort of dominant position
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:51.160]   in science and technology that we've had over the last 100 years.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:59.420]   The German model is a model in which the professor's goal, broadly speaking, is to advance cutting-edge
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:02.640]   knowledge in an area of expertise.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:08.300]   This means research and this means supervising the next generation of scholars to sort of
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:15.960]   continue the promulgation of the body of knowledge, an effort that is mainly captured in doctoral
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:16.960]   student supervision.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.480]   So you're training future professors and researchers and expanding a body of knowledge.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:29.760]   Now in the US system, we marry that research German model.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.660]   We marry that with the college model, right?
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:36.300]   We have this sort of like classic college model in the US, which is about preparing
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:37.300]   undergraduates.
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:45.960]   You know, what we should do is these professors, they should also teach a lot of the classes
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.520]   that the undergraduates are taking so that they can be exposed.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.500]   The undergraduates, as part of their broader training and experience, intellectual and
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:57.320]   otherwise, can be exposed to like leading minds on things.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.920]   They can hear about these topics from the leading subject matter experts and that's
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.160]   kind of like a more inspiring way of learning it.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.400]   It like connects you to the trajectory of the field and that's an important thing.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:16.000]   And so teaching undergraduates is an important piece of academic life at research institutions.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.880]   It is far from the core though.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:24.480]   So it is somewhat absurd to be counting the time that like world-class subject matter
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.420]   experts at research universities spend teaching undergraduates and say somehow that should
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.680]   be the thing you do that matters.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:36.320]   It's an important piece, like it's a good complement to what a professor does at a research
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.320]   university.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.940]   We take teaching undergraduates seriously.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:46.060]   But the idea that this is what the bulk of our time should be actually is not compatible
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.640]   with the model of these universities.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:55.280]   The focus on which promotion happens at US research universities, so promotion to associate
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:00.400]   professor of tenure and subsequent promotion to full professor.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.480]   Those promotions are based almost entirely on intellectual contribution to the world
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.960]   of ideas.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.600]   Teaching is involved in these cases but only as a disqualifier.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.360]   If you are bad in the classroom, that can and should hold you back from being promoted.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.520]   We do not want a professor at one of these institutions who cannot teach well.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.040]   But you cannot get promoted on being a good teacher.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.040]   The thing that gets you promoted is confidential letters solicited from subject matter experts
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:34.840]   in your field that starkly and frankly assess the intellectual caliber of your work.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.580]   How good is his or her work?
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.760]   What is its impact on the field?
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.520]   What institutions would this person be promoted at?
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.980]   What institutions would they not be promoted at?
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:49.000]   Who in their similar rank are they comparable to?
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.240]   Who at their similar rank is better?
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.560]   These are really kind of frank and somewhat brutal letters.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.280]   So the promotion process emphasizes advancing the world of ideas.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.600]   And I think this is actually a very good model.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.760]   This focus on trying to induce top minds to become subject matter experts does push forward
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.760]   knowledge.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.680]   And again, it's the US's embrace of this research institution model is why on so many different
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.480]   fields we lead in the world.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.840]   And it makes a really big difference.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.320]   So it is a good model.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.720]   And I like the aspect of the model that says, OK, you should spend time with undergraduates
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.280]   teaching some classes.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.360]   This article says people teach three.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.200]   Actually, at the real elite universities, they teach two or less.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.360]   That is not a problem.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:41.840]   Having a world-class physicist spend most of their time in the classroom doesn't make
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.920]   as much sense as having a world-class physicist teaching some of the physics classes so that
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.400]   students can be exposed and excited, but also spending a lot of time trying to advance their
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.020]   understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.020]   So whatever.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:58.180]   This is not particularly relevant, I guess, to people's day-to-day here.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.620]   But I wanted to give a little bit of defensive professoredom.
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.980]   We take undergraduate teaching seriously.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.660]   We are not primarily teachers.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:13.100]   And it's interesting, I think, for a lot of undergraduates or parents of undergraduates
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.020]   who are used to having this employer-employee relationship with universities.
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.700]   Everyone works for me and my kids.
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.700]   It's a little bit different to see.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:25.540]   Oh, there's a whole model and purpose for these universities that goes beyond just the
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:30.420]   experience of the 18 and 22-year-olds who are there, who are the future, and we want
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.420]   to have a good experience.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:33.900]   But it's not the whole orientation of the university.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:37.820]   It's not just entirely about serving that population.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.500]   So I don't know.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.500]   There we go.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.500]   Professors aren't lazy.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.500]   It's a hard job.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.860]   It's hard to advance knowledge in your field.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.780]   It's hard to have a job where you're fired unless you can prove to experts in your field
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.940]   that you have significantly moved the needle.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:52.980]   It's one of the few jobs.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.380]   You can't just keep it by doing good work and being reliable and getting things done.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.220]   It's a job you have to keep earning to keep.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.900]   It's a very difficult job, and it's an exciting job.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:02.900]   And I think it's a good system.
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.500]   And we love undergrads.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.460]   But we shouldn't be teaching more.
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.340]   Are you still writing a lot of papers?
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.340]   I'm doing more now.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.340]   Yes.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:15.940]   Though more-- I'm working on some papers right now that are more in the digital ethics realm
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.220]   and less in theoretical computer science.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:24.060]   So I'm sort of exploring the academic world surrounding technology and society.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.060]   Mm-hmm.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.060]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.060]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:28.060]   And I'm teaching.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.060]   Teaching math in the spring.
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:31.820]   Looking forward to it.
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:32.820]   But give me four more classes.
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:36.060]   I don't know who that's helping, because I couldn't do anything else.
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:39.260]   Any of the research I'm doing, any of the papers, any of the programs-- oh, and by the
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:44.580]   way, all the things you say professors don't do anymore, all the things you say you would--
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.500]   like advising students on majors and study abroad programs.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.500]   That's all I do.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.640]   I'm the director of undergraduate studies.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640]   That's all we do.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.860]   It is true that administrators-- there's many more administrators at college campuses than
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.860]   before.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:01.060]   Those administrators are not serving professors that take stuff off their plate.
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:03.100]   They largely generate new work for the professors.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.940]   They're running programs and new initiatives.
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:12.100]   The increase in administrators on campuses does not reduce the administrative work that
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.100]   professors do.
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:14.100]   I think it only increases it.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.100]   I just want to push back on that.
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.100]   So there we go.
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:19.740]   A little apologia, as they say, for the academic life.
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:20.740]   All right.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.300]   Well, thank you, everyone, for listening.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.460]   I think my voice barely held out.
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.780]   One day I will have my voice back, but I think we made it through, so I'm happy about that.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.620]   We'll be back next week with another episode, and until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:36.780]   Hey, if you liked today's discussion about the discipline ladder, you should also listen
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:43.580]   to episode 310, which is titled "Rethinking Discipline," where I focus on another way
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.860]   to increase your discipline capacity.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.900]   Check it out.
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:54.380]   So I've been thinking a lot recently about discipline, and I don't mean punishing other
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:55.500]   people.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:01.460]   I also don't mean those performative shows on social media where you brag about how many
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:06.580]   miles you can run or how many minutes you can survive a cold plunge.
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:13.460]   I mean instead the quiet contentment of consistently making progress on things that are hard right
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:19.780]   now, but move you towards meaningful goals in the future.
