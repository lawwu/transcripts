[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   As for how to invest the money
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.960]   in your taxable brokerage account,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.600]   I don't think it has to be fancy.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.600]   You can build really serious wealth
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.820]   by just investing passively in low-cost index funds or ETFs.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.420]   I'm not trying to beat the market.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.960]   I'm not trying to time the market.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.240]   The majority of my money is in index funds
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.160]   just trying to match the market performance.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.740]   I do personally like to be diversified
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.520]   across sectors and geographies.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.920]   So some of those are international.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.840]   Some of those are US-based.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.740]   But I do have a bit of diversification
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.640]   in a couple different index funds.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.920]   I also like to align the portfolio I have
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.460]   and I would recommend everyone think about
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.900]   their own level of risk tolerance
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.780]   and how much they're willing to stomach a drop
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.760]   if the market changes
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.940]   because that's an important thing
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.940]   that if you haven't experienced it before,
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.280]   it can be a little bit tough to experience.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.740]   And then I would just really avoid
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.620]   over-trading, unnecessary complexity.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.620]   I don't like to spend a lot of time
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.560]   in my brokerage account thinking about it at all.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.800]   In fact, most of mine is automated
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.980]   and it's not something I check on a daily basis.
