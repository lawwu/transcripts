[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Galatians in the sixth chapter and the fifteenth verse.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   The fifteenth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Now to get the context of this let me read to you from verse thirteen, for you notice that this verse obviously links with the previous verse.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   The word "for" at the beginning of the verse tells us that.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So we go back to verse twelve.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision availeth anything, but a new creature, or a new creation.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Now those who attend here regularly will know that for many, many Sunday nights we've been considering together that great fourteenth verse.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   But we didn't begin to consider the fourteenth verse without going further back in order that we had the context of that also.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Here at the end of this epistle to the Galatians, the great apostle having dealt with his big major theme, is as it were, towards the end of the letter, summing up his message.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Driving home the big points that he wants to leave in the minds of these people.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So that is the context in which we must look at this text that we're looking at tonight.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   You see the problem, the question with which the apostle is dealing here is that of the misunderstanding of Christianity, the misunderstanding of the Christian life.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   That's why the apostle is writing at all. He had been preaching in this part of the world and people had believed and had become members of the Christian church.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   But certain other teachers with a false teaching had gone round and they'd been telling these believers, these Gentiles who now had become Christians, that that was all right.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But if they wanted to be truly Christian, they must also as Jews be circumcised. That though they were Gentiles, they must submit to circumcision.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   That that was commanded in the law of God and that they would not be complete as Christians unless they had submitted themselves to this.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   That was the heresy which was troubling the churches of Galatia, that was the circumstance which led the great apostle to write this particular letter to them.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Now I'm putting it in general. What these false teachers were doing was to confuse these people as to the Christian life.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And it is because there is so much of that present at this present time that I'm calling your attention to this whole subject.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   In other words, we can make a great general statement at the very beginning.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   All our natural ideas with regard to what Christianity is and with regard to what salvation is, are altogether and entirely wrong.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Now that's putting it boldly, that's putting it bluntly. But the apostles' word that we're looking at tonight compels us to do that.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   You see, we've seen already at great length that men and women are in fundamental error, even with the question of forgiveness.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   They don't realize that there's only one way of forgiveness, and that is by the death of the Son of God upon the cross.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   They don't realize that. Nothing is more ignored or misunderstood than the cross of Christ in its true and fundamental meaning.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   People still think that they can save themselves. The apostle says, "No, God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world." The very first ideas to become a Christian is altogether wrong.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   This cross, as we've seen, has been a stumbling block to people throughout the running centuries, and it is still a stumbling block to masses of people at the present time.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   But the apostle goes on to say, here in this 15th verse, that people are not only wrong with respect to the way in which you can enter the Christian life,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   but they're equally wrong in their notions and ideas as to what the Christian life is when you have entered into it.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Now that's the theme of this 15th verse. You notice the apostle writes very strongly. He was a vehement character, I know, but that isn't the reason why he writes so strongly.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The apostle writes with vehemence. He writes with this power. He says, "God forbid that I should glory," and here he says, "Your circumcision and your uncircumcision are nothing."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Why is he so vehement? Well, the answer is this. It is his concern for men and women, and that they should have the right and the true notion of the Christian life.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Now, the great apostle, as he heard of this false teaching, was filled with a sense of righteous indignation.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   This flabby generation to which you and I belong, and which seems to think that we should praise everything, and that we should never denounce anything, however false it may be,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   is about as far removed from the mind and the mentality of the New Testament as anything can possibly be.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You remember how this man puts it at the very beginning. He bursts out, even at the very beginning of his letter, and says,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   "I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel which is not another.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And then he makes this astonishing statement, "But though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   let him be accursed." And then he repeats it, "As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that he have received,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   let him be accursed. Let a curse come down upon him in this life and in the world to come, any man who preaches any other gospel."
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Now, why does the apostle speak like this? Why is he so vehement? Why is he so concerned?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Well, I say it is because he is concerned about the souls and the well-being of these members of the churches.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   He is anxious that everybody should come to a knowledge of this salvation that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And he hears of this new teaching. And he sees that the main effect of that teaching is to make this glorious, wonderful gospel of salvation
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   into something small and petty and narrow and legalistic. And his righteous soul is aroused.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   The very idea that men should be reducing this gospel and its glory to such a little petty thing.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   He hates the thought and he sets out to denounce it and he spends the whole of his time in the whole of the letter doing so.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And here he is at the very end repeating it all once more. And my dear friends, my desire tonight as best I can
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   is to convey to you something of what it was that made the apostle feel so strongly.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   What is your idea of the Christian life? Is it something big? Is it something grand? Is it something great and noble?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Is it to you the biggest thing in the world tonight? Or do you regard it as something rather small and narrow?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   There are many who regard it as such. And they are amazed that anybody should still be concerned about these things and be Christians.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Their whole notion of the Christian life is that it is just a series of prohibitions and vetoes and restraints, mere negatives.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And that you live some little cramped, cabined and confined life. There are many who think of it like that.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   There are many others to whom it's a task, a great task under which they sweat and strain.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   My dear friends, that's an utter travesty of Christianity. And that's what the apostle is trying to show at this point.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   He says, "Look here, in Christ Jesus, it's nothing like that. It's altogether different. It's a new creature.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's a new creation." He says, "All your ideas about this are absolutely wrong.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And we need to repeat the same thing in this our day and generation.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I don't care what your idea by nature is of the Christian life. I tell you it's wrong.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Christianity is infinitely bigger and greater than anybody's ever conceived of."
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Now, the Bible expresses that, you see, in the kind of language we've got in this verse tonight.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   "In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision."
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well, what does avail? A new creation. A new creature.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Now, these are the characteristic terms of the New Testament as it describes this great life.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Our Lord interrupted Nicodemus, you remember, and put it to him by saying,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   You see, when it's put like that, that we need to be born again before we can know anything at all about it,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   it means that every idea that we have with respect to it as we are is wrong.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   We need a new creation. We need to be made new creatures.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   The thing is so utterly and entirely different from what man thinks by nature,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   that it is indeed the difference between death and life, the difference between nonexistence and existence.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Very well, let's work it out together as the Apostle puts it here before us.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   He puts it, first you notice, in the form of a negative.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   He says, "In Christ Jesus." When you come to this,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   "Circumcision is nothing, or avails nothing, nor uncircumcision either."
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Now that's important that we should take the two,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   because when he says that circumcision availeth nothing, nor uncircumcision,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   what he is really saying is that all that the Jews are holding on to so much and are bursting in is nothing,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and it's exactly the same with the Gentiles. Circumcision belonged to the Jews,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   the uncircumcision covers all who are not Jews, all who are Gentiles.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   So you see, it's a very comprehensive term. It's all inclusive.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   It includes everything, it includes the whole world.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He says, "Look here, when you come to this realm, I don't care what you've got,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   it is absolutely irrelevant, it doesn't make the slightest difference at all."
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Now I sometimes put that in this particular way and manner.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   This is the only realm that I'm aware of in which a man's antecedents and previous history
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   is really quite irrelevant and doesn't matter at all.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   In every other realm it is of importance. You go to a doctor, he wants to hear the story,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   he wants to know your past history, what sort of health you've had, what diseases you've had,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   he wants to know about your father and mother and your grandparents' family history.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   It all helps him to arrive at a diagnosis.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And in most walks and departments of life and professions,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   these things have their interest and their importance.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But you know, my friends, the moment you come through those doors into this place,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   here where Christ Jesus is, and where we are in the realm of the Gospel,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   nothing of that matters at all. It's quite irrelevant. Circumcision and uncircumcision.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   In other words, as a preacher of the Gospel, I'm not at all interested to know the details of people's lives.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Why not? Well, I know that the same thing is true of all of them.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   I know that everybody's a sinner, and it doesn't matter very much what form the sin takes.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   It matters socially, but it doesn't matter spiritually.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   You see, here, we're in a different realm.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Out in the world, these things matter. All these divisions and distinctions.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   So you divide yourselves up according to these.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   But the moment you come here, they're all completely abolished.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   What does this mean? Well, let me put it in more particular terms for you.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   My contention is, and this is the teaching of the New Testament everywhere,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   that all we have is utterly and completely useless when we come and face Jesus Christ,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   or when we consider this great question of salvation.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   First, let me put it like this, that the things done to us make no difference, and they don't help us.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Look at circumcision.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Every male child born to the Jews was circumcised on the eighth day.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Now that was something that was commended by God himself.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And yet here's an apostle saying, "Circumcision is nothing."
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   How do you reconcile these two things? Oh, you reconcile them like this.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   The Jews have got into the bad habit of thinking that it was circumcision that put you right with God.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Whereas if you go back and read the story of the origin of circumcision,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   you will see that it was a sign that was given to Abraham, not to make him right, but because he was right.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   He didn't become a man of God by means of circumcision.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   He was given the sign and the seal of circumcision because he had believed God,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   and because he was righteous and justified in the sight of God as a result of that faith.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   But the foolish Jews, "Ah," they said to these Galatians,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   "it's all right to believe the gospel, but you know, if you want to be perfect, you've got to be circumcised.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   You must come under this, you must come under the law."
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And they were trying to press these Christian people back under the mosaic law
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   under which they themselves had been brought up.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   So the apostle puts it very boldly and very bluntly by saying,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   "Since the Son of God has come, since Christ Jesus has come, circumcision is not the thing that matters.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It isn't that he despises being a Jew, he was very proud of the fact that he was a Jew.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   But he knows that there is nothing that is quite so fatal as to rely upon circumcision,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   this thing that is done to you, as if that put you right with God."
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Or to put it in modern terms, "Baptism is neither here nor there in Christ Jesus."
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   You see, this is something done to us, and there are so many who think that that is what makes them Christian.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   You ask them, "You're a Christian?" "Yes, I am a Christian."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   You say, "Why do you say you're a Christian?" "Well, I was baptized when I was an infant,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   brought up in a Christian family, taken to church."
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And they think that that makes them Christians. Virily they believe that.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Now it is to such people that the apostle says, "Circumcision availeth nothing."
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Nothing that is done to us by others avails at all at this point. It's irrelevant.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And on the other hand, he tells us that the absence of that is of no value either.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   But wait a minute, let me go on with my classification.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   "Nothing is done to us," don't say this. Are you relying on anything that's been done to you?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   You're not responsible for your birth. You happen to have been born in this country.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Is that why you think you're a Christian?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Or is it, I ask, because you were christened or baptized, or certain things were done to you?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Is that the basis? If it is, the apostle tells you it's irrelevant. It doesn't matter at all.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   This is a very wonderful thing, but it's a very true thing.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And it's to me the great romance in preaching this gospel.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It matters not to the slightest extent whether you've always gone to a place of worship
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   or whether this is the first time in your life you've ever been to a place of worship.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   From the standpoint of salvation, it makes no difference.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   There is an equal opportunity for all, for in Christ Jesus, none of these things matter.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Very well, none of the things that are done to us.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And so we have to realize that none of the things that we do ourselves are of any value here either.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Now this takes it a step further.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   None of the things that we have done are of the slightest significance or relevance
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   in the realm of Christ Jesus.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   This is the sort of thing that shocks people.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   This is the kind of thing that the modern unbelieving man so hates and abominates.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   He feels that we who are preachers of the evangelical gospel are almost anti-moral.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   That's his fallacy, that's his complete misunderstanding.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   But I am here to say this, that when you come face to face with God,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   when you come into this realm of Christ Jesus, your morality avails nothing.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It is completely irrelevant.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   So that all your morality, all your goodness, all your benevolence,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   all your kind deeds and actions, they are completely irrelevant.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   If you rely upon these, they are the greatest hindrance and the greatest stumbling block.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   In Christ Jesus, these things don't count.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Religion doesn't count.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Isn't this an extraordinary thing to have to say?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   But my dear friends, if you read the history of the Christian church,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   you will see very clearly that religion has generally been the greatest enemy of true Christianity.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   You go back and read about the Middle Ages,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   and you read of the treatment meted out to people like John Wycliffe in this country
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   and John Hus in Moravia by the Roman Catholic Church and its religiosity,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   and you'll see exactly what I mean.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It is the religion that has always persecuted the true message.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Religion, church attendance, church membership, prayers, fasting, taking communion,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   these things that people do.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   The apostle says that in Christ Jesus, they don't matter, they don't count at all.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   What, says somebody, do you mean to say that the fact that I've always been religious makes no difference?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I say this, that may be the very greatest obstacle of all to your becoming a Christian.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Because you're resting on it, you're relying upon it, you think that this puts you right with God.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   That's been the great fight of the centuries.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Here it is in the epistle to the Galatians,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   as it is to be found subsequently in the history of the Christian church.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   So that the things that are done to us, quite irrelevant.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I really am not interested whether you were baptized when you were a child or not.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   In the matter of your salvation, it is a complete irrelevance.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   We don't believe in baptismal regeneration.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   We don't believe that when water is sprinkled on an infant, it is right to say,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   "This child is now regenerate."
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   We don't say either that though a man is baptized when he's an adult,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   that he is of necessity regenerated.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   No outward act can make a man a Christian.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And we mustn't rely upon any of these externals.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   So our religion, and all these things attached to it,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   we must realize when we come here are completely irrelevant,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   unless we know the Lord Jesus Christ and are truly in him.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   But I want to show you also, because the apostle puts the other side as well.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   There is circumcision, there is religion, there is the position of the Jew in the Old Testament,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   or the religious person at the present time.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   But he says, "Look here, you other people,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   don't you imagine either that your lack of it is of any value?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision."
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And there are many people today boasting in the uncircumcision.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   What does that mean?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Well, they're boasting in their own thinking.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   They say, "Oh, we don't go to a place of worship.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   We don't indulge in that shibboleth any longer.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   We are no longer emotionalists and so on."
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   But they think they're good people,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   and they think they're good people because they're thinkers,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   because they've got the right ideas.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Now, there are many such people.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   These are the uncircumcision.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And they think that these activities of theirs,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   they're very different from those of the religious person,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   but they think these activities of theirs are going to put them right,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   and really make of them good people.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Now, let me give you one or two examples that I've come across recently,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   which I think show this very clearly.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I was reading, as probably many of you did,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   an interview with that great violinist Yehudi Minuwin,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and he said this very interesting thing.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   He said that from his birth, from the days of childhood,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   he'd always been very grieved by wrong and injustice and suffering.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   And then he went on to say,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   "I thought I could convert people by talking to them."
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I know now that it takes much more than that.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   He still doesn't mean Christianity,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   but at any rate, he's been disabused about the first idea,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   which is, of course, the prevailing popular idea.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Wrongs and injustices in the world, what's necessary?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Talk to people about them.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Tell them they're wrong.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Expose them.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Hold the thing before them.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Once you've done that, people will rise up,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   and they'll put them right.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   We've, many of us, passed through that phase,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   that phase of ignorant idealism.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   "I thought I could convert people by talking to them."
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   You see, they've just got the wrong ideas,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   and all they need is to have the right ideas.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   So what you do is to talk to them and tell them what books to read,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and these new ideas will gradually begin to control them,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and they'll become different people,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   and they'll be converted and changed,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   and they'll begin to right the wrongs and mitigate the injustices.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   But here is a man who's still not a Christian
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   who says, "I've discovered that that doesn't happen."
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   It isn't as simple as that.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   You are uncircumcision with its confidence in political action
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   or philosophical thought and reading books and so on.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   It's equally useless.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   So you see, the whole world is included here.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Or let me give you another illustration under this particular heading.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   A public schoolmaster,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   giving his impressions of this notorious book, Honest to God,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   he said that this was his experience.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   "We do not, in general," he said,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   "have fruitful discussions on God as transcendent.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   We have to teach the young, I suppose, to think existentially."
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And one day, they will,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   just as the 17th century philosophers
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   had to teach people to think in terms of scientific explanations.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And it took many years before most people did.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   I think that needs a little interpretation, doesn't it?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   You see, this is the modern sophistication.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   "I don't find it very fruitful," says this public schoolmaster,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   "to have discussions with boys about God transcendent.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   They don't seem to be capable of thinking in those terms and categories.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   We have to teach the young, I suppose, to think existentially."
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   That means just this,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   that instead of thinking in terms of ideas or propositions,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   you think in terms of your encounter with God,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   thinking existentially.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Don't worry about that.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   But this is the thing that I am concerned about.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   He said, "I suppose we've got to do this,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   and that one day, well, they will begin to think existentially."
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And then he gets an illustration,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   just as the 17th century philosophers
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   had to teach people to think in terms of scientific explanations.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And it took many years before most people did so.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   So you see, this is the problem.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Here we are in the 20th century, modern scientific men.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Gosh, no use preaching that old gospel to him.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Can't take it.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   He doesn't believe in the supernatural and the miraculous.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   It isn't true.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   He knows this is folklore.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   This is just myth.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   But now, he must talk to him and think with him
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   in different categories altogether.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   "Ah, yes, but this isn't very easy."
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   "It's all right," says this man.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   "It's all right," say these teachers.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   This sort of thing, you know, has happened before.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   The great scientific discoveries of the 16th and early 17th centuries
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   were very revolutionary,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and people had been brought up with a certain way
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   of looking at the world and the cosmos,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and all this came in as a great revolution.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   And they found it very difficult to start thinking scientifically.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   However, the philosophers were patient,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   and they went on repeating it,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   and at long last, the people slowly but certainly and gradually
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   began to learn how to think in that particular way.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And that's what you and I have got to do now.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   We've got to read the latest books.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   We've got to learn to think existentially.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   We've got to drop all the old categories,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   and we've got to get these new ideas.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   It's going to be difficult, but we must persist, my friends.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And after many years, probably some of us will begin to think existentially.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   That's bringing in your uncircumcision.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   The one man trusts to the fact that he was baptized.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   The second man trusts to his great brain,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   his great understanding,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   his great power of apprehension and of comprehension,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   his ability to deal with these great terms and categories and ideas.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   He brings his uncircumcision.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Of course, he wouldn't dream of relying upon baptism.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   He doesn't take communion. He doesn't worship.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   He doesn't sing hymns. He's a great thinker.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   He relies upon his uncircumcision,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   as the Greeks and the Romans were doing at this very time
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   when the apostle was writing.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Now, this is the modern popular notion and idea.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   But what I'm here to say tonight in the name of God
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   and in expounding this particular scripture is this,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   that they're all wrong, utterly and absolutely wrong.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   That the one is no better than the other.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   That your religiosity is no better than your philosophy.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   That your great brain and understanding is no better than your superstition.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   They're all completely irrelevant.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   In Christ Jesus,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Well, what does avail here?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Well, he gives us the answer, and that's my second point.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   What matters here, what is absolutely essential,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   is a new creation.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Thank God for it.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   I don't have to wait for years to accustom myself to the new terminology
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   and the new notions and ideas as people did in the 17th century with science.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Thank God, I say, isn't that why I may not be here next week.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Thank God it isn't this long process.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   We may not have the time to indulge in the long process.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   The gospel, I say, is something that is altogether above and beyond.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Your circumcision or uncircumcision are equally irrelevant.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   What matters? Well, he says, a new creature.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   A new creation.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   A new birth.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   A new start. A new beginning.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   How do you become a Christian?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   You become a Christian first by becoming a blank.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   How do you become a Christian?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   You become a Christian by becoming a fool.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   How do you become a Christian?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   You become a Christian by becoming nothing.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   So you come to the doorstep of the church, as it were,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   with bags in your hands, your religion or your anti-religion,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   your circumcision or uncircumcision,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and the gospel tells you, leave them all outside.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   They are of no value here.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   They are a hindrance.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   They are an obstacle.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   They are a nuisance.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   And above everything else, they are unnecessary.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Why?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Well, because the great message here is a new creation.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   What's that?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Well, a new creation, you see, is not an addition to what you have already.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   That's not a creation, that's an addition.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Creation means making something out of nothing.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   That's how God made the world.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   He made it out of nothing.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   It isn't creation if there was anything there.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Creation is producing something out of nothing, nothing at all.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And the New Testament way of describing the Christian is that he is a new creation.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   There was nothing there.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Knock out the circumcision, knock out the uncircumcision, take away everything.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   There's nothing there.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   That's our position, every one of us.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   So it's not an addition.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Neither is it an improvement.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Neither is it a supplement.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   Neither is it something that you and I can take up.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Oh, my dear friends, I am so anxious at the beginning of a new year like this
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   that we should all be plain and clear about these things.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   If you think that you can take up Christianity as you can take up communism or Marxism
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   or liberalism or conservatism or socialism or any interest, philosophic or anything else,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   if you think you can take this up as you take them up, you've misunderstood the whole thing.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   You can't.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   There's nothing there to take anything up.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   You are, as it were, nonexistent.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   You are nothing.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   You've got nothing at all.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   A man who takes something up must be there to take it up.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   But we are not here.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   All we have and all we boast of has become nothing.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   We are ciphers.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   We are blanks.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   We need to be created anew.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And this is the great and glorious message of the New Testament.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   The Son of God came into the world in order that he might die on that cross
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   and thereby absolve us of the guilt of our sins and reconcile us to God
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   in order that God might give us this new birth,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   might make new men and women of us, might give us a new nature,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   might put a new principle of life into us.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Christianity doesn't modify my ideas or add to what I've already got.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   It's absolutely new.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   It's a new way of thinking. It's a new way of feeling.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   It's a new way of acting.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   A new creation.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   It brings into being something that wasn't there at all.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Now, I said at the beginning that the great apostle was very vehement,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   that he uses these strong expressions right through the whole of this epistle,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   especially at the beginning and at the end.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Why does he do so?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Well, I can put it very simply to you.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   You see, when the apostle heard that these men were going around
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   and saying that after all what makes a man a true Christian is that he submits to circumcision
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and that he doesn't eat certain meats and that he does eat others
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   and that he keeps to certain rules and regulations and laws
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   and that that is Christianity,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   his whole nature revolted against it.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   He said, "You know what these men are doing?"
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   He said, "They are trying to get you to be what I once was."
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And you know, says the apostle, if I'd remained as that I'd never have come to preach to you.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   He says, "I am no longer Saul of Tarsus and they're trying to make Saul of Tarsus out of you."
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   That's what I was.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   And it was narrow, nationalistic and proud and self-righteous and highly moral and religious.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   But oh, what a small, narrow little thing it was.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I've been liberated. I've been set free.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   I'm enjoying the glorious liberty of the children of God.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And these men are trying to get you back in fetters and chains.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I must denounce them, he says.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   That's why the apostle is so concerned.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And I'm concerned, my friend, because I find there are still large numbers of people
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   who think that that is Christianity.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   That you just stop doing certain things and start doing others.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   That is involved, you know, but not in the way they think.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   I don't stand up here and give rules and regulations as to what people should do and what they shouldn't do.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   That's not my notion of Christianity at all.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   I've never believed in a Christianity by numbers.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Christianity is that which makes a man a new man.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   It gives him a new heart. It gives him a new mind.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   He thinks differently. He sees everything differently.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   There's a new principle of life put into him.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   I read at the beginning of the seventh chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   If I'd gone on to the second verse of the eighth chapter, I'd have read this.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   "The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   "I'm a liberated man," he says.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   "I no longer walk after the flesh, but after the spirit."
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   It's altogether different.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   The difference between the apostle Paul and Saul of Tarsus
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   is the difference between a man who is bursting of circumcision or uncircumcision
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   and a man who is bursting in the cross of Christ and living the Christian life.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   No, no.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   All those other things are useless here because
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   they cannot do what is necessary for our well-being and our salvation.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   A new birth, a new nature, a new creation is an absolute essential.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Why? Well, I needn't keep you.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   This is the great theme of the New Testament.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Why does the Christian have to be born again?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Why does he have to be a new creature or a new creation?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And the answer put very simply is this, that man's fundamental need is his need of God.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   What man needs is not new or better ideas.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   What he needs is not just to be improved or live a better life.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Man's fundamental need is the need of God.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   He's been made to know God and he can't be happy without Him.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   His whole nature is so constructed and constituted that he can't function properly
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   except he's in the right relationship to God.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   That's the fundamental need of man.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   He must be in correspondence with God.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   How can he be?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   If you're in any doubt as to why this new creation is essential
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   and as to why everything else is useless, look at it like this.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Consider as best you can the character of God.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Whenever you're going to meet some great, noble, august person,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   you're very conscious of their character, aren't you?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Their character, their position.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   We discriminate as we go and meet different people.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   We say, "This is going to be a great privilege. I'm going to meet a very great person."
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   And obviously you're on your best behavior.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   You realize what a tremendous thing it is.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Well, now you've got to multiply that by infinity.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And there you think of men face to face with God.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   God is truth, God is holiness, God is righteousness, God is justice.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   God is of such a pure countenance that He cannot look upon sin.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   You know, these are the things we are told in the Bible about God.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   And our Lord turned to the Pharisees one afternoon and He said,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   "You are they that justify yourselves before men, but God seeth the heart.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   For that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of God."
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Oh, God looks through us. He knows all about us.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   He knows the state of our heart.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   That's why David cries out in his anguish in Psalm 51,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   "Thou desirest truth in the inward parts."
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   The blind man in the ninth of John said the very truth to Christ when he said,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   "God heareth not sinners."
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   My dear friends, it's all very well to argue about these things theoretically,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   but the problem is, how can a man meet God?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   How can a man know God? How can a man be blessed of God?
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   That's what we all need, is the blessing of God.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And He only blesses those whom He loves, those who are His children.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   But listen to an argument like this.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   The apostle writing to the Corinthians in the second epistle says,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   "Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers."
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Why? For this reason.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   "What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   What communion hath light with darkness?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Or what conquered hath Christ with Belial?
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   For ye are the temple of the living God."
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   You see, you can't mix light and darkness.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   They're eternal opposites.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   There's no compromise possible between light and darkness.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   And God is light, and we are darkness.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   You see, that's why all this other talk is so useless.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   What's it matter whether you're circumcised or not,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   when you stand before that eternal uncreated being,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   which is the holiness of God's character.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   How ridiculous, how childish it is.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Your circumcision or your uncircumcision.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And God dwells in the everlasting light and in the everlasting burnings.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   A little hymn puts it so perfectly.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   "There is a city bright, closed of its gates to sin,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   naught that defileth shall ever enter in."
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   God dwelleth in a light that is unapproachable,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   whom no man hath seen or can see.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   We can't visualize it.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   We have the symbols of the book of Revelations and others,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   but we can't imagine it.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   God, in his glory and majesty, in his perfection,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   all the absolute character of his qualities.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   And we need to know him, and we need to be blessed with him,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   and we need to have fellowship with him.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   That's the first reason why a new creation is necessary.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   But then look at it from our standpoint.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   If that is the truth about God, what's the truth about us?
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Well, it's almost exactly the opposite.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   The apostle in the fifth chapter of this epistle to the Galatians
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   talks about what he calls the life of the flesh,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   and this is how he describes it.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   He says, "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   seditions, heresies, envying, murders,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   drunkenness, revelings, and such like.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Of which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   that they which do such things
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   How can they?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Can you take things like that into the presence of God?
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Can you take things like that into heaven?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Can you take your adulteries and your fornications
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   and your drunkenness and your jealousy and pettiness and malice and spite,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   can you take them to the things impossible?
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   But that is men by nature.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Our Lord had put the whole thing so plainly before.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   In the fifteenth chapter of the gospel, according to St. Matthew,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   people had expressed surprise that he sat down to meet on one occasion
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   without washing his hands.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   And he said, "Do you not understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   goeth out in the belly and is cast out into the draught?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   But those things which proceed out of the mouth
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   come forth from the heart, and they defile the men.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   thefts, false witness, blasphemies.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   These are the things that defile a man,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   but to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man."
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   My dear friends, that's the trouble with all of us.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   It isn't our circumstances, it is our evil hearts.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   The natural mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   neither indeed can be.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   That is why, you see, when the Son of God came into this world
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   and did his marvelous deeds and lived that perfect life
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   and spoke as never men had spoken and died to express the love of God,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   the world said, "Away with him!
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   It didn't want him and it doesn't want him tonight. Why not?"
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Here's the answer.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   This is the condemnation,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   that light is come into the world,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   but men love darkness rather than light,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   because their deeds were evil.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   What men need, you see, is not even forgiveness.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   He does need that, but even that isn't enough.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   He needs more. He needs a renewal.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   He needs a new heart, a new beginning.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   He needs to be made a new man.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   And what's the value of bringing your externals here?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Does the fact that you were christened when you were a child
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   mean that your heart is clean?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Is it the case that every man who has been christened when he was a child
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   is never guilty of adultery and fornication and all the other evils?
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Is the fact that you were christened when a child
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   mean that you're not guilty of jealousy, malice, spite, envy, hatred
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   and all these other things?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   How monstrous it is!
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   What's the value of your philosophy when you come to this realm?
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   No, no, my dear friends.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   These things are of no value to us.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   We may have the knowledge, but it doesn't help us.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   That's why I read to you that seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   At the beginning he says, "I know the law is spiritual, but I am carnal.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   For that which I do I allow not, and what I would that I do not,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   but what I hate that I do."
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   And that's true of every one of us.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   You may have the right knowledge and information, but it doesn't help you.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Your heart's stronger than your mind.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Your lust, desire, passion, these instincts are stronger
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   than our reason and our intellect.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   That's why the world is as it is.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   And so it is utterly useless for us to rely on circumcision or on circumcision.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   There's a very wonderful statement made about Philip Melanchthon,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   who was the great helper and co-adjutor, you remember, with Martin Luther.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   He said that he'd made the discovery that old Adam was too strong for young Melanchthon,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   and that human corruption was too strong for human persuasion without divine grace.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   This man thought, "All I've got to do is to preach now.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I believe the truth. I'm going to be entirely different.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   There'll never be another problem."
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   He found it wasn't true.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Old Adam was too strong for young Melanchthon.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   And that without the power of divine grace, we are all helpless and we are all hopeless.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   So you can be circumcised, you can become religious, you can fast and pray,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   you can do alms, deeds and goods, and good deeds,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   you can sacrifice a great career and start a hospital, if you like, in Central Africa.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   You can make tremendous sacrifices.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   But if you're not a new creation, all you're doing is to put good clothing on corruption.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   All you're doing is to clean the skin a bit and to leave the foulness and the festering within.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   You're like the Pharisees, of whom our Lord said that they were like whited sepulchres.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   They whitewashed the externals of the sepulchres,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   but inside there is the rotting and the rottenness of corrupting bodies and bones.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   So you see, the moment you face God and face yourself as you really are,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   you're no longer surprised that the Apostle says that in Christ Jesus,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   "Neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision, but what o'er new creation."
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   All wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   I like the law of God with my mind, but there's another law in my members,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   and I'm fighting, struggling. I want, I can't. I don't want to, but I do.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Here I am, what can I do? I'm damned, I'm lost.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   My philosophy's no good, nothing's any good.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   All wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   And there's only one answer.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   What we all need is a new heart, a clean heart, a new mind, new desires, a new will, a new everything.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   And my dear friend, that's the very thing that's offered you in the Gospel.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   That's the thing the Apostle had been preaching to the Galatians and they'd believed it.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   And these other people were trying to take it back,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   and trying to reduce them to a number of rules and regulations.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   "Out upon it," says the Apostle, "don't listen to them, anathema come upon them."
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   They're robbing the Gospel of its glory for the Gospel is that which teaches us
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   that in Christ Jesus we are not only forgiven, but we are given a new birth and a new start.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Old things have passed away.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Behold, all things have become new.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   You and I can never make ourselves Christians.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Try it, circumcision, try it along the uncircumcision,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   you'll end always inevitably in utter failure and disaster.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   There is only one who can create, and that is the Almighty God.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And the essential message of Christianity is that it is God who makes Christians.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   It is the Holy Spirit who works the miracle of regeneration in the heart.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   He produces a new man.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   A man that is so different from what we were that we can scarcely recognize ourselves,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   exactly as the Apostle Paul.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   It was to these Galatians he said, "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   and the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   My dear friend, drop everything.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Realize the uselessness of everything and just as you are,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   turn to God and say, "Oh, for a heart to praise my God."
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   A heart from sin set free. Don't pray to be better.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   Pray for a new heart.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   Cry out with David in Psalm 51, "Create in me a new heart, O Lord,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   and renew a right spirit within me."
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   And that is the marvel. It's a miracle.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   It's something men can't understand. Nicodemus tried and he couldn't.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Our Lord said to him, "The wind bloweth where it listeth,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   though hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   nor whither it goeth.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit."
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   This is Christianity.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   That the Almighty God, who made the whole cosmos out of nothing at the beginning,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   takes hold upon your soul and makes it anew,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   puts a new principle of life into it, a new disposition.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   And to your own amazement and astonishment,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   you find that you're a new man.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   You seem to be in a new world.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   All things are passed away.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Behold, all things are become new.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Your circumcision was of no value.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Your own circumcision was of no value.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Nothing was of any value.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   But God has done it all. He's put life into you.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   And you've got a new start and a new outlook and a new everything.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   That's it.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   In Christ Jesus,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   but a new creature.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Can you understand yourself?
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Can you account for yourself?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Can you tell me why you are what you are?
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   If you can, you're not a Christian.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   A Christian is a man, by definition, who has been made by God,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   and he's amazed at himself.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   He's a new creature, a new creation.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Nothing that he had was of any value.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   He is what he is by the grace of God.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   And the life he now lives in the flesh,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   he lives by the faith of the Son of God,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   who loved him and gave himself for him.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Have you got the new heart?
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Have you got the new disposition?
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Do you find you have to drag yourself to worship God?
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   Do you have to drag yourself to live the Christian life?
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   If so, my friends, you'd better examine the foundations again.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   A new creature, a new creation,
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   made by God,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   after the image and the pattern of the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   but a new creature, a new creation of God.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Amen.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
