[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Okay, sounds good.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.320]   This question is from Cameron.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.280]   He's in college.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.800]   He has a question about your thoughts
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.840]   on the metaverse from Meta.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.300]   - Hi Cal, college student here.
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.640]   What are your thoughts on the metaverse
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.200]   that Meta is currently trying to build?
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.020]   How do you think that it's going to affect society?
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.860]   Thank you.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.680]   - Well, there's a few things going on here.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.960]   One, why is Facebook doing this?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.280]   And in part it's because,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.440]   as I've been predicting for a few years now,
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.800]   the age of social media monopoly platforms
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.480]   has begun its descent.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.480]   We just didn't realize it.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660]   Now we're actually starting to see it.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.760]   Facebook posted one of their first reductions
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.440]   in active user minutes,
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.800]   and their stock lost something like $150 billion.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.400]   The biggest in absolute value,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.640]   single one day drop of a company's valuation ever.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.280]   So people are leaving Facebook,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.600]   people are leaving Instagram.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.600]   This era in which there's six platforms you have to use,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.520]   but you can't communicate
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160]   and you're completely out of it.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.880]   That's all dissolving into a world
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.320]   of much more niche social media.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.140]   And I've talked about before why this has happened.
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.920]   I talked about this on Lex Fridman's podcast, for example.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.320]   I went into detail on this.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.120]   The issue is the network effect,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.300]   the main network effect that these platforms had
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.620]   that made them monopolies,
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.800]   was everyone you know is using them.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.540]   And so when their main promise was,
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.880]   you're gonna update people on what you're up to
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.160]   and see what people you know are up to,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.640]   that network effect dominates.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.140]   If I need a place to go to see what people I know are up to,
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.560]   and they're all on this one platform,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.040]   no competitor will succeed.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.400]   I have to go to Facebook.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.240]   That was the foundation
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.080]   on which they built their massive user base.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.440]   They then got spooked
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380]   because they saw Twitter come out of nowhere
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.420]   and have a lot of success
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.000]   with this algorithmic curated timeline feature.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.680]   And so the main social media companies,
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.240]   namely Facebook and Instagram,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880]   and then Facebook eventually bought Instagram,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.000]   said, well, what we're gonna do instead is,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.160]   say these platforms are not about connecting
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.000]   with people you know,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.260]   it's about distraction and entertainment.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.460]   We will select articles and posts and things
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.840]   that are generating a lot of engagement
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.900]   and we'll put them in an infinite scroll newsfeed.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.900]   And you could just click on that F on your phone
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.740]   when you're bored
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.580]   and there's gonna be something there
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.400]   that's gonna press your buttons
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.920]   and it's a good distraction.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.740]   That was the beginning of the end for these platforms.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.240]   Yes, when you already had 1.3 billion people
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.160]   on these platforms,
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.200]   they were gonna use it more in the short term
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   'cause that's more interesting
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.580]   than seeing what your cousin's up to.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.520]   But in the longterm,
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.200]   now there's no reason to be on Facebook
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.320]   if I wanna be entertained.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.460]   Yeah, that's entertaining,
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.940]   but so are podcasts.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.080]   So are shows on the streaming services.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.720]   So are books.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.700]   You know, so are any other number of other services
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.340]   where it could care less if my cousin uses it.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.020]   And that's exactly what happened to Facebook.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.600]   It's like, yes, that was more entertaining
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.660]   for their existing users,
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.620]   but over time their users were saying,
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.340]   I don't really wanna see Facebook newsfeeds.
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.400]   I wanna watch, you know, Yellowstone over on Paramount
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.740]   and listen to a podcast on some niche topic
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.060]   I'm really interested in.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.100]   This is entertaining,
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.580]   but other things are even more entertaining.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.720]   So they're starting to lose users.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.760]   And so what we get instead
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.040]   is the rise of much more fractured social media
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   where the experience is,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.880]   okay, if we're gonna do distraction,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.320]   let's just do distraction.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.160]   And that was TikTok's play.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.520]   TikTok said, okay,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.040]   if this is just about scrolling things and being distracted,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.800]   let's just plug that matrix cable
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.400]   straight into the back of your spine.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   Let's get rid of the whole,
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.200]   like my cousin's on here and I have a wall
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.020]   and I'm connecting to people.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.520]   Just get rid of all of that.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.220]   And let's just like hone in like a laser beam
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.820]   on just the absolute most in the moment,
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.540]   dopamine hijacking, attention generating style of content.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.580]   And don't even worry about where it comes from.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.740]   We'll just show you things one after another.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.740]   If that's our game here,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.980]   then let's just purify that.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.060]   And that's what TikTok is doing.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.800]   And that's why it's sort of eating the lunch
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.240]   of the other social media platforms
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.340]   because it's saying, forget this,
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.060]   like I wanna connect to people I know stuff.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.280]   However, that is a world in which the obligation
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.580]   to be on these platforms completely dissolves.
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.120]   And I don't mean to rant too much about this,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.140]   but Cameron, I think about this a lot.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.920]   Five years ago, when I would say in public,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.760]   I don't use social media, I don't use Facebook.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.440]   People were aghast.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.460]   Like this is crazy.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.640]   How can you survive in our society without it?
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.520]   That's where everyone is.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.440]   That's how you know what's going on.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.720]   That's where all the cultural trends are.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.800]   That's where all the news is.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.000]   That's how you get business.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.020]   In an age of TikTok, no one cares anymore
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.540]   if you're not using it.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.600]   'Cause it's just purified dopamine distraction.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.340]   So if you say, hey, I don't have a TikTok account.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.460]   No one's like, how do you survive?
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.340]   Like, yeah, I know it's weird.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.820]   You know, it's fun, but there's no expectation
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.140]   that you would use it.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.260]   And that's actually way more healthy relationship
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.100]   with these tools.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.900]   And so what we're gonna get is TikTok 2.0 and 3.0,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.060]   all sorts of different services
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.660]   that directly press buttons in very specific types
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.500]   of ways.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.780]   A clubhouse was like this.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.220]   It was doing something else very specific,
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.200]   was very interesting.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.220]   None of which have any network effect requirements.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.460]   I don't need my cousin and my friends from high school
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.020]   and my grandfather to be on TikTok for it to be useful.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.860]   And it's promised to me.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.680]   It's promised to me is like,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.080]   we're gonna show you these videos
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.860]   and there's gonna be a cat on it
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.940]   and it's gonna be entertaining.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.380]   And so once you got rid of the network effects,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.840]   this whole thing is just gonna fragment
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.960]   into lots of different sources of entertainment.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.540]   Some different than others, some much more base,
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.700]   some much more high end.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.820]   It doesn't matter.
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.560]   And no one will be expected to use any one of these things.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.520]   And it's not a weirdness
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.820]   if you don't use any one of these things.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.120]   And that's actually a much better, healthier world.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.660]   This more long tail niche social media type world.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.500]   It's less about connection and more about distraction
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.340]   is fine.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.260]   And that's where we're going.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.860]   And you can't be a $700 billion a year
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.540]   social media company anymore,
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.740]   once we get to that world.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.380]   And that's what Facebook sees.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.380]   And that's why they're trying to shift away from it.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.380]   All right, so that's the whole background
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.100]   for what's going on.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.140]   I think the particular meta vision that we see now,
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.900]   which tends to be focused on social life
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.500]   occurring in virtual reality, that's a smoke screen.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.720]   That's not the big headline.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.500]   The big headline with these technologies
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   is going to be the dissipation
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.580]   of the personal electronics industry.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.420]   I was talking to some people in the industry about this
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.940]   when I was doing a New Yorker piece last fall
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.860]   about people who work in virtual reality.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.060]   This Cameron is the trend that is much more powerful.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.500]   And the trend works as follows.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.540]   Once augmented reality glasses
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.700]   get to a certain level of quality,
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.980]   and once we have sufficient high speed internet
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.100]   wherever we need to be, and we're very close to that,
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.660]   there'll be no need to own any other consumer electronics
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.700]   beyond those glasses.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.120]   If I want to use a computer,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.300]   I don't buy a computer from Apple.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.260]   There is a instance in some Amazon virtualization cloud
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260]   somewhere of my computer running in a giant server farm,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.660]   and my AR glasses will create a screen
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.660]   wherever I want in the environment in front of me.
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.740]   And there is a screen of whatever size I want,
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.900]   and there I work on my computer.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.980]   If I need to use my phone,
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.420]   I do not need to own an iPhone or an Android phone.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.700]   I have my glasses on.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.420]   I can just pull my hands down
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.020]   and there is the list of my contacts
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.860]   and I can see who's texting me.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.740]   I don't need a separate phone.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.900]   If I want to watch TV, I do not need a 65 inch TV.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.560]   I can make a 65 inch TV show up wherever I want in my house,
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.180]   and it can be in a position
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.700]   where I see it through my AR goggles,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.860]   but everyone else in my house
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.300]   sees it in the exact same position.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.940]   We can't tell the difference between that screen
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.940]   being there in real life or not.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.140]   There's no need to actually buy or own TVs.
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.540]   That is the huge game changer that is coming.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.900]   The virtualization of computation into the cloud
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.180]   and the replacement of interfaces
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.040]   with augmented reality goggles.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.580]   Many companies disappear once that happens.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.600]   What's the Foxconn plant,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.820]   Apple's Foxconn plant gonna do
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.160]   when there's no iPhones to produce,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.440]   there's no iMacs to produce?
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.360]   What are they gonna do?
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.520]   You know, that's gonna go out of business.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.760]   What's Samsung gonna do
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.360]   when high-end Android phones
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.620]   and large screen TVs don't need to exist?
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.680]   It's gonna disappear.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.480]   It's gonna be a huge change
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.520]   to the digital electronics industry.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.840]   And guess what?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.320]   All of the major players are investing huge amounts of money
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.600]   to make sure that they are not going to lose
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.740]   in that game of musical chairs.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.500]   Yes, Facebook talks about META.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.940]   Facebook is also caring a lot about this future
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.040]   of virtualized consumer electronics.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.860]   They are spending a lot of money on, guess what?
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.980]   Their own pair of these augmented reality glasses.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.500]   Apple is putting a ton of money into this as well
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.300]   because it is existential for Apple.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.740]   Apple is a trillion dollar company
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.860]   that will disappear and no longer exist
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.380]   if they don't win the fight to be the people
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.820]   who produce the best glasses that virtualize all this
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.440]   because you don't produce iPhones
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.440]   in a world of augmented reality.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.560]   Amazon and Google are betting big on both.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.880]   Google is betting big on the glasses front.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.520]   They're doing that with Magic Leap,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.640]   which they put well over a billion dollars into.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.240]   Amazon is trying to be the back-end computation.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.760]   So if we don't actually have a phone,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.180]   if we don't actually have a computer,
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.600]   where does that computation happen?
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   Amazon is saying, "We'll do it.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.200]   "We're not just virtualizing computation,
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.660]   "we're virtualizing hardware.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.800]   "We can make anything you want happen in our servers
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.060]   "and we'll just beam the screen to wherever you are."
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.920]   So Cameron, that is the big trend.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.840]   That is gonna be the trend
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.240]   that's gonna completely upend our industry,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.600]   not, as Mark Zuckerberg videos would seem to imply,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.000]   us playing cards in virtual reality in a space station
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.680]   with some of our friends.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.960]   That's not that interesting to me.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.520]   The thing that's gonna upend our world
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.060]   is all interfaces are virtual.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.760]   All computation happens on Amazon servers.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.320]   And 80% of the major digital electronics company
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.440]   that exists today no longer exist in any way
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.040]   that we, anywhere like how we see them today.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.640]   That's what I would keep my eyes on,
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.900]   not being in one of these weird virtual reality
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.140]   space stations and doing Facebook with avatars
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.320]   or something like this.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.580]   Interesting stuff could happen there,
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.280]   but that's not where my eye is right now.
