[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.240]   - Welcome everyone, thanks for being here.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.920]   My name is Gauri.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.160]   I'm on the board of the Bogle Center
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.120]   for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.740]   We're happy to have you here.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.720]   We are thrilled to have Dr. Jordan Grumet
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.040]   speak about finding purpose, balance, and meaning
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.360]   during the accumulation years.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.800]   Jordan's bio is ubiquitously available,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.960]   so I'll touch on a few key points.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.120]   He's a hospice physician,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.440]   so he has unique insights into what people regret
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.600]   and don't regret.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.960]   He's authored over 1,000 blog posts,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.440]   and he's the author of this book,
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280]   "Taking Stock, A Hospice Doctor's Advice
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.880]   "on Financial Independence, Building Wealth,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.440]   "and Living a Regret-Free Life."
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200]   And he has another book on the way.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.320]   In a way, Jordan has been a physician since age seven,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   and he'll touch on that later.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.440]   Some quick housekeeping.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.640]   Folks on chairs and at your tables
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.900]   have notepaper and pens.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.120]   I'll be walking around collecting questions
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.640]   that when Jordan's done with his primary talk,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.860]   I'll collect the questions and ask them of Jordan.
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.400]   So just raise your hand, and I'll walk over to you.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.040]   With that, I'll turn it over to Jordan.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.440]   - Thank you, Gauri, for your kind introduction.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   Chris was on the cusp of his 12th birthday
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.560]   when he arguably made one of the two biggest decisions
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.040]   of his young life.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.920]   He decided to run away from his foster home.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.080]   You see, Chris's parents died when he was four years old
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.200]   when they were in an unfortunate car accident,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.520]   and he had bounced from foster home to foster home,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.960]   but this last one wasn't good, it was abusive.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.500]   So he made this huge decision, and he ran away from home.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.760]   Now, over the next year, he did whatever he could
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   to find a place to stay, shelter, and to find food.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.880]   He lied, he cheated, he stole.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.520]   He probably did a few other things
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.400]   that we're not gonna talk about here,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.520]   but it was on the cusp of his 13th birthday,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.440]   one year later, that he made even a bigger decision,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.400]   and that was not to commit suicide.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.480]   Because by that time,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.360]   he realized he couldn't go on like that anymore,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   and it was either take his own life, or...
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.960]   Or...
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.920]   The truth is, he didn't have many options,
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.320]   but one morning, he woke up on a park bench,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.480]   and another kid was lying next to him,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.520]   and that kid said, "Hey, there's this guy,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.160]   "his name is Rabbi Simon, and he has a synagogue
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.880]   "five miles from here in neighboring Waukegan, Illinois,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.800]   "and if you go there, he will give you support,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.940]   "give you food, get you some help."
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.360]   So that morning, Chris walked in his shoes,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.080]   full of holes, the five miles,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.400]   and found himself sitting in the pews of the synagogue,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.840]   waiting for Rabbi Simon to come out of his study.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.960]   And little did he know that Rabbi Simon
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.120]   was gonna come out of his study, and save his life.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.960]   And you know how I know that?
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   Because six months earlier, I saved Rabbi Simon's life,
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.960]   and 60 years before that,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.840]   a gentleman who none of us ever had met,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   saved all our lives, and he did so without knowing it,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.640]   by pursuing his unique sense of purpose.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.000]   My goal for all of you here today,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   is to do the same thing, and help you do the same thing.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.280]   So how did I get here?
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.920]   At the age of seven, my father, a physician,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.560]   a prominent oncologist, was rounding at the hospital,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.160]   got a severe headache, collapsed, and died.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.360]   He had a brain aneurysm.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.000]   He bled right there in the hospital.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.560]   And I was seven years old, and like many seven-year-olds,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.480]   I looked at life through my own lens.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.920]   Like, it's a time where we think
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.600]   everything happens because of us.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.280]   So for me, my father dying must have been my fault.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.120]   I wasn't good enough.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.880]   I wasn't compliant enough.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.440]   I wasn't lovable enough.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.240]   And so somewhere in my brain, I decided to,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.600]   the way I was gonna make up for this,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.080]   is I was gonna become a doctor just like him.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.880]   I was gonna walk in his shoes.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.680]   I was gonna do all the good
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.520]   that he never had the chance to do.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.400]   And this became my sense of purpose.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.080]   This became my identity.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.320]   And it carried me.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.960]   It carried me through a learning disability
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.920]   when I was little.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.160]   It carried me through moving from one middle school
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.520]   to a different high school.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.840]   It carried me through college
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.120]   when all of my friends were out
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.080]   at the University of Michigan football games,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.880]   and I was in the law library studying.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.480]   I became the student I had to be
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.320]   to become the doctor that I was predestined to become.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.240]   And that's exactly what I did.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.040]   But there was a problem.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.560]   After practicing for a number of years,
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.400]   I realized that this wasn't filling me up.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.760]   I was feeling exhausted and burned out
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.800]   and all the paperwork
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.860]   and not feeling like I was helping anyone.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.520]   And so I did what a lot of people do.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.000]   I said, "Well, I can't go on being a doctor,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.800]   "and I don't know how to do anything else to make money.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.040]   "So what I need to do is make as much money
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.120]   "as possible so that I can never work again
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.360]   "and leave this profession that is no longer filling me up."
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   And so I asked around.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.400]   I asked my financial advisor,
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.640]   "Well, how much money do I need?"
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.880]   And he did some kind of Monte Carlo simulation
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.320]   and told me that I needed a lot more than I needed.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.760]   He forgot to ask me how much I wanted to spend.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.400]   And then I asked my accountant, who happens to be my mom,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.080]   and I said, "How much money do I need to never work again?"
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.400]   And she said, "$10 million."
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.800]   And I said, "Okay, I don't have $10 million."
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.040]   So then I went back to work,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.600]   doing this job that wasn't filling me up.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.920]   And then in 2014, something magical happened.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.000]   I got a phone call from a guy I had never met before.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.280]   His name was Jim Dolly,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.160]   and he had written a book called "The White Coat Investor."
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   And at the time, I was writing a medical blog
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.240]   about what it felt like to be a doctor.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.880]   And I had a reasonable following,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.240]   and Jim's book was coming out,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.980]   and he wanted me to review his book for my blog.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.360]   So I read his book, and I knew immediately,
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.160]   oh my God, I'm financially independent.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.920]   You see, he gave me this vocabulary I didn't understand.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.280]   I didn't know what a safe withdrawal rate was.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.920]   And I was just so excited for a moment.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.400]   And then I had a panic attack.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.080]   Because the thing is,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.520]   I had never considered what I could be or what I would do
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.560]   if I wasn't being a doctor.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.320]   It was the singular thing
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.780]   that connected me to a father who died
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.080]   when I was a little boy.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.820]   And so I went down the rabbit hole of depression
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.820]   for about six months.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.260]   I couldn't leave being a physician,
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.220]   even though it wasn't filling me up.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.360]   I couldn't throw away the baby with the bath water.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.140]   So what I started to do
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.700]   is I started to get rid of the things
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.560]   I hated about being a doctor.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.420]   I left my private practice.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.540]   Eventually, I got rid of nights.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.620]   Then I got rid of weekends.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.820]   Then I got rid of being on call.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.980]   And then I got rid of working in nursing homes
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.180]   and what was I left with?
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.080]   Well, I had this part-time thing I did
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.940]   which really filled me up and it was hospice work.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.180]   And so I was running teams of nurses and chaplains
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.700]   and certified nursing assistants
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.420]   who were taking care of hospice patients.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.300]   And I still liked that.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.000]   And so I knew this is something I would do
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.600]   even if no one was paying me for it.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.020]   So this feels purposeful.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.100]   I'm gonna hold on to that.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.940]   But the thing is,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.980]   I was only doing it 10 or 15 hours a week.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.200]   So the big question became,
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.740]   well, who am I gonna be now?
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.700]   Now I have all this space.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.600]   What am I gonna fill my time up with?
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.580]   And I realized there were all these things that I loved
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.440]   that I never gave myself permission to pursue.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.380]   I loved writing.
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.840]   I mean, I had been writing blogs for years,
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.000]   but I never had time to do it.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.100]   It wasn't something you did for money or as a living.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.260]   It was a hobby.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.320]   So I did it during breaks during lunch
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.300]   or I did it at night when the kids were sleeping.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.000]   I loved public speaking.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.780]   I loved having these deep conversations.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.080]   So having all this time
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.620]   and finally giving myself permission
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.420]   to start being the person I wanted to be,
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.360]   not some shadow of my father,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.000]   I started to write about personal finance
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.200]   'cause that's where my brain was.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   This is the big epiphany I had.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.320]   And eventually I started a podcast.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.520]   When I did that podcast,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.320]   I had people on the show who were experts in business
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.800]   and entrepreneurs and financial independence people
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.120]   and authors.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.220]   And I found that we had these great conversations
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.120]   about how do I get rich?
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.240]   How do I make money?
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.560]   But then when we started talking about
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.620]   why am I getting rich?
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.600]   And what does living a good life look like
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.720]   after I've accumulated money?
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.360]   We didn't have any good answers.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.040]   But you know who did have answers?
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.380]   My hospice patients.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.760]   My hospice patients.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.260]   That 10 or 15 hours a week,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.200]   I was still doing hospice medicine.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.000]   I was sitting with people on their deathbeds
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.120]   and talking to them about what was important.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.680]   And you know what?
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.080]   Finding out you're gonna die in the next few weeks
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.920]   or months makes you very clear
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.800]   about what's important to you.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.160]   And so they didn't tell me I wish I worked longer.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.800]   And they didn't tell me I wish I made more money.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.200]   They told me I really regret
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.560]   that I never had the energy or courage or time to,
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.720]   and there was a big blank there
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.880]   'cause everyone had something different.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.480]   But then I started bringing those conversations
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.560]   back to the personal finance people.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.080]   Bring that back to my podcast.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.080]   When you are dying and you realize that you have regrets,
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.800]   regret is another word for disappointment
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.000]   because you don't have agency.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.920]   You can't change your life.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.560]   But what if you realize your regrets when you're young
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.160]   and you have years ahead of you?
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.860]   Well, that sounds a lot like me to purpose.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.360]   And so taking all this information,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.240]   I wrote my book, "Taking Stock."
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.360]   Everything I had learned from the dying
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.640]   about money and life.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.200]   And I went to places like this.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.760]   And I gave talks and I marketed my book
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.800]   and something happened I never expected.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.480]   At the end of a conference like this,
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.520]   I would walk out into the hallway
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.960]   and someone would come up to me
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.680]   and instead of a smile, I almost saw a growl, right?
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.160]   They kind of looked, they were sweaty,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.600]   they were a little bit angry.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.560]   And I waited patiently afraid
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.000]   of what they were about to say.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.680]   And this happened multiple times, mind you.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.200]   And they would say something to the extent of I get it.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:39.320]   You tell me that I should pursue a sense of purpose
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.920]   and then use that purpose
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.400]   to build a financial framework around me.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.340]   But I don't know what my purpose is.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.520]   And so how do I find my purpose?
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.880]   And this led to my second book, "The Purpose Code."
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.440]   And we're gonna talk a bunch about that.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.880]   But I first want to go back to my book, "Taking Stock"
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.280]   and talk about a few of the major premises around that book.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.040]   Because really they were three main premises.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.360]   The first premise was we need to start thinking
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.840]   about purpose, identity and connections
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.820]   before we build our financial framework.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.780]   So what does that mean?
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.320]   Well, let's talk about purpose.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.140]   A lot of us struggle with purpose,
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.400]   but the truth of the matter is
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.440]   I had seen it in my dying patients.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.040]   I had asked that question.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.320]   What do you really regret
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.840]   never having the energy, courage or time to do?
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.640]   And I knew for younger people,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.140]   this formed the kernel of the answer to that question.
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.320]   So next came identity.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.880]   Well, how do you know what your identity is supposed to be?
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.340]   And I always tell people we should do this basic exercise.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.940]   Ask yourself the question I am, say the statement I am,
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.040]   and then fill in the blank.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.980]   Now, the first time I did this, I said, I am.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.320]   And the first thing that came out was I am a doctor,
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.240]   which kind of makes me laugh a little bit
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.760]   'cause I don't really identify that way anymore.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.080]   After that, it got more definitional.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.800]   I am a father.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.840]   I am a son.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.680]   I'm a spouse.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.380]   All true, but not necessarily unique to me.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.200]   But eventually when I asked myself this question
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.280]   over and over again, I am,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.080]   I came up with, I'm a podcaster.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.360]   I'm a public speaker.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.800]   I'm a writer.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.520]   It all coalesced into I'm a communicator.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.360]   And I knew that this fit me
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   better than that identity of being a doctor.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.880]   It just felt right.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.320]   And so this is a real good chance for you to be aspirational.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.120]   When you say I am, it's not who you are today,
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.320]   but who do you strive to be?
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.920]   So that's purpose and identity.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.040]   The last piece was connections.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.240]   And the thing I found is that when you concentrate
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.400]   on purpose and identity, the connections naturally follow.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.160]   So I'd spent all these years trying to become a doctor,
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.040]   but that identity didn't fit my inside.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.320]   It was an identity I was trying to wear on the outside.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.740]   And so I'd hang out in doctor places, right?
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.600]   I'd go to the doctor lounge
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.940]   or I'd hang out with my doctor friends.
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.640]   And I never felt quite myself.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.560]   But when I recognized this identity of a communicator,
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.760]   a public speaker, a writer,
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.880]   and I'd go to conferences like this,
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.240]   I'd meet bloggers and podcasters
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.860]   and feel comfortable with them immediately.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.260]   As if I knew them better than I knew these doctors
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.200]   that I had known for decades.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.820]   These were my people.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.120]   So the first premise of the book
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.280]   is purpose, identity, and connections come first.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   The second premise is then we have to define a path
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.960]   towards financial independence.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.000]   Now we have an idea
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   of what purpose, identity, and connections are.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.560]   We have to build a life around that,
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.880]   build the financial life.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.360]   And if you've heard me talk about this before,
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.960]   I often talk about the path of three brothers.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.020]   This is a parable and it just explains
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.480]   some of the financial concerns
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.080]   and the ways we get to financial independence.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.140]   The eldest brother,
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.340]   this is the one who front loads the sacrifice.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.340]   If you're familiar with the traditional FIRE movement,
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.080]   financial independence, retire early.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.580]   The idea is you work really hard,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.420]   maybe at a job you don't like.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.460]   You put purpose, identity, and connections aside
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.300]   for the short term.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.180]   You accumulate tons of money
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.820]   till you get to some net worth number.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.500]   We've all talked about safe withdrawal rates
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.700]   and the 25 times rule and all this kind of stuff.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.520]   And then you retire as fast as you can
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.500]   and you live the life you wanna live.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.400]   You start thinking about purpose then.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.240]   That's path one, the eldest brother.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.320]   Path two, the middle brother,
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.460]   is more about passive income and side hustles.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.560]   Instead of waiting until you get to this large net worth,
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.960]   what if you could start some side hustles
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.920]   or get some passive income
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.040]   in such a way that you can make enough money every month
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.160]   to cover your monthly needs?
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.320]   Might take you a few years.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.720]   You might have to invest in real estate
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.800]   or become an entrepreneur.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.320]   You might have to work really hard in the beginning,
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.400]   but a few years into it,
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.040]   maybe you can cover your monthly needs
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.520]   and then you're basically financially independent
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.800]   and you have all the time in the world
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.260]   for purpose, identity, and connections.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.400]   And last but not least, finally, the third path,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.200]   the path of the youngest brother,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.800]   was the path of the passion play.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.000]   What if you find something that feels deeply purposeful
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.520]   and exciting to you and you start doing it immediately
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.760]   and you happen to make enough money
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.920]   to cover your monthly or yearly needs,
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.640]   then you're financially independent right away.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   So premise one, purpose, identity, and connections.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.200]   Premise two, defining your path to financial independence.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.600]   And finally, premise three,
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.160]   asking yourself what scares you most.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   Are you more afraid that you are going to die young
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160]   and wealthy or old and broke?
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.840]   And here's why we have to ask this question
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.240]   because none of us know when we're going to die.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.120]   If we knew when we were gonna die,
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.280]   we could set the marker for 20 years,
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.200]   six months, and three days,
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.080]   and make sure we spent our money accordingly
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.720]   so that we have exactly zero on our death date
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.600]   or whatever we wanted to pass on to our children.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.720]   But of course, we can't do that.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.520]   So we have to make our best guesstimate.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.640]   So what scares you most?
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.000]   Are you afraid that you are gonna die young and rich?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.180]   If that's the case, maybe save a little bit less
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.460]   and spend a little more.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.320]   Worst comes to worst, you're wrong
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.600]   and you live a great life
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.800]   where you're spending and enjoying yourself
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.520]   and it takes a little longer to get to retirement,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.940]   no big deal.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.780]   On the other hand,
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.520]   if you're afraid that you're gonna live long and go broke,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.400]   save a lot more and only spend maybe a little bit on YOLO.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.520]   You only live once.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.200]   It's a continuum.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.680]   The point is we can use this question to help us frame
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.040]   whether we should spend more today
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   or we should defer gratification for tomorrow.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.120]   So these were the premises of the book
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.040]   and these are the talks I gave.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.440]   And so I got that worried and anxious and angry response
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.340]   about people not knowing how to find their purpose.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.460]   And so I went and I did a deep dive on purpose.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.660]   If this is causing people so much anxiety,
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.800]   what does the scientific literature tell us about purpose?
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.040]   How do we resolve this problem
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.760]   that telling people to find a purpose
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.460]   makes them feel bad instead of good?
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.280]   Well, I found out two things.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.280]   Two things that contradict each other.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.380]   First and foremost,
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.700]   studies show that having a sense of purpose in life
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.660]   is associated with health, happiness, and longevity.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.660]   Clearly, tons of studies, very well proven.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.960]   On the other hand, then I found other studies
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.260]   that show that up to 91% of people
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.660]   at some point in their life have purpose anxiety.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.300]   This idea of purpose gives them anxiety.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.220]   They get depressed and they actually feel worse.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.900]   So this is a paradox.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.920]   How can purpose be both the most important thing to us
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.460]   and yet also be amazingly anxiety provoking?
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.980]   What I recognize from my years in hospice,
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.940]   from being a podcaster, from writing books,
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.740]   is I recognize that probably purpose is not just one thing.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.220]   It's probably at least two phenomena.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.860]   And one of those causes anxiety and makes us feel bad.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.180]   And the other probably more relates
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.020]   to health, happiness, and anxiety.
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.740]   So let's talk about those two different types of purpose.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.700]   The first one, the one that makes us anxious
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.580]   is what I call big P purpose.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.520]   Big P purpose is goal oriented.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.020]   It's very much all or nothing.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.740]   And it usually is audacious.
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.560]   I wanna be a billionaire.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.300]   I wanna become president.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.580]   I wanna travel to the moon.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.900]   These are things that most of us cannot accomplish.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.740]   Why?
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.180]   Because you have to be the right person
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.540]   at the right time, saying the right things
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.960]   with lots of luck and good genetics.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.980]   Like if I wanna be an all-star basketball player
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.180]   and I was born and I only grew to four foot 10,
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.320]   the likelihood I'm gonna be an all-star basketball player
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.760]   is just very low.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.060]   So we don't have a huge amount of agency
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:01.060]   over big P purpose and therefore it's really easy to fail.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.140]   And it's usually winner take all, right?
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.940]   If my goal is to be president,
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.880]   only one person at a time can be president,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.500]   which means everyone else fails.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.220]   So the problem with big P purpose
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.200]   is it makes us feel bad and anxious
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.560]   because often we don't have agency
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.380]   to accomplish what we're trying to do.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.160]   Contrast that to the other type of purpose,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.800]   little P purpose.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.180]   Instead of worrying about goals,
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.820]   little P purpose focuses on process.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.580]   What are the things we love to do
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.080]   regardless of the outcome?
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.900]   What do you do that lights you up?
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.460]   The great thing about little P purpose
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.540]   is it's impossible to fail.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.740]   And more importantly, when we think about big P purpose,
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.020]   it's a very scarcity mindset oriented, right?
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.480]   It's very difficult.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.520]   But little P purpose is very abundance oriented.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.920]   It's all or all.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   All you have to do is show up and you've won the game.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.120]   But here's the thing.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.920]   Even if you believe me and you're listening
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.200]   and you're saying, aha, big P purpose bad,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.840]   little P purpose good,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.400]   we still have the same problem.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.120]   Those people who came up to me at the conferences
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.300]   can say, okay, I hear your versions of purpose,
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.780]   but I still don't know how to find my purpose.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.680]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.360]   I don't think you find your purpose.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.480]   I think you build and create it.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.040]   But it is also true that you need to have
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.760]   some beckonings or inklings towards what to focus on
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.200]   to build that purpose.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.040]   And so what I call that are purpose anchors.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.600]   So the better question is how do we find our purpose anchors
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.760]   so that we can build or create this life of purpose?
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.280]   And so in my book, "The Purpose Code" that's coming out,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.160]   I talk about four or five different ones of these.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.720]   So let's talk about how you find your purpose anchors
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.200]   so you can build this life of purpose around them.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.680]   The first way is what I call the life review.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.760]   I talked about this in my first book, "Taking Stock."
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.980]   We've touched on it briefly here.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.600]   In the hospice, when we sit with a dying patient
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.560]   and we get their pain controlled
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.520]   and we get them comfortable in their house
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.180]   or the hospital, wherever they are,
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.640]   we do something called the life review.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.220]   It's a series of structured questions to ask them
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.920]   what were the most important moments?
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.320]   What were their biggest successes?
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.560]   What were their biggest failures?
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.680]   What were their regrets?
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.960]   This is really an attempt for them to review their life.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.080]   And as I was talking about before,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.720]   if we can start doing these life reviews in younger people,
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.080]   you can go to Google and search hospice life review
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.580]   and you'll get a whole series of questions.
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.680]   You can start thinking about regrets now
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.360]   and regret minimization
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.080]   and also start to turn that regret into purpose.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.400]   So life review is a really good way
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.880]   to start thinking about finding those purpose anchors.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.400]   What's another way?
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.100]   I often tell people to use what I call
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.280]   the art of subtraction.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.720]   And this is exactly what I did in my job as a doctor.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   When I realized I was financially independent,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.300]   there was so much I didn't like about the job.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.180]   So I started subtracting things out.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.240]   I got rid of nights and weekends and on-call
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.360]   and got rid of all the things I didn't like.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.440]   And what I was left with, which was hospice work,
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.960]   and I love the hospice work,
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.760]   so I knew that this was a purpose anchor.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.520]   Many of you could do the same with your jobs.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.760]   Even if you hate your jobs,
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.400]   there's probably a piece or a part of your job,
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.360]   a certain task that you love.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.680]   Using the art of subtraction,
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.360]   you can start identifying what you do like about your job,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.800]   even if it's something you only spend
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.520]   a little bit of your time doing
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.780]   and use that as a purpose anchor.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.980]   So what are some of the other ways to find purpose anchors?
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.940]   I tell people to go back to the joys of childhood.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.960]   Many of us had things we loved when we were kids
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.660]   and we grew out of them.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.160]   So if you went back to your childhood bedroom
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.440]   and looked at the posters and the awards and trophies
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.020]   and the drawings, what would they show?
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.040]   It's funny because when we're really little,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.880]   the adults around us support this.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.520]   So if you are three years old and you go to your parents,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.880]   you go to your mom and say, "Hey, mom,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.760]   "I wanna build a swimming pool in the backyard."
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.060]   What will they do?
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.040]   They will take you outside and you will play all day
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.380]   and giggle the day away and have a blast.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.720]   If you do the same thing at the age of 12,
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.560]   your parents will tell you about all the reasons
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.240]   you can't do it, why it wouldn't be up to code,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.960]   why the soil in the backyard wouldn't support it,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.360]   how you wouldn't have the time
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.240]   to have someone be a lifeguard.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.200]   They'll come up with every reason it doesn't work
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.540]   and society does that to us.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.520]   At some point, we switch from doing things we love
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.000]   because kids understand purpose
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.960]   and we start doing what we're supposed to.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.240]   We're supposed to get a job,
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.480]   we're supposed to be professionals,
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.800]   we're supposed to make lots of money.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.120]   So a good way to start thinking about your purpose anchors
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.720]   is to go back to your joys of childhood
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.120]   and start thinking about what lit you up then.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.560]   And last but not least, another technique
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.040]   and one of the last I wanna talk about
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.360]   is the spaghetti method.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.600]   So let's say you're doing all this,
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.180]   you're using the art of subtraction,
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.440]   you're doing your life review,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.100]   you're thinking about the joys of childhood
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.960]   and you still can't come up with something
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.260]   that feels purposeful for you,
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.480]   then use the spaghetti method.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.960]   Throw a bunch of stuff up against the wall
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.580]   and see what sticks.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.440]   This means say yes to activities
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.000]   you don't normally say yes to.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.640]   Hang out with people you don't normally hang out with.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.660]   Do things you don't normally do.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.960]   And by doing that,
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.360]   you're opening yourself up to experiencing new things
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.520]   and some of them may be joyful and if they are,
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.920]   that's a beautiful place to start building a life of purpose
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.220]   around some of those things.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:39.820]   So that's how you start finding purpose anchors
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.540]   and build a life of purpose around you.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.280]   Now I imagine many of you here listening
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.780]   and you're saying, okay, all of this sounds great
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.400]   but what about legacy?
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.840]   What about impact?
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.200]   What about changing the world?
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.160]   So let me tell you about my maternal grandfather.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:07.320]   My maternal grandfather died years before I was born
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.720]   and he loved math.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.680]   His little P purpose was math
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.980]   and because he loved math so much, he became a CPA.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.160]   And back in the 1950s when my mom was a little girl,
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.680]   she would sit on his lap
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.280]   and he would have his spreadsheets out
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.900]   because right back then there was no computers.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.720]   They were literally spreadsheets and you had a pencil
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.160]   and you had to write everything in the boxes
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.160]   and he would explain to her what went into all the boxes.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:40.840]   Now my mom saw her father lit up and excited
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.880]   and so she did what little kids do.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.640]   She said, hmm, that's an interesting identity.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.000]   Maybe I'll try on that identity for myself
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and see if it fits.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.900]   And she did and she found that she loved math too.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.120]   So guess what?
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.940]   My mom became a CPA.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.240]   And when I was a kid, I tried on that identity
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.520]   and decided I liked math too and this was critical
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.140]   because right around the time my father died,
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.980]   I was diagnosed with a learning disability
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.100]   and I couldn't read.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.680]   All my peers were starting on their beginning readers.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.440]   There were all these reading groups
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.040]   and I was literally coloring in a coloring book
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   and I would have thought I was dumb
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.920]   but there was one thing, one saving grace.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.180]   See, I was good at math
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.520]   and so I might have been in the lowest reading group
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.480]   but I was in the top math group.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.360]   And so this gave me the confidence and courage
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.600]   to realize if I could figure out math,
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.700]   I could figure out reading.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.540]   So I got a bunch of tutors, eventually did.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.380]   And if you think about it, I didn't become a CPA like my mom
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.740]   but I went into a highly mathematical field
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.460]   which is medicine and eventually I left medicine
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.880]   to do the financial independence movement
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.800]   to become a personal finance person
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.120]   but understanding that math was critical
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.100]   to figuring out my finances.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.700]   But it really hit home one day
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.100]   when I was in the hospital and I was seeing a patient
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.840]   and this guy kept on getting readmitted over and over again.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.580]   He was getting readmitted and he was totally dehydrated.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.120]   He was on death's doorstep and it kept happening.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.340]   And when I met him for the first time in the hospital,
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.560]   I took a look at his labs
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.660]   and I noticed a mathematical relationship
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.120]   between two of his lab results.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.760]   And it clicked in my brain because I loved math.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.100]   And I realized that he had a rare disease,
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.340]   a disease that was actually fairly treatable
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.100]   and we put him on a medicine
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.980]   and he never got readmitted to the hospital again.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.400]   And you know what his name was?
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.580]   It was Rabbi Simon.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.900]   And Rabbi Simon eventually helped Chris.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.380]   And so if you think about it,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.860]   like a rock dropped into the ocean,
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.020]   a little bit of water was displaced
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.140]   by my maternal grandfather.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.820]   And over the years, that displacement grew,
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.500]   added on to other waves and became really big at times.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.940]   And then at other times it split
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.100]   into a bunch of smaller waves.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.700]   And decades and decades later,
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.060]   hundreds of miles away,
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:23.060]   those waves are still reaching the beach
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.900]   and changing people's lives.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.220]   And so my goal for all of you
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.900]   is to develop a sense of little p purpose.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.980]   My goal is for that little p purpose
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.180]   to cause you to change the people around you.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:46.580]   My goal is that you all will create an impact
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.580]   and a legacy that endures far past your lifespans.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:59.560]   In closing, my maternal grandfather's name is Morris Adler.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.660]   It's probably the first time
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.940]   anyone has said his name this year.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.140]   He died in the 1960s.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.500]   I was born in 1973.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.620]   And one of you hearing these stories right now
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.620]   will go out and change your lives.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.060]   And Morris Adler's legacy will live.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.420]   And so can yours.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.480]   Thank you.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.640]   (audience applauding)
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.640]   - Thank you.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:42.400]   Thank you, Jordan, for sharing your insights.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.320]   Again, Christine and I are walking around
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.240]   collecting questions that you've written.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.640]   Feel free to raise your hand, we'll walk over.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.360]   So some of the questions, Jordan.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.720]   What one question from the Hospice Life Review
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.080]   do you think is most helpful for finding a purpose anchor?
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.600]   - So Hospice Life Reviews,
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.120]   there are literally 20, 30 questions.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.400]   It goes through childhood and young adulthood
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.880]   and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   But the one sentencer is if I were to find out tomorrow
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.260]   that I was gonna die within weeks,
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.680]   what would I always regret
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.540]   never having the energy, courage, or time to do?
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.840]   So it's really the regret question.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.480]   And again, I wanna encourage all of you
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.880]   to turn the concept of regret around into purpose.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.120]   Regret and people who have agency and time
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.100]   is deeply purposeful.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.400]   - Well, and thank you.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.800]   So a followup, can you share some of the most surprising
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.560]   regrets you've heard, both good and bad?
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.960]   - You know, it's funny because regret
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.040]   is so variable on the person.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.320]   So I give you that question.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.280]   What would you regret never having the energy,
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.240]   courage, or time to do?
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.440]   But the way everyone answers that is so individualized.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.000]   So for me, I had to face that question myself.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.280]   And I knew, and I always knew this,
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.400]   but never would admit to it until I did,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.440]   is I would have regret not having written a book
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.080]   and published it professionally
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.480]   'cause I didn't wanna just self-publish it.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.720]   I wanted to traditionally publish it.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.920]   So that was for me.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.680]   For other people, it really spans.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.240]   For some people, it's a hobby.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.800]   It's like, I'm pissed off I never got that 1950 Chevy
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.200]   and fixed it up and spent the summer
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.000]   enjoying myself driving it around.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.320]   For other people, it's relationships.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.080]   I regret that I never fixed that relationship
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.320]   that went awry.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.400]   Sometimes it's big.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.000]   I wish I wasn't so afraid that I didn't go
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.080]   and try to climb Mount Everest.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.340]   The answers are incredibly varied.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.640]   And the thing is, they're incredibly personal.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.240]   We have a problem here in the United States.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.800]   We are sold a vision of purpose,
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.660]   and usually it's sold to us by two different groups.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.600]   One is influencers, and the other is marketers.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.840]   And the problem with both influencers and marketers
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.640]   is they're trying to sell us something.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.720]   They're trying to tell you you need six-pack abs,
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.040]   or you need to travel the world,
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.800]   or you have to wear designer clothes,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.380]   or whatever it is, because they wanna make money on you.
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.660]   The problem, however, is that a lot of times
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.700]   it's easier for us to eclipse
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.640]   and to take on other people's sense of purpose
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.240]   than to actually build our own.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.580]   But I would guess every single person here,
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.900]   in their heart of hearts,
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.240]   if they were to close their eyes and really think about it,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.460]   understands what burning wish and desire
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.420]   they really have on the inside,
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.020]   what they really wanna do with themselves,
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.020]   who they really wanna be.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.040]   And a lot of us are just incredibly afraid to face that.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.640]   My message to you is you will regret that
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.580]   if you don't, at some point,
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.480]   try to think about who you really wanna be in this world.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.140]   But the amazing thing is the way you become that person
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.280]   is by doing the thing.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.200]   It's not by buying the thing, it's by doing the thing.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.180]   The way you become a writer is you write,
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.680]   whether you're successful or you quote-unquote fail.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.720]   It's not about the goal, it's about the process.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.840]   The way you become the best you
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.720]   is to do the thing you wanna do
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.960]   and be deeply engaged in the process.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.040]   And it almost always comes out right.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.460]   - So Lynn, thank you.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.300]   Changing topics,
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.280]   and this doesn't seem to get enough coverage.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.000]   How should folks consider preparing for cognitive decline?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   - Here's the thing.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.980]   Cognitive decline happens.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.840]   I mean, I'm 51 and I can already tell
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.280]   I can't do things the way I could do them.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.520]   I love math, but my ability to do math in my head
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.600]   is much worse than it was before.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.560]   So cognitive decline is continuous.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.080]   I don't think besides staying healthy, right?
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.060]   Eating well, exercising, not smoking,
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.480]   taking care of yourself, all the basics, right?
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.340]   It's about all we can do to help with cognitive decline.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.600]   Keeping our brains engaged, being happy,
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.040]   experiencing love, like all the good, easy stuff.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.360]   I think the caveat is that
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.520]   since we can't fix cognitive decline,
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.080]   we can surround ourselves with people
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.160]   who know who we are and what we value
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.140]   and will make good decisions for us
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.240]   if we're not able to make those decisions.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.180]   Because ultimately,
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:28.040]   if we ever get to the point
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.920]   where we can't make those good decisions,
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.780]   we want other people to make decisions
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.140]   that reflect the dignity of who we are.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.320]   And so I think the best thing we can do
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.240]   is have those conversations with our loved ones,
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.080]   show them our sense of purpose
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.480]   and who we are and what our intentions are,
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.760]   and make sure they know
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.720]   that if they ever have to make decisions for us,
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.760]   they can use those intentions
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.720]   so we can experience dignity
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.560]   even when, unfortunately, cognitively,
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.280]   we don't necessarily have that option.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.600]   - Thank you.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.120]   From your experience,
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.480]   what little-p purposes do people arrive at?
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.720]   Why are they so compelling?
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.080]   And how often should we reevaluate our little-p purpose?
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.220]   - So here's the idea.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.280]   You're born, you die,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.640]   and you have a certain amount of time.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.140]   And no matter what you do,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.280]   you have zero control over the time.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.600]   You can't buy it, you can't sell it,
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.680]   you can't exchange it.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.120]   It just exists and passes.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.480]   So what can you do?
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.800]   You can fill up that time
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.960]   with as much purposeful activity as possible
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.380]   and get rid of as many things you loathe as possible.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.460]   So why am I bringing this up?
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.800]   The truth of the matter is purpose can be anything.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.300]   All it has to do is light you up.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.160]   It can be short-term or long-term.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.400]   It can change the world,
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.340]   but it certainly doesn't have to.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.280]   Little-p purpose can be anything that lights you up.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.040]   So I don't think it matters
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.660]   what you decide your little-p purpose is,
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.560]   and I don't think it matters
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.640]   if you do it for a week or a year or a month.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.320]   That's completely up to you.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.600]   But we should always reevaluate it continuously
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.540]   because, again, winning the game
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.260]   is filling up your time with as much purposeful activity
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.520]   that connects you to other people as possible.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.780]   And to do that,
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.680]   you're always gonna be having to use certain levers, right?
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.400]   We have the joy of addition.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.200]   You can add in something purposeful to your life.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.220]   The art of subtraction,
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.600]   you can get rid of something
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.100]   that you loathe or don't like,
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.600]   or substitution, which means if you are stuck
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.040]   and you can't add or subtract, can you substitute?
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.640]   Can you change one job for another?
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.420]   Can you change one boss for another?
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.060]   Can you change one location for another?
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.400]   That's all substitution.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.440]   And so those are our levers.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.920]   We also have a bunch of tools that help us do this, right?
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.920]   Money is a great tool.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.100]   We like to talk about money.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.680]   We think money is the only tool, but it isn't.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:48.620]   Our relationships, our communities, our energy,
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.420]   our passions, our skills,
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.340]   those are also tools that we can use
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.640]   along with these levers
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   to start creating the life we wanna live now
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.360]   and not waiting to your financially independent
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.700]   and not waiting to your retired.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.600]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.680]   Building on that, studies show that nowadays
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.400]   it's becoming more challenging for younger generations
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.480]   to realize the American dream.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.160]   The net worth target has been raised to $4 million.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.840]   Do you have any good practical advice for young people
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.520]   they have a higher bar to pass
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.280]   than their parents or grandparents?
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.340]   - So here's the deal.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.000]   I hear you.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.300]   And we love to think the American dream is a net worth,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.900]   but I don't believe it for one second.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.460]   Does money buy happiness?
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.580]   Everyone points to a series of studies, right?
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.100]   The Kahneman and Deaton study, the Killingsworth study.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.340]   We could go through them if you want.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.260]   Suggestion that past $70,000 back in 2010 or whatever
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.020]   didn't get you increased happiness.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.140]   Then Killingsworth said, no, maybe it does.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.900]   There were some caveats there.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.260]   If you look at all those studies,
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.180]   a lot of them use data that was already collected,
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.860]   not for that purpose,
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.900]   or use data that was based on like texting someone
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.540]   multiple times a day for multiple weeks.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.220]   A lot of times they assessed someone's income only once
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.220]   or someone's net worth.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.500]   If you really want to answer that question,
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.620]   I suggest you look up the Harvard Adult Health Study
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.460]   or excuse me, Harvard Adult Development Study.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.820]   I always get the name wrong.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.220]   Basically this studied people for 70 or 80 years.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.920]   It originally started with Harvard students.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.940]   Eventually they brought in like a thousand,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.380]   2,000 other family members.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.580]   Then they brought in controls from the Boston area.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.380]   But what they did is they interviewed these people
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.100]   every two years.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.260]   They did physical exams.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.660]   Eventually they did MRIs and EEGs.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.620]   They questioned their family members.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.820]   And after 80 years of continuous research
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.180]   on the same people looking at happiness,
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.180]   looking at income, looking at their activities,
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.780]   they found that one thing
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.780]   was majorly associated with happiness.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.860]   And it wasn't money and it wasn't position
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.180]   and it wasn't your job.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.740]   And I'm going to spoil it here.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.580]   It wasn't even purpose.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.620]   It was interpersonal connections.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.580]   Interpersonal connections.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.460]   So if you want to think that some net worth
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.060]   is going to bring you the American dream, it isn't.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.660]   It's who you love and who loves you.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.900]   That's basically the American dream.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.580]   We can put some kind of net worth number on it.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.740]   And yes, I said that purpose doesn't
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.180]   actually make you happy.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.180]   Here's the thing.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.740]   Little p purpose causes you to build communities
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.340]   and communities are just another way
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.260]   of saying interpersonal connection.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.220]   And so I think little p purpose is a great vehicle
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.580]   towards interpersonal connection.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.300]   And I think that's why
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.180]   we should pursue that kind of purpose.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.140]   And so I can go over all sorts of more data.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.660]   There's something called the Easterlin paradox,
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.060]   which basically shows that if you take underserved areas,
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.220]   people who have no money,
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.580]   and you give them all money,
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.980]   their happiness increases briefly
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.900]   and then falls back down.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.460]   But if you take a small group of people,
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.620]   give them money and then give everyone else nothing,
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.820]   their happiness shoots up.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.780]   So it's actually more comparative
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.820]   even than the money itself.
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.540]   So I get it.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.540]   We wanna have money,
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.500]   we wanna have safety,
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.820]   we wanna have security.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.180]   The only thing I can promise you from my own experiences
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.580]   are those are not gonna be the things
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.980]   you think about on your deathbed.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.060]   - Excellent, thank you.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.700]   This may be our last question given time.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.220]   Some of what you spoke about
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.780]   only comes with time and experience and reflection.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.140]   How do we improve our capability
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.100]   and receptivity to such wisdom
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.220]   that otherwise only comes with time and experience,
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.740]   decades of time and experience?
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.420]   - So let me answer this by a roundabout way.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.500]   Leif Dahlin gave us talk yesterday
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.500]   and he mentioned this idea
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.260]   that happiness is meaning plus purpose.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.540]   So a lot of people don't know the difference
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.980]   between meaning and purpose.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.460]   In my opinion, meaning is about the past
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.300]   and it's about how we think about the past.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.100]   It's the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.780]   Happy people tend to tell themselves hero stories
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.580]   where unhappy people tend to tell themselves victim stories.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.740]   Purpose, on the other hand,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.260]   is all about the present and future
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.860]   and it's about action.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.260]   To be happy, we need both.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.380]   We need to have a great sense of meaning
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.180]   so we tell ourself a hero story
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.140]   so that we can move into the present and future
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.900]   and believe that things will go well
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.820]   and we're gonna be okay.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.780]   And so what you're talking about here with that question
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.580]   is about experiences and growing older
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.300]   and getting smarter as we grow old.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.540]   If I could leave you with one concept,
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.340]   if you wanna be a happier person,
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.020]   if you wanna find pursuing purpose easier,
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.060]   tell yourself better stories about yourself.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.580]   It's about the past.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.300]   Your ability to function in the present and the future
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.100]   is all about your past.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.500]   Develop a better sense of meaning
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   and it will serve you whether you are 25 years old
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.420]   or 45 years old or 85 years old.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.820]   - Wonderful, thank you.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.860]   Any other questions from the audience?
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:55.540]   Okay, we're set.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.540]   Thank you, Jordan.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.380]   - Thank you so much.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.540]   (audience applauding)
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.600]   you
