[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   And Rick had 35 years as a financial advisor.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.520]   He is a recognized champion for low investment fees.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.440]   I view him as the Jack Bogle heir apparent in a lot of ways.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.880]   But he's a pioneer in low-fee investment advice and portfolio management.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.640]   He's authored seven investment books,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.080]   hundreds of articles, been published all over the place.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.920]   He's got a Master of Science in Finance from Walsh College.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.960]   He's also a CFA charter holder and he's a marine.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.600]   There's no such thing as a retired marine or an ex-marine.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560]   He's a marine. He flew jets for the Marines for 21 years.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.960]   >> Thank you. Me, the case against factor investing.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.520]   Okay. I was asked to do this.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.560]   And I told Paul, I don't really need 20 minutes, probably five.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.680]   So here we go. Okay.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.040]   Now, I'm going to describe what I put up here next.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.840]   So the bullet points will come up and then I'm going to talk about them.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.400]   So you don't really have to look at them on the screen.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.160]   But here's the reality.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.400]   And that is, number one,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.240]   this is just some basic stuff about the markets and the stock market.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.720]   Market beta, the return of the entire market,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.840]   explains most of the return of every diversified portfolio.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.400]   There've been several studies on this, several famous studies.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   Eighty percent of the return of your diversified portfolio of stock.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.120]   And they use stock portfolios,
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.760]   the academics that did this, 100 stocks in each portfolio.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.480]   So just mixed them all up,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.080]   individually selected 100 stocks,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.840]   50,000 tests of this.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.400]   The bottom line is,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.200]   80 percent of the return or the variability of
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.400]   any of those portfolios was based on the return of the market.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.840]   So it doesn't matter how much small value,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.640]   large growth, whatever you put in your portfolio,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.840]   beta, or the return of the market,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.680]   is going to drive more actually than 80 percent of your stock return.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   Whether it's small value or large cap,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.520]   or small cap or value or whatever,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.560]   is going to drive a small portion of it.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.880]   These things are called factors.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.240]   And Gene Fama, Nobel Prize Laureate Gene Fama,
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.080]   I interviewed him for a blog one time,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.120]   and he called them additional factors.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.520]   And what that meant is that in addition to the 80 percent
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.600]   that explains the return of any portfolio,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.720]   any diversified stock portfolio,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.760]   about 20 percent or less will be explained by these other factors.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.840]   And that is the amount of stock in that portfolio
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.760]   that is small relative to the market,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.840]   the amount in that portfolio which has more value stocks relative to the market,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.240]   the amount in that portfolio that has more quality stocks,
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.560]   price momentum stocks relative to the market,
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.600]   is going to explain a very small portion
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.080]   of the return of the variability of those portfolios.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.040]   Those are called additional factors.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.800]   Now, some people call it smart beta.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.040]   I mean, there's a lot of marketing terms for this.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.400]   That makes up the rest of the portfolio.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.280]   So in the end, what is going to drive your portfolio return is beta.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.880]   Beta is driving your return, and factor investing is sort of,
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.520]   I don't know, the color of the flavor of the sprinkles
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.560]   that you put on your ice cream, okay?
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.320]   Now, most of the weight to additional factors,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.000]   this will determine what's called the tracking error,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.520]   the tracking error of your portfolio to the market.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.440]   So if you have more value stocks, you have more quality stocks,
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.840]   you have more momentum stocks,
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.600]   you have more of these factors in your portfolio,
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.040]   the return will track the return of the market,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.880]   but it might be more, which is the premium that Paul is hoping for,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.160]   or it could be less, and that's a negative tracking error,
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.720]   which was what we've seen for the past almost 20 years,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.080]   negative tracking error.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.240]   So a factor-tilted portfolio,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.600]   so what I'm doing here is I'm going over some semantics.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.520]   The factor-tilted portfolio means you are starting
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.200]   with the base portfolio of the market,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.360]   a total stock market index fund.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.200]   I know all the poor old slides were talking about the S&P 500
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.720]   versus small value and all that.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.600]   That's great for the presentation that he made,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.760]   but I don't start with that.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   I start with the Vanguard total stock market index fund,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.160]   which has small value in it, and it has everything else.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.480]   So you're going to get a factor-tilted portfolio.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.800]   You start with a total stock market,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.960]   and then you decide how much load you want to add to it,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.320]   to small cap, how much to add extra value,
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.240]   how much to add in momentum stocks,
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.920]   how much to add in quality stocks,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.760]   these other additional factors,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.720]   and then that will determine your tracking error
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.000]   to the market over the long term, that other 18%.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.320]   So now, the presumption with Paul's slides that go all the
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.400]   way back to 1926, which I'm sure
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.160]   that you were all investing since then,
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.680]   the factor premiums have been positive.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.000]   I'm not going to argue with math that Paul put up there
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.360]   as far as the factor premiums.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.400]   I will say that if you looked at the slide
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.320]   where he showed the factor premium,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.040]   which was one of his first slides,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   it took large cap value minus small cap value.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.000]   In other words, it's a long-short strategy, long-short.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.760]   So you're going to go long, say, large cap growth stocks
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.160]   and short, small cap growth stocks
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.080]   to find out what the premium is on small cap growth.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.360]   You go long, large cap value versus small,
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.960]   minus small cap value.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.480]   So you get, it's a long-short strategy.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.760]   So really, if you're just going long,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.520]   if you're just a long-only investor,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.360]   you got to cut everything in half.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.160]   In fact, it's less than half.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.960]   I talked to Wes Gray, who has a PhD
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.440]   from the University of Chicago,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.520]   and the upside premium is actually less
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.360]   than the downside premium.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.880]   But anyway, I don't want to get into the math of it too much.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.080]   The bottom line is, if you invest in these factors
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   and that premium is not positive, it's less than zero,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.280]   then you're going to have negative tracking error
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.120]   to the market.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.960]   Your portfolio will underperform
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.560]   the total stock market index fund.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.080]   It will, which is what we've seen for a long time.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.800]   So the only way that you could make money
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.480]   using a tilted strategy is to be in it long enough,
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.920]   and Paul said 17 years.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.480]   Wes Gray and I discussed this,
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.080]   and it's more like 25 years.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.120]   You have to be committed to a factor-tilted portfolio
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.120]   for probably 25 years to have a fairly high probability
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.320]   that you will actually get the factor premiums.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.200]   Takes that long.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.200]   And if you are going to commit
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.440]   to that 25-year period of time,
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.560]   and you want to do this strategy,
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.520]   okay, it's not gonna make that much difference,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.960]   but if this is what you want to do,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.800]   you have to stay for the long term.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.200]   You gotta get over that, what's called the hurdle rate,
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   and the hurdle rate, by the time you have to,
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.720]   I'm sorry about that, one second.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.240]   You gotta get over the hurdle rate
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.720]   of the underperformance and the fees.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.480]   By the way, small cap value, everything else,
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.340]   beta is free.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.480]   You can go out and you can buy beta,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.760]   the total stock market index fund.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.360]   I don't know if you've done a comparison
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.520]   of the total stock market index fund return
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.660]   that Vanguard has to the total stock market index,
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.880]   but they do a few things in the portfolio
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.040]   that I'll be talking about tomorrow with Jerry O'Reilly,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.880]   who's the portfolio manager of that fund,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.360]   that actually makes up a few basis points
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.800]   in the total stock market index fund
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.120]   where you are actually getting
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.760]   the return of the total stock market, even net of fees.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.120]   So beta is free.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.000]   Factor investing is not free.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.880]   You will pay fees.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.020]   The fees have come down.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.720]   You can get a small cap value fund relatively cheap.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.840]   Problem is it doesn't have high loadings
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.840]   to small cap value, 'cause the cheaper you get,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.560]   it seems like the less the loadings to the value are.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.000]   In other words, loadings are how much of that fund
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.640]   is allocated to small cap value
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.000]   and how much is allocated to maybe mid cap,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.400]   mid cap value and so forth,
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.900]   which is a little bit diluted.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.280]   And so you get something like a Vanguard
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.900]   small cap value fund, it tends to be lower fee,
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.900]   but it's also not high loadings to value factors.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:13.360]   I know we're talking, but this is the advanced group, right?
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.200]   Right, okay.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.920]   Anyway, okay, 501, this is 501.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.320]   Now you can then say, well, okay,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.300]   I want to look at these small cap value funds
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.560]   based on a different metric,
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.200]   and that is my cost per unit of risk.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.160]   And when I'm talking about risk,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.560]   I'm not talking about beta, you X that out.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.760]   I'm talking about what does it cost me
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.220]   to get the exposures to small cap and small cap value?
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.720]   Is it a very deep small cap value fund?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.760]   It's probably better if you're actually gonna do that,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.280]   better to have that fund,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.960]   because you'll find that when you look at the fees,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.760]   they're not that much higher than the less potent,
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.520]   if you will, Vanguard fund.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.360]   So the cost per unit of risk
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.400]   for the more potent fund would be better.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   So I'm just saying that if I was gonna do small cap value,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.160]   I would buy the most potent small cap value fund
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.040]   I could find, even though the fee
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.920]   is gonna be a little bit higher.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.640]   But the point is, there's always fees.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.900]   25 basis points, 30, 35, a lot higher than the total market.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.980]   That's the hurdle rate you have to get over.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.000]   You have to make that up before you're gonna outperform,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.080]   and if you don't make that up,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.640]   then you're gonna underperform.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.320]   And how have we done?
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.280]   All right, this seems to be a real interesting thing,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.240]   phenomenon that happens in the academic world.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.680]   It's that when academics come out with a new study,
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.560]   and it gets published, and you find out
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.360]   that small cap stocks back in 1980,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.900]   the study that was done in 1980,
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.920]   small cap stocks outperformed large cap stocks.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.760]   Wow, that was published, all of it,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.800]   and by the way, at the same time,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.920]   small cap mutual funds started to become very, very popular.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.760]   Lots of people investing in small cap.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.840]   What happened?
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.060]   Since 1980, no more premium, no more premium.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.600]   Okay, what about value versus growth?
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.720]   Now, there's a million different ways
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   in which you could do value.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.440]   Like Paul said, there's different value indexes.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.520]   That's true, value is in the eyes of the holder.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.320]   You could use price to book, price to sales,
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.520]   return on equity, enterprise value, on and on and on,
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.400]   a million different ways
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.640]   in which you could create a value fund.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   So value is in the eyes of the beholder.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.600]   How have value stocks done relative to growth stocks
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.640]   since the big study on this came out
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.640]   in basically the early 1990s, the Palmer French study?
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.680]   And the answer is, not that great.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.640]   What's going on?
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.340]   Are the academics wrong on this stuff?
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.000]   No, they're smart people, very smart people.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.320]   They went back into the data
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.520]   and they dug out all this information
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.820]   and they said, if you were doing this back in the day,
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.320]   you would have achieved higher rates of return.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.960]   Larry has this great book and Larry and I
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.320]   discuss a lot of things.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.320]   And, but I mean, he's a really a fine researcher himself
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.680]   and he wrote this book called,
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.520]   co-wrote it with,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.160]   Your Complete Guide to Factor-Based Investing.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.000]   It's a great book.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.160]   I really like his, this book.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.460]   It's very good.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.460]   And Larry has a library of over 3,000 different articles
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.380]   that were, or studies also that were done
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.600]   on factor investing, the so-called Factors Zoo.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.440]   The Factors Zoo.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.840]   There's literally 300 different factors
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.680]   that make up that 18%.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.840]   They call it the Factors Zoo.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.240]   In his book, he cites 106 of these different factors.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.080]   Oh, they're out there.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.960]   You can go back test to your eyes water.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   You know, you can find all these things in,
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.000]   back in history before people knew about it.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.200]   And you could create a study and say,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.280]   you know, if you actually did this,
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.180]   you know, you would have outperformed.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.840]   So, you know, are the academics wrong?
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.440]   No, they're not wrong.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.800]   They're very good at going back and looking at past data.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.200]   Very good.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.040]   What is the problem?
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.440]   Anybody ever see this photo?
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.300]   This is amazing photo.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.320]   That is Leonardo da Vinci and Mona Lisa.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.820]   This photo was taken in Florence in 1504.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.960]   What are you laughing for?
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.000]   What's wrong with it?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.340]   It didn't exist.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.480]   Of course, cameras weren't invented until the early 1800s.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.020]   So how could this photo exist?
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.840]   It was back tested.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.440]   It's a hypothetical photo.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.200]   But I bet if there actually were photographers
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.160]   back in 1504, that that picture
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.480]   probably wouldn't have been taken
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.160]   because Mona Lisa and that whole thing
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.840]   wasn't even popular back then.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.240]   So in other words, same thing with back testing.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.920]   If you would have known,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.000]   if you would have known that these things
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.760]   actually were gonna perform like Paul said,
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.200]   would it have changed the world?
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   The answer is yes.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.700]   Of course it would have.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.640]   If people actually knew that small cap
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.920]   is gonna outperform large cap,
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.120]   they would have invested in small cap.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.080]   These institutional managers have to perform.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.300]   It's their job.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.840]   If they knew that value was gonna outperform growth,
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.400]   of course they would have invested in it.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.780]   What would that have actually done to the real world data?
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.220]   It would have changed it.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.920]   We in a period now where since all this academic information
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.280]   is now out there, that maybe the world has changed.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.080]   Maybe we're not gonna see these premiums going forward.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.300]   Something you're gonna have to decide.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:43.320]   But there's another issue besides the data
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.760]   and that is behavior, us, our bad behavior.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:54.800]   So factor tilts create what I call a behavioral risk.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.280]   It's a behavioral risk that occurs
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.080]   when you're not holding the stock market.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.560]   You're not holding the market.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.120]   You're holding something else.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.600]   Why are you holding that other thing?
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.060]   Why are you not holding the market?
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.800]   'Cause you want to outperform.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.160]   You wanna beat the market.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.380]   That's why you're investing in factor funds.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.980]   How long will you last?
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.980]   That's the question.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:29.320]   From 2000 to 2007, after the tech stock bubble exploded,
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.960]   small cap value stocks had their best run,
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.040]   I think, ever, and Paul, you can correct me on this.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.880]   I was in the money management business at the time.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.840]   I had a money management shop.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.280]   I got hundreds of phone calls from people.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.400]   How do I get DFA funds?
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.680]   How do I get DFA funds?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.520]   Will you put me in a portfolio with DFA funds?
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.960]   Everybody wanted DFA funds
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   because they were the ultimate farmer,
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.640]   French three-factor model,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.640]   small cap value investment management firm at the time,
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.040]   and everybody wanted access.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.120]   And the only way you could get access to DFA funds
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.000]   at the time was to go through an advisor,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.800]   and most of the advisors were charging 1% or more
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.400]   to have that access.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.600]   So I was getting these calls all the time,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.400]   and I said, "No, we're not gonna do that.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.800]   "We really don't believe that.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.740]   "We can put a small amount in,
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.220]   "but we may not even use DFA.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.280]   "We may use something else
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.880]   "that's a little cheaper than DFA," whatever it was.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.720]   It was a flood of people.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   But you'll probably hear this tomorrow from Charlie Ellis.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.480]   There's something in the markets
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.840]   called regression to the mean.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.440]   And what happened?
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.320]   Well, we had a long period of underperformance.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.200]   Since 2007, small cap value and factors in general
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.600]   have underperformed the market significantly.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.020]   Let's see, it's 2023 now.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:58.020]   So what is that, 16 years, 17 years, roughly?
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.680]   Weak hands have already thrown in the towel.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.740]   You're trying to beat the market.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.120]   That's why you did this.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.360]   Come on, right?
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.000]   That's why you do small value.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   You're trying to beat the market.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.280]   How long are you gonna hang in there?
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.480]   17 years, 15 years, 10 years?
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.000]   How long you gonna give it?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.080]   Most people, a lot of people who contact me,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.280]   and I do that hourly model now,
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.540]   they've already thrown in the towel,
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.840]   or they wanna throw in the towel.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.280]   They're done, especially as you get older.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.840]   I mean, you know, I'm on Medicare now.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.260]   The last thing I want is complexity in my portfolio
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.400]   or things that have underperformed.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.720]   So anyway, so the performance-chasing mentality
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.320]   or the performance-chasing mindset
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.140]   that got people into factor investing to begin with
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.040]   isn't really factored into these studies.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.000]   They talk about the premiums that they delivered
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.200]   since 1928 or '26 or whatever the year is,
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.880]   but they don't talk about the mental aspect of it.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.320]   In the long periods of time
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.360]   in which there's this drought of returns
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.780]   where people who got in during that I-gotta-have-DFA period
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.680]   have already thrown in their hand, and guess what?
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.960]   They, guaranteed now, are gonna underperform
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.620]   the stock market since inception, guaranteed,
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.400]   because they have no chance of making that back
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.440]   if small-cap value actually comes back.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.320]   Therefore, I'm gonna tell you something John Bogle said.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.320]   John Bogle was way advanced, way advanced on this stuff.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.320]   He said, you know, it's a lot easier in life
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:37.360]   over your retirement to just hold the stock market,
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.880]   just hold the whole market.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.040]   I mean, people are okay holding the market.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.360]   You allocate a certain amount to the market,
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.760]   you own an index fund that owns the whole market,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.240]   and you're done, it's easy.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.600]   You can do that.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.720]   As factors, much, much more difficult.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.580]   So Rick's bottom line on all this.
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.920]   You could be rewarded for adding additional factors
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.200]   to your portfolio in the long term,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.400]   but those premiums may not be guaranteed.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.880]   They may be a lot smaller,
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.740]   or maybe they've gone away entirely.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.560]   The only guarantees that you will have
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.280]   is you are taking a risk when you do this.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.480]   You are taking a risk
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.240]   that you're not gonna get a market return.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.200]   You're also gonna pay more.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.340]   You're also making your portfolio more complex,
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:27.500]   and the tracking error to the market,
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.040]   if it goes on for a long enough period of time,
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.240]   you may decide to blow out,
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.560]   and now you've permanently locked in on the performance
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.020]   relative to the total stock market return.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.080]   If you are in, okay, so here's my advice
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.440]   to the people who are already doing this, Paul.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.280]   Okay? (laughs)
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.560]   Stay in.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.160]   You've got sunk cost.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.780]   I mean, you've been in it, you've been losing,
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.880]   it's been underperforming.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.080]   I mean, it's hard, okay?
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.600]   But you've got sunk cost,
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.760]   so you really need to stay in this thing, okay?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.760]   If you're thinking about adding additional factors,
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.960]   I say limit your exposure to 25%,
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.800]   and what do I mean by that?
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.600]   You have a total stock market of 75,
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.400]   and then you do a very heavily concentrated portfolio
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.980]   of no more than 25% of small cap value.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:23.120]   And you need to do it for a very long period of time,
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.000]   probably the rest of your life,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.080]   and that may not be long enough.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.640]   In fact, Paul was saying he put it in his,
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.360]   what was it, your granddaughter's account?
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.900]   Is that what it was? (laughs)
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.000]   So remember, the most important decision we make,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.460]   so let's get back to basics,
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.840]   the most important decision we make as investors
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.840]   with our portfolio is your beta allocation,
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.000]   your beta allocation.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.680]   How much stock market beta are you going to have?
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.280]   How much bond market beta are you going to have?
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.520]   Jim Dolly gave the presentation about real estate,
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.080]   which would include your home.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.920]   How much of that beta would you have?
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.040]   How much cash would you have?
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.400]   And then let the markets do their thing.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.920]   If you wanna do small cap investing,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   small cap value investing, it's not important.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.800]   I mean, it becomes increasingly unimportant
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   the older you get.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:21.560]   So this is something that it's hard to talk the talk
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.320]   and walk the walk.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.480]   I always love this.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.920]   This is factor investing.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.880]   It's hard walking on this stuff.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.400]   It is.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.620]   It's hard to swallow 17 years of underperformance.
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.000]   And what is the bottom line?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.840]   What is the risk?
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.640]   What is the biggest risk of factor investing?
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.400]   I don't think it's the fact that these premiums
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.360]   may or may not happen again in the future.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.000]   I mean, I think that if enough people blow out
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.080]   of these factors, which it seems like maybe,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.800]   I mean, the spreads between value and growth
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.040]   just keep on getting bigger and bigger and bigger
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.880]   and bigger and bigger.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.840]   Every year I hear the value people say,
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.640]   hey, hey, look at this, look at that, look at the spread.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.840]   I mean, value has never been cheaper.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.960]   We have except for next year, it gets cheaper.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.920]   The year after that, it gets even cheaper.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.320]   Okay?
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.120]   So if you're gonna do it, you need to do it
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.980]   for the long run, you need to stay in it
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.160]   literally for the rest of your life.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.720]   I mean, it is a 25 year at least commitment
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.160]   to try to get these premiums.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.540]   And that's me, that's my presentation.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.380]   Thank you.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.540]   (audience applauding)
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.440]   - Thank you, Rick.
