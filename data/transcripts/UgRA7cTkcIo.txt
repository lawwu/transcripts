[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   If you're willing to ask, life can give you what you want.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.700]   And so I've seen people who've been at companies for years
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.120]   and have never done that.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.080]   And they're kind of maybe waiting for the employer
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.640]   to be like, oh, here you go.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.120]   And maybe that happens,
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.480]   but often they got to kind of advocate for it.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.400]   And all of a sudden they do it and they're expecting,
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.600]   how dare you, you ingrateful, horrible person,
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.040]   you're fired or whatever.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.640]   Sometimes it's like, yes, okay, here you go.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.120]   Other times it's like a, well, not now.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.680]   And then instead of, I coach them,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.960]   instead of being like, okay, fine, sorry, sorry.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.000]   They're like, you know what?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.640]   Okay, can you tell me more about when that might be
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.360]   or what might I do that might warrant
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.920]   that kind of promotion or pay increase?
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.000]   Being in that direct contact with their employer,
