[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the fourth chapter and the thirteenth verse.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.380]   The thirteenth verse in the fourth chapter in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:22.480]   Till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:31.240]   unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.040]   I want really to deal only with the first words in this thirteenth verse.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.240]   Till or until we all come.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.040]   Now I call your attention to these words not only because it comes next in our consideration
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:58.280]   of this great epistle to the Ephesians, but because we happen to be meeting together this
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.520]   morning on what has come to be known as Armistice or Remembrance Sunday.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:13.960]   And I am anxious that those two things should be borne in mind as I proceed to an exposition
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.880]   of these particular words.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.760]   Let us remind ourselves that the scriptures, while they speak to us eternal truth, are
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.360]   always relevant.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.480]   Any impression that is ever given that the scriptures are not relevant is false to the
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.480]   scriptures.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.960]   They are timeless and they are ageless, and for that reason they are always contemporary.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.880]   The scriptures deal with local history, immediate history, at particular times, but they deal
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.480]   with all history.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.000]   And it is very important and essential that we as God's people should always bear that
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.760]   in mind.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.740]   Now there is perhaps no danger that confronts us and tends to afflict us so much as members
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:17.160]   of the Christian Church in days and times such as these as our failure to understand
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.320]   the many-sidedness of the gospel.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:31.340]   This is perhaps something that different sections of the Church are guilty of in differing ways.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.920]   Perhaps the chief danger confronting those of us who are evangelical is to conceive exclusively
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:47.480]   of the gospel in personal terms and to forget its larger ambit, its wider scope, while thanking
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.280]   God that primarily, and the thing that affects us most urgently, is the fact that God is
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.340]   the God of salvation in a personal sense.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.660]   We must never lose sight of the fact that God is still God the Creator, the God who
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.440]   has made the whole world, the God to whom the whole world still belongs, the God under
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.880]   whose hand the whole world and all its affairs and everything that happens in it still are.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.600]   That I say is perhaps our particular danger, but there are others, of course, who go to
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.400]   the other extreme and they so concentrate on what they regard as the general message
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.620]   of the gospel as to ignore and forget entirely the individual message, and thereby, of course,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.400]   they waste their time because the general, in God's plan and God's scheme, is always
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.740]   brought past in and through the particular.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:54.720]   But I say that our danger perhaps is to fail to view ourselves and all our experiences
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.020]   in the light of this larger, bigger teaching that is presented to us in the Scriptures.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:10.160]   What I mean is something like this, that so often we tend to live in compartments, that
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.900]   we may be perfectly clear in our minds as to our own personal position and relationship
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.860]   to God in Christ, but we do not seem to be clear as to what is happening in general,
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.440]   as to what is happening in the world and in history, contemporary history.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.100]   We may not be perfectly clear as to what is happening in the whole realm of the Church
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.100]   as we ought.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.060]   Now there is a great deal, I think, of confusion about this very thing at the present time,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.580]   and perhaps the confusion is greatest of all with respect to the Church herself, what she
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.860]   is, what her function is, what she is meant to be doing in the world at this present hour.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.780]   Now it is to that, in particular, that I am anxious to direct attention this morning,
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.900]   because it does seem to me more and more that the real tragedy today is the failure of the
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.980]   Christian Church to speak, to speak from God, to speak the biblical message, and to speak
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.860]   it with authority.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.220]   And that, I suggest, is due to the fact that she so persistently fails to take her commends
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.700]   and her orders from the Bible itself, but rather takes it from her own thinking and
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.380]   philosophizing and, indeed, perhaps from the world itself.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.820]   Now let me put all this into the setting of this particular day.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.500]   The danger on a day like this is that the Church should allow her message to be determined
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:54.060]   by the world instead of insisting that it is still determined by the Scriptures.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:04.580]   It is very natural that the Church finds herself but a small minority in society, and she is
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.340]   concerned about the masses that are outside.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.100]   And the temptation that comes to her is, of course, to say to herself, "Well, now if
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.820]   I talk to the people about things that they understand and they like, they will begin
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.420]   to listen, and they will come to church."
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.300]   Now, as you are well aware, the Church is doing that constantly, will jump at any opportunity
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.180]   to speak to the world as it were in its terms and on its own level.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.340]   What more useful, therefore, than a day such as this?
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:42.500]   And so the Church becomes a kind of court chaplain, or a state chaplain, and speaks
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:50.220]   a vague general message, a message which is rarely dictated by the world that is outside
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.220]   the Church.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.960]   Now that, as I think we have been seeing very clearly the last Sunday mornings, is something
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.720]   which is entirely wrong and false.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.220]   The whole object of this particular fourth chapter, at this point in particular, is to
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.500]   show that everything that the Church does is to be ordained and determined and decided
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.260]   by the Lord himself.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:20.180]   This Lord who has descended and then ascended and who has led captivity captive and who
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:28.080]   is now in the heavens and filling all things, it is he that determines everything for the
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.760]   Church.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.340]   He determines, as we have seen, all the offices in the Church, the men who fill the offices.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.380]   It is he who determines what the function of these offices is.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.200]   It is he who decides what the message is and everything in connection with it.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:52.040]   That is why we have this revelation, and therefore what can be more tragic than that the Church
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   should speak as it were in and of herself and try to please men and to have a message
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.760]   which is determined by some human situation.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   It seems to me to be an utter denial, not only of the authority of the Scriptures, but
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.320]   of the whole message of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.720]   It is tragic, of course, for a further reason, that it is a sheer waste of breath, a waste
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.540]   of energy, and a waste of time.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:27.380]   Think of all that will probably be said today from Christian pulpits about political matters
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.800]   and international affairs and so on.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.080]   Is it likely that any government anywhere is going to pay the slightest attention to
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.240]   it?
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.960]   Does it have the slightest influence upon affairs?
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.700]   And in any case, who are ministers of Christ in this respect?
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.120]   What authority have they to speak about such matters?
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.440]   They can only express their own opinions, and they contradict one another.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.620]   Some are on one side, some are on the other.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.720]   Some will be preaching nothing but pacifism today, others will all must be preaching militarism
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.920]   and calling upon the nations to arm against the menace of communism.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   And so the message of the Church is utterly divided because of these opinions of men which
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.100]   are not based upon the Scriptures.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:20.560]   Now, it is important, therefore, as I think you will see, that we should have a clear
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.000]   understanding of the message of the Gospel, the message of the Scriptures, what the Church
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.200]   is here and what the Church is supposed to do.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.320]   And it seems to me that in these words that we are looking at, we have it very plainly
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:43.120]   and very clearly, so that there is no excuse for us if we miss it.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.360]   What is happening in the world at the present time?
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.260]   What is all this to do with us?
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.760]   What is the relevance, if you like, of Christianity to the present time?
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.840]   What is the message of God's Word to this world as it is this morning?
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.040]   Now, that is the question.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:05.800]   How do we, as individual Christians, see ourselves in this present context?
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.620]   Are we confused?
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.840]   Are we bewildered?
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:15.080]   I say we have no right to be, because the whole position is put very plainly and very
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:23.000]   clearly before us in these words, "Till, until, we all come."
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.160]   Now then, what does it mean?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.000]   Well, let me try and divide it up and put it in the form of a number of propositions.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:38.400]   The first thing that is clearly taught here is this, is that God has a plan for this world.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.220]   You see, the message is this, that the Lord Jesus Christ was ascended back into the heavens
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.760]   and is there at the right hand of God, has now determined certain things with respect
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.760]   to the Church.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:56.800]   The Church is to do certain things, and it's to go on doing it, we are told here, "Till,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.000]   until."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.400]   In other words, we are told at once that there is a time factor in all this, that in spite
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.760]   of all that is happening in the world, that God has got his great plan, and that this
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:19.380]   plan has been determined in all its details.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:26.760]   That in the midst of all that seems to be so contingent and almost accidental, something
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.640]   else is happening.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:36.120]   God's great plan and purpose has been set in motion, it's been set into operation,
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   and it's going on.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:46.000]   Now, the God who seems to be altogether apart from the world, and who so many think of at
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.360]   the present time as doing nothing at all, and even Christian people may think that because
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.480]   they've got hold of this idea that God can only do things in one particular way, namely
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.440]   intervene dramatically and put an end to dictators or to give a victory to a country or something
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.240]   like that, they fail to see that the whole time God is acting and God is bringing his
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.520]   great and mighty and glorious purposes to pass.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:21.000]   Now, you can't read the Bible, surely, even in a very superficial and cursory manner,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.880]   without seeing clearly that there is this great plan of God.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.280]   I don't want to stay with this this morning, but take your Old Testament and you will see
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:42.160]   that all along God is there over all and above all, does things at precise moments, has determined
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.200]   when things are to happen, and he brings it all to pass, intervenes even into our history
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:54.240]   at times, and then, of course, supremely when the fullness of the times was come, God sent
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.800]   forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are under the
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   law.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   There it is.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.200]   And out of that, the life and death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, comes this Christian
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.480]   Church to which you and I belong.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:17.640]   And now the great teaching is that through the Church, God is bringing this mighty purpose
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.240]   of his to pass.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:25.040]   Now then, there I say is the first principle which we must lay hold of, and never forget
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.560]   it.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.280]   You will look at all this again in the Scriptures and you will see so frequently how God seems
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.400]   to have abandoned the process.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   How often did he seem to have forgotten the children of Israel, and their enemies rose
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   up and triumphed, and they boasted and shouted, and the children of Israel themselves began
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.880]   to ask, "Where is God?
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.080]   Has God forgotten us?
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.000]   Has God forgotten to be good?"
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   You will find them expressing it in the Psalms and elsewhere.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.280]   God seems to be abandoning and forgetting his people, but he never does.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.500]   The whole message of the Bible is to say that he doesn't.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.000]   He waits.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.440]   We don't understand it, but he told Abram, "You remember that certain things would be
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:22.400]   permitted until the iniquity of the Amorites is fulfilled, then he is going to do something."
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.480]   In other words, we must learn to understand something of God's timing, God's chronology,
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.960]   if I may so express it, though he is timeless.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.840]   But the principle is, above everything else, to realize that there is this great plan and
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.560]   purpose which is there and still is being pursued and carried out.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:53.260]   The second principle is that this plan centers in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.680]   We are seeing this constantly in this epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.400]   The apostles stated it once and forever in the tenth verse of the first chapter.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:09.040]   "Here it is, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he, God, might gather
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:17.800]   together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.160]   even in him."
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.760]   Now, this is, of course, an aspect of the matter, again, that is so important on a day
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.560]   like this.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.240]   Any message that is delivered today, which is not delivered specifically in terms of
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.280]   the Lord Jesus Christ, is not a Christian message.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.360]   Isn't it tragic to think that so much paganism is abroad?
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.880]   And that the Church even is content to talk about God in vague generalities and try to
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.040]   give comfort to people who are not Christians.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.360]   There is no comfort to people who are not Christians.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.080]   Everything is in Christ and God's dealings with men and with the world are entirely and
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:09.880]   only in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.960]   He is the very center of this plan.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.600]   Everything until he came looks forward to him.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.960]   It is a great promise.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.840]   It is a preparation for him.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   He comes.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.600]   That is the pivotal moment.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.080]   And therefore, I say, for the Christian Church to talk in vague generalities about God and
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:38.120]   goodness and morality is a very denial of this precious gospel.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:49.240]   The plan centers in the Son of God, who left eternity and came into time in the flesh,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.760]   in order that this great plan and purpose might really be put into operation.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:03.120]   Oh, I say, let us be sure that we are perfectly clear about all this.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.120]   The Church is not an adjunct of the State.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.720]   The State has no right to tell the Church what she is to do.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:17.280]   That is the tragedy of the ages as we see so clearly the prostitution of the Christian
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   Church.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.920]   The Church becoming just a department of State and subservient to the State, and the Church
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:32.880]   speaking the language of statesmen, it is an utter denial of all this.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.720]   Isn't that the very thing that the book of Revelation means when it talks about this
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   great whore?
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.640]   Isn't that it, seen perhaps most clearly of all in Roman Catholicism in the Middle
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:51.800]   Ages, but our last seen many, many times since then, even in Protestantism?
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:58.120]   The Church is something which is simply the spiritual side of the State.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   It is an utter denial, I say, of the very central message of the New Testament itself.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.520]   No, no.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:12.440]   This message is a specific message, and it is all in terms of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.200]   Christ and our relationship to him.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.920]   I don't hesitate to assert that all God's dealings with mankind this morning, in every
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.520]   shape and form, are in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.400]   It is he alone who saves.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.040]   It is he who is going to judge.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.560]   He said himself that the Father has committed the judgment unto him.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.880]   Everything is in and through him.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:44.120]   And therefore any message which is not centrally in terms of him is not Christianity, whatever
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.480]   else it may be.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:54.920]   Here, I say, is the supreme tragedy that a veiled paganism so often masquerades as Christianity.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.880]   And it is not surprising that the Christian Church is as she is.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.880]   It is not surprising that the masses of the people are outside when they think that the
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.120]   Church is but a department of state, and that it is being used and manipulated, and that
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   they won't listen.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.120]   No, no.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.880]   This is something unique and separate.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.120]   This is God's kingdom.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.840]   This is Christ's kingdom.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.820]   It doesn't belong to those kingdoms.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.680]   It has no real relationship with it.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.520]   It stands over and against it.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.520]   Very well.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.120]   Having said that, let me come to this.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.680]   Now then, I say that God has a plan, and it is a plan that centres in and is worked out
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.080]   through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.620]   To whom does this apply?
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.440]   To whom does this plan of God apply?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.840]   The answer here is, "We all."
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:46.560]   This is going on, he says, until "we all" come.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.560]   Who are "we"?
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:53.160]   Well, surely there need be no discussion about this.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.120]   The "we all" means Christian people only.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.520]   It means only those who are members of the body of Christ.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.400]   The apostle is speaking about the Church.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.920]   He is not interested here in anything but the Church, and the "we all" refers to
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.240]   the members of the Church.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.160]   "We all" does not refer to the whole world.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.340]   Now that, it seems to me, is the essential error.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.840]   And there is no error that is more grievous than this.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.240]   And that is why I want to emphasise it particularly this morning.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:36.560]   The Bible divides the world into two groups and two classes.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.920]   And if ever there was a need of asserting this, it is at this present time.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.080]   The Bible says that there is a sharp division on the one side of the lost, on the other
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.720]   side of the saved.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:55.760]   Now you see, that is inevitable because it is all centred in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.280]   What determines everything is a man's relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.320]   And if you are in the right relationship to him, you are among the saved.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.120]   If you are in the wrong relationship, you are amongst the lost.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.360]   Now that is a division that runs right through the Bible.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.920]   It is in the Old Testament.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.760]   God made a nation for himself, the children of Israel.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   He separated them.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.880]   Here was Israel, there was the rest of the world, the nations.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.720]   And it goes on in the New Testament, the church is the new nation.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.360]   Here is God's nation, the church.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.800]   So that the division is those who are in the church and belong to the body of Christ, and
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.840]   those who don't.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   Now then, this is the thing that comes out of it, that there is no message in the New
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:55.160]   Testament for the lost, except to tell them that they are lost, that they are under condemnation,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:01.880]   that they are under the wrath of God, and that unless they repent, they remain lost
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.340]   and will be lost to all eternity.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:12.240]   This is what I want to emphasise, that the New Testament has nothing to say to the world
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.720]   this morning, except that.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   Nothing whatsoever.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:26.560]   Our only message to those who are in the world is to repent and to believe the gospel.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   Nothing else.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.240]   There is no further interest taken.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.120]   If a man does not repent and believe the gospel, well, he remains where he is, and the gospel
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:39.160]   has nothing further to say to him.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:46.040]   There is no hope for the world outside Christ, none whatsoever.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:52.920]   There is no improvement predicted or prophesied for the world, none whatsoever.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.900]   There is no greater error or heresy than to think that it is the business of Christian
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.680]   preaching to improve the world somewhat.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:09.880]   It is a denial of the gospel—I am using my language advisedly and soberly.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.440]   The idea that it is the business of the Church to recommend Christian principles to the world
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.920]   and plead with it and ask it to put it into practice, to send messages to statesmen and
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:24.680]   ask them to put it into practice, I say is a denial of this.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.560]   The only message of the gospel to the world is to tell it to repent because it is under
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:34.440]   the wrath of God, and that unless it repents, it is lost and lost eternally.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:42.440]   There is no message, I say, but to repent and believe.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:51.160]   The world outside Christ is entirely without hope.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.320]   And all that is happening to it is that, according to God's wisdom, it is being kept within
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:03.680]   bounds, a certain limitation is placed upon its evil and the manifestation of its evil,
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.640]   so that all the variations that may take place in human history are absolutely irrelevant.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.860]   There are variations.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.000]   Sometimes the world seems to be a bit better than it was at other times.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.080]   There is no doubt at all that the world was a better place a hundred years ago than it
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.400]   is today, but it is an absolute irrelevancy.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.600]   Though people then behaved in a better manner than they do now, if they were not saved,
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.360]   they were amongst the lost and the damned, and the fact that they were a little bit more
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.280]   moral will avail them nothing at the day of judgment, nothing at all.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.800]   There is no other category.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.940]   The Bible is not interested in bad, a little bit better, better still, very good, excellent.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.480]   It has not got such categories.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.680]   It says you are either in Christ or else you are not in Christ.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:54.280]   You are either saved or else you are lost, and I think this must be emphasized, that
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:01.520]   it has no message whatsoever for the man who is in Christ but just that.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.120]   "Well," you say, "what is happening?"
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.360]   Well, what is happening is this.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:15.240]   God in and through Christ is calling out a people for himself.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   This message of repentance and of belief in Christ is sent out to all men, and those who
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:27.040]   believe it are the called of God in Christ, and he calls them unto himself, and he sets
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.920]   them apart in this new kingdom, the kingdom of God and of Christ.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.000]   The church is its present form.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:45.120]   And the teaching is that God's plan and purpose is only with respect to them.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.320]   There is nothing more to be said about the others.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.920]   They will continue in sin.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.960]   They will die in sin.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.760]   They will go to perdition, and we shall see in a moment the end of all that.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.400]   There is no plan there.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.440]   It is simply that they are outside the plan.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:05.080]   The plan is only with respect to those who belong to Christ, who are in Christ.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.840]   In other words, every New Testament epistle is addressed only to Christian people.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.840]   Every New Testament epistle is addressed to a church or to a number of churches.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.680]   It is never meant for the world.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.120]   It was never meant that this ethic which we find here should be commended to the man who
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.160]   is outside Christ.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.560]   He cannot live it, and even if he tried to and succeeded partially, it would avail him
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.560]   nothing.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.380]   If he is not in Christ, he is outside his loss.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:38.960]   The plan, I say, has reference only to those who are members of the body of Christ, till
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:48.760]   we all come, and nobody else, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.520]   Very well, then, what is the plan?
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:57.760]   Well, here is something very wonderful for us to look at this morning.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.680]   We see the world as it is in its travel and in its trouble.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.720]   Some of us have known two world wars.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:13.480]   You ask what is happening, what does all this mean, where am I in the midst of all this?
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.440]   Ah, the answer is this, that you are a part of God's great plan.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.960]   And what is his plan?
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:25.440]   Well, his plan is the perfecting of his own people.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:32.840]   Christ has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   What for?
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.680]   Well, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.440]   of the body of Christ, until we all come.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:51.540]   Here it is, in the unity of the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:59.760]   perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   This is what is happening.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.640]   Oh, but sir, some of this is Phariseeism, you are setting yourselves apart, and you
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.120]   say God is interested in you and not in anybody else.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.560]   It isn't Phariseeism for this reason.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.880]   The Pharisee thought he was a man apart because he was such a good man and a fine fellow.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.760]   We say we have been set apart because we are desperate sinners who have realized it, and
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.200]   who have so realized it, that we are not like the men of the world trusting to ourselves,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.760]   but are trusting only to Christ.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.160]   And that he has taken hold of us, and that he has done something to us, and that he is
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:36.600]   going to do something to us, until we shall all be made perfect and become these perfect
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.440]   men, and attain unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.560]   My dear friend, do you think of yourself like that?
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.460]   Have you seen yourself like that as a member of the Christian church, and as a citizen
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.920]   of God's kingdom?
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.000]   You say, what is happening in all this that is taking place in the world?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.120]   Well, don't look at the world, look rather at this, and then look at yourself in this.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.880]   God's plan for the church, it has been going for centuries, and it is still going.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.440]   And do you know what it is?
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:18.840]   It is this, he is preparing a bride for his dearly beloved, only begotten son.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.120]   The church is compared to a building, she is compared to an empire, she is compared
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.280]   to a family.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.880]   But there is this other comparison, worked out by the apostle in chapter 5 of this very
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:34.840]   epistle, the church as the bride of Christ, the bride of the Lamb.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.720]   We had it again in that nineteenth chapter of the book of Revelation that I read to you
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.720]   at the beginning.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.240]   Oh, that we caught sight of this, this morning, and had a glimpse of it.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.320]   Stop thinking for a moment about statesmen, and international conferences, and hydrogen
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   bombs, and possible wars, and this and that.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.200]   All that, you know, in a sense to us is irrelevant.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.440]   I know we are going to suffer, as everybody else will have to suffer if such things come
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.640]   to pass.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.040]   But I don't stop at that, I look up.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.240]   My citizenship is in heaven, or if you like the other translation, we are a colony of
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   heaven.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.200]   Well, let's think of the homeland, therefore, on this Armistice Day, when we think of death
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.840]   and the end of all things.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:19.560]   Here is our position, the bride of the Lamb.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.880]   And what is happening?
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.680]   Well, we are being prepared for him.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.920]   That is the ministry of the church.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.600]   My business this morning is not to deliver to you my opinions as to what I think the
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:39.680]   Prime Minister or anybody else should do about the atomic bomb, or about armaments, or about
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.280]   industry, or a thousand and one things.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.120]   I have got something infinitely bigger and more important to tell you, and it is this
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:50.360]   to tell you, that if you are a member of the Christian church, you are going to be the
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.280]   bride of the Lamb.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.720]   And my business is to prepare you for that, for this glorious day that is coming.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:03.040]   I have no opinion to give to statesmen, but I can speak with authority here.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:10.400]   It is the plan and the purpose of God in Christ to prepare this kingdom for him, this bride
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:16.640]   for him, and he is going to come, and he is going to receive her.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:23.720]   For you see, we do not only preach a Christ who came nearly two thousand years ago, and
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:29.600]   who suffered under Pontius Pilate, and who died and was buried and rose again.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:35.520]   We preach a Christ who is coming back, coming back as the King of kings and the Lord of
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   lords.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.880]   Have you seen the rider on the white horse, with the sword in his mouth, which is his
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.880]   word?
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:48.720]   He is coming, King of kings, Lord of lords, and he is coming to receive his bride.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:57.000]   He is coming to destroy and to judge all his enemies, and to set up his everlasting and
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.840]   eternal kingdom, and, my dear friends, you and I will be in it.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:11.200]   Fancy the Church wasting her time on politics and social matters, all irrelevant, paid no
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.800]   attention to, and ignoring this.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.760]   I have nothing to say to the world this morning except this, that unless every individual
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.680]   in it repents and believes the gospel, he is doomed to everlasting perdition.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:36.200]   But I can tell him that if he does repent and believe, he will be put into this body,
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:42.520]   he will be prepared for this great crowning day that is coming, he will be in a kingdom
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:48.120]   that belongs to God and to Christ, an everlasting kingdom, and he is going to share in the glory
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   of it all.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.760]   Here is the comfort.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.160]   I have no human comfort to give you.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.620]   What is the value, to you, of my opinion as to whether there is going to be a war or not?
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.840]   What is the value of my agitating here that they should stop manufacturing hydrogen bombs?
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.520]   They will not listen to me, and even if they did listen, what difference does it make?
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.560]   We have all got to die and face God and eternity.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.300]   That is not the message.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.680]   That is man's message.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.080]   Here is God's message.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:22.280]   The members of the body of Christ, the bride that is being prepared for the great marriage
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.920]   feast of the Lamb, the Son of God, here is the plan.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.600]   He gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:45.880]   the body of Christ, until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:51.960]   the Son of God, and to a perfect man, and to the measure of the stature of the fulness
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   of Christ.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.680]   Fancy wasting time in preaching about earthly kingdoms and earthly affairs when we belong
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.080]   to a heavenly kingdom and have these heavenly affairs.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:11.400]   So I end on this note, the certainty of this plan, until.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.240]   He gave some apostles, etc., to do the work until.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.360]   Oh, it is absolutely certain.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.720]   Listen to the same apostle putting it in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:30.560]   These things, he says, are to go on, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in and
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:43.280]   so all Israel shall be saved, until the Lord knoweth them that are his, says Paul to Timothy,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:49.760]   the foundation of God standeth sure, the Lord knoweth them that are his.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.200]   And he knows them every one.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.320]   And there is a given number, it is the fullness.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.120]   And this will go on until every single Gentile that is to be saved has been saved, and every
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.800]   Israelite that is to be saved has been saved, until.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.080]   Nothing can stop it.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.900]   Let the world do its worst.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.760]   Let the principalities and powers do what they will.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.800]   Let the heathen rage and roar and the people imagine a vain thing, yet have I set my King
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:31.280]   upon my holy Mount of Zion, and nobody can stop it.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.120]   All Israel shall be saved.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:43.700]   There will be not a single one left unsaved who belongs to the redeemed.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:50.240]   But also let us remember that this all has another emphasis and signification, till we
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:56.680]   all come, the collective, yes, and the particular.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.200]   It's been running right through this chapter, hasn't it?
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:07.920]   He has put it in general and then he says, but unto every one of us is grace given.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:14.600]   This process is going on until every one of us who is a member of the body of Christ shall
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:21.640]   be made perfect, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:27.120]   What a message on a morning like this, that you and I are to be blameless and faultless
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.200]   the sons of God.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:35.240]   He is going on with this until there is no vestige of evil left in us anywhere, nor a
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.160]   suspicion of sin.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.960]   Why we must be perfect to be the bride of the Lamb, and the process is going on, we
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:51.880]   are told, until we shall all, all every one of us, attain unto this, and shall together
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.960]   be presented to him as his holy bride.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.360]   My dear friends, there is nothing more sure than this.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.720]   I don't know what's going to happen in the world, nobody else knows, but of this I know,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:12.080]   that he who has already conquered every enemy and led captivity captive will ride on in
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:21.760]   his majesty until his every enemy has been defeated and routed and destroyed, and all
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:31.520]   his people shall be safely gathered in and made perfect and ready to receive him.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.880]   That is what is happening.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.680]   So I beseech you, see yourself in this context and in this setting.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.840]   Don't let your thinking be determined by the world.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.440]   God forbid that the church of all institutions should do that, but let us not do it as individuals
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.440]   either.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.680]   Let's see ourselves in this plan of God, the plan with respect to us, the separated
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:58.800]   people taken out of this present evil world, separated unto Christ.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.960]   Let us realize, I say, that this is the meaning of the church and of our membership in the
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.000]   church.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.520]   Let us be certain that we take the Bible's view of everything that is happening in the
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:17.080]   world round and about us, but above all, oh, let us urgently consider this, that our first
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.880]   and supreme task is to prepare ourselves for him.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.320]   He that hath his hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.920]   Did you notice how it was put in the seventh verse of that nineteenth chapter of the book
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:40.800]   of Revelation, when we are told that he comes, then this, "His wife hath made herself ready."
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:47.440]   In other words, as the world darkens and sin becomes more evident and loud and arrogant,
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:54.040]   your business and mine is to perfect ourselves, to purify ourselves, to prepare ourselves
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:01.160]   for him, his wife hath made herself ready.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.680]   Are you making yourself ready?
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:10.680]   You are a part of the bride, you are a part of this wife, the wife of the Lamb, the Son
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:18.200]   of God, her wife, his wife, hath made herself ready.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:24.960]   Beloved people, the way you and I can help the world, even most of all today, is to show
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.400]   what it means to be in Christ, to show the difference.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.080]   We do that by making ourselves ready for him.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.440]   It is the saints who have always influenced this world most of all.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.000]   It isn't as we conform to the world and make alliances with it, and get confused with it.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.120]   It isn't thus that we influence it.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.200]   It's by showing the difference of being in Christ.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:57.400]   It's by making ourselves ready for the husband, the Lord, the King of Kings, and the Lord
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   of Lords.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.280]   May God enable us to do so.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.160]   He has done all from his side.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.800]   He has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.640]   He's made the provision.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.720]   That is their task.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:20.520]   God grant that we may all realize it and respond to the teaching.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.160]   Amen.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.080]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
