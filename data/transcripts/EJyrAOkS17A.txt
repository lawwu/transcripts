[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention are to be found in the Gospel according
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.880]   to St. John, the first chapter, reading verses 10, 11, and 12.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.200]   He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.760]   He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.720]   But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.480]   them that believe on his name.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.620]   Now I don't propose for a moment, and had not proposed quite apart from the weather,
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.280]   to deal with that great statement in any exhaustive manner.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.740]   What I'm anxious to do, rather, is this, to draw certain lessons from what we've been
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.040]   considering together for so many Sunday mornings.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.620]   We've been considering the coming of the Son of God into this world of time, and we've
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.900]   done so in particular in the light of the teaching of the law.
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.180]   In that way we have been able to see why, if we were ever to be saved, it was essential
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.020]   that the Son of God should come into the world, and how no one else could possibly have saved
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.020]   us.
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.140]   He is a great visitant, nothing and no one, but he who is God, who takes unto himself
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.780]   human nature, and therefore is able to do for us everything that is necessary before
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.780]   we can be reconciled to God and become his children.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.300]   Now it seemed to me that it would be a good and a right thing, this first Sunday after
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.140]   Christmas, that we should look back on that, as it were, and consider some of the results
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.620]   of his coming.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.700]   Or if you prefer it, I desire to draw certain practical lessons for our benefit and for
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.900]   our edification.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.540]   And I go to these verses because it seems to me that they put their emphasis upon these
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.980]   practical matters.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.100]   So let's divide it up and look at it like this.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.540]   Let us look at the temporary result of his coming as far as he himself was concerned.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.380]   In order to do that, we must look at the first phrase in the fourteenth verse.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.220]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.620]   Now there is, of course, a statement of what we have already been considering, the incarnation,
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.980]   the birth of the Son of God from the Virgin Mary.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.540]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.980]   But I am anxious to look at that in a different way this morning.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.420]   I want to call attention, I say, to the temporary result of his coming as far as he himself
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.420]   was concerned.
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.340]   And it is in this word "dwelt among us" because the real translation of that word
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.100]   is "tabernacled amongst us" or "dwelt, if you like, in a tent amongst us."
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.620]   Now this is not my idea.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.020]   Everybody has agreed about this.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.500]   The word that was used there by the apostle is the word that was commonly used for people
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.180]   living in tents.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.220]   And it is, as I want to show you, the word that is used so constantly about life in this
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.660]   world in the whole of the Bible.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.420]   The word became flesh and tabernacled, dwelt in a tent among us.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.620]   Now the importance of that, of course, is this.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.700]   We are reminded that he actually did come into this world as a man and he lived in it
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.540]   exactly as we do.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.460]   He shared his experiences, all the experiences to which we are subject.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.420]   Anything that can possibly ever come to meet us, he has been through it all.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.020]   He dwelt, he tabernacled amongst us.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.380]   He lived the life of an ordinary person.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.220]   He was born, as we remember, on Christmas morning in poverty.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.900]   He knew poverty, he knew need, probably knew something about hunger, certainly knew about
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.900]   thirst.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.780]   We have got examples of that.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.620]   And thus he shared all the common experiences of men and women in this world.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.620]   There is nothing more comforting than that, that he has been here and he knows all about
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.980]   it and there is nothing, therefore, that can happen to us apart from sin, but that he himself
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.740]   has already been through it and has experienced it.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.860]   But the thing I want to emphasize is this.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.020]   That was only a temporary result of his coming.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.660]   He tabernacled amongst us.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:09.640]   He, as it were, established his tent and he dwelt in it for a while.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.020]   But it was only for a while.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.140]   His life in this world was this temporary, tent-like existence.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.220]   Now it is very interesting to notice in the Gospels how he was always aware of that.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.540]   He knew it and he regarded it like that.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:35.220]   He did not come into this world, as it were, to settle down in it.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.560]   He came as a visitor.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.340]   He knew that he was only to be here for a while and his whole outlook upon life was
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.980]   just that.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.700]   And that is why you will find, particularly in this Gospel according to St. John, he keeps
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.460]   on referring to his hour, to his time, and things like that.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.180]   You get it at the very beginning in the second chapter in connection with the marriage feast
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.620]   at Cana of Galilee, when you remember the wine had finished, and his mother saith unto
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.340]   him, "They have no wine."
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.820]   Jesus saith unto her, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.820]   Thine hour is not yet come."
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.380]   And you remember how in the twelfth chapter, just before the cross, he offers up that prayer.
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.320]   He says, "Father, the hour is come."
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.980]   And you noticed it again in that seventeenth chapter which we read at the beginning.
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:37.860]   Now all this is indicative of the fact that he was aware always that it was only a temporary
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:45.060]   existence, a tent-like existence which he had in this world.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.220]   Indeed he makes it quite plain and clear that he all along knew that he had come into this
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.380]   world to do a certain bit of work that his father had given him to do.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.860]   He keeps on saying that likewise.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.620]   "I do not my own works," he says, "but the works which the Father hath given me to do."
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.820]   There, just before the cross, in that great high priestly prayer, he says, "Father, I
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.740]   have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.260]   So that all along he gives us this impression that he is aware that it is nothing but a
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.900]   kind of tent-like existence.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.780]   It's entirely removed from any notion of settling down in this world, living for this
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.780]   world.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.180]   No, he only tabernacled amongst us.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.660]   And there, surely, there is a great lesson for all of us.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.840]   That is, I say, the biblical view of life.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:52.540]   That this existence of ours in this world is at its best nothing but a tent-like existence.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.900]   We are but strangers and pilgrims.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.900]   We are travellers.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.900]   We are sojourners.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:05.420]   These are the terms that are used always concerning men and his life in this world.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:11.900]   And there is nothing which is more important for us to remember than just this very thing.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.700]   Now you will find that the apostles have learnt this lesson from him.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:22.140]   Take that great statement of the apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 5, the first verse and following.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:28.740]   "If our earthly house of this tabernacle"—same thing—"if our earthly house of this tent-like
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.460]   existence were dissolved"—and it will be—"we have a building of God, a house
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.540]   not made with hens, eternal in the heavens.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.620]   In this we do groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.620]   heaven.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.820]   For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.140]   Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.140]   of life."
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.300]   Now there is exactly the same notion.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.140]   The apostle had become a Christian, and it had therefore transformed his whole view of
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.940]   life and his outlook upon life in this world.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:11.180]   He now sees that like his Lord and Master before him, he is a kind of temporary visitor
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.800]   in this world.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.060]   So you see, later he writes to the Philippians and says, "Our citizenship is in him."
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.900]   That is our permanent home and dwelling place, the seat and center of our lives and the things
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.700]   by which we are governed.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.700]   Tent-like existence.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:35.940]   Well, here we are, the last Sunday morning of an old year, and we should be reminded
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.940]   of this fact.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.340]   But you see, what matters is the way we react to it.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.740]   Do you find that depressing?
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.940]   Is that a depressing thought?
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.020]   It should not be.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.940]   To the Christian, it should be quite the reverse.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.340]   Think of it in terms of our Lord.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.420]   He came to do this work, he went.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.660]   And therefore, you see, he was in control of life always.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:04.460]   You remember his followers coming to him when he was going to visit the home of Lazarus.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.620]   He had been told that Lazarus was ill and then dead.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.380]   They said, "Do not go.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.380]   You may risk your life."
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.700]   And he turned back and said, "Are there not twelve hours in the day?"
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.700]   By which he means this.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.500]   He says, "It is all right.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.460]   Nothing can happen to me before the due time, before the hour which has been fixed by God."
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:27.380]   He knew that his whole life was planned and mapped by God, and therefore he was able to
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:33.060]   go through this world with all its trials and temptations in the way in which he did.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:39.260]   Well, this, I say, is a great lesson for us as we move along this morning.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.500]   My dear friends, this is but a tent-like existence.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.460]   It is a frail tent.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.940]   Our hold on life is very tenuous.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:56.780]   Let us rejoice in the fact that we look forward to a building, a house of God, not made with
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.220]   hands, eternal in the heavens.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:06.260]   Here we nightly pitch our moving tent a day's march nearer home.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.060]   That is the lesson that we get here.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.660]   The Word was made flesh and, well, tabernacled.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.580]   Lived in a tent amongst us for a while.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.660]   He did, thank God, exactly as we do.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.260]   He had this tent-like existence, but he never kept his eye fixed upon the glory and the
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.260]   eternal.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.020]   So there he is at the end, again in the high priestly prayer, saying, "Father, give me
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.340]   back now the glory which I had with thee from the beginning."
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.180]   He had laid aside the glory while he was in this world.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.980]   He is going back to it.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.660]   He for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.140]   And there is nothing, it seems to me, that is more important for us than just that.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.220]   This is a world of disappointments, a world of sin, a world of war.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.860]   And part of the secret of the Christian's victory over life and over the world and the
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:02.640]   flesh and the devil is that he constantly reminds himself that this is only temporary,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.380]   this is passing.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:11.460]   The glory is that which is yet to come, and it is certain for all the people of God.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:16.340]   Very well, there was one of the temporary results of his coming into the world, but
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.940]   let me go on to another, the permanent result of his coming into the world as far as he
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.940]   himself was concerned.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.100]   We are still looking primarily at him.
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.220]   The word was made, or became, flesh.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.940]   Now this is the most wonderful thing, the most mysterious thing, this.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.300]   This was not temporary.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   The other was temporary.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:47.660]   But it is so vitally important that we should realize that this was not temporary.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.300]   There have been people who have interpreted it like that very wrongly.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.460]   They say, in effect, that the word was made flesh in a temporary manner.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.780]   The word was made flesh for a while and then ceased to be flesh.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.860]   That is quite wrong.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.180]   The word became flesh.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.380]   That is what we are told here.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:17.060]   I do want to call attention to the permanent aspect of this great and wonderful truth.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:23.420]   The coming of our Lord into this world made a permanent difference to him.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:31.220]   Now, as we look at that, we see perhaps in its most wonderful form of all the glory and
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.620]   the wonder of the incarnation and all that resulted from our Lord's coming into this
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.620]   world.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:43.540]   Here, in a sense, is the ultimate measure of the love of God to us in and through our
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.380]   blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.660]   His coming into this world made a permanent difference to him.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:58.060]   I mean this, before he came into the world, he was the eternal Son of God.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:04.060]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.220]   And all that we have seen about him, how that all things were made by him and without him,
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.620]   was not anything made that was made, and so on.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:21.460]   He was the eternal Son of God, coequal, coeternal with the Father.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:29.280]   But coming into this world, he took into that Godhead human nature.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.340]   And that is what is meant by saying that the Word became flesh.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.060]   He was truly a man.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:44.820]   So that looking at him, you see God and man, eternal God, truly man also.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.940]   Now the important thing that I am emphasizing is that this is something that is permanently
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.940]   true of him.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.940]   When he rose from the grave, he rose literally in the body.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:02.700]   That is why we must always hold on to the literal fact of the resurrection of his physical
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.660]   body.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.660]   He did not leave the body behind, he did not leave the manhood behind when he rose and
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.660]   ascended.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:18.540]   No, he rose, he ascended as God-man, not as God only, but as God-man.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:25.520]   And he has taken that manhood right into the eternal glory.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:32.580]   The one who is seated at the right hand of God at this very moment is God and man.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:40.820]   Our manhood, our human nature, is there in him at the very right hand of God in the everlasting
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.540]   and eternal glory at this very moment.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:50.980]   Now here I say it is a permanent result of the Incarnation as it affected him.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.980]   And it is very important.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:57.980]   There is nothing indeed which is more comforting than for us to realize and to grasp this very
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.980]   fact.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:04.260]   I will give you some of the statements of this as we have them in the Scriptures.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:10.280]   Because as I say, if we only remember this, it will help us in times of need.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.820]   Take the statement of it in the epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 4, beginning at verse
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.820]   14.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:27.020]   "Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed through the heavens, Jesus,
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.020]   the Son of God."
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:35.220]   Now, it is very interesting to notice how this man here refers to him not as the Lord
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.420]   Jesus Christ, but deliberately as Jesus, the Son of God.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.420]   Why?
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.940]   Well, it is, I say, to bring out this very point I am trying to make.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:54.220]   That the one who has passed through the heavens as our great high priest is still Jesus, but
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.200]   also Son of God.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:02.020]   So he calls him Jesus, Son of God, to remind us that the manhood is there as well as the
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.020]   Godhead.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.940]   It is a very wonderful statement.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.980]   "Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed through the heavens, Jesus,
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.100]   the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.100]   See, that is the conclusion you draw.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:23.260]   "For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.620]   but one who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.620]   He is still the same.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.900]   He is the one who went through all that while he lived this tabernacle tent-like existence
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.900]   in this world.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.100]   He is still the same one, and he remembers it all.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:44.980]   "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy,
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.820]   and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.820]   But he goes on.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:54.220]   "For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.460]   to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin."
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.780]   What kind of person must he be?
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.740]   He says he must be one who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.100]   the way, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:14.720]   Now, our Lord knew human infirmity.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.380]   He was without sin, as we have been reminded.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.140]   Yes, but certain of the consequences of the fall and sin he did experience.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.660]   There is nothing sinful in infirmities, but he knew something about the infirmities.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.300]   So he can have compassion on the ignorant.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.020]   And by reason ye are of the ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.620]   sins and so on.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.100]   Then we go on to read this.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.420]   "So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that said unto
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:48.700]   him, Thou art my son, today have I begotten thee.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.240]   Who, in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:59.020]   crying, strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:06.700]   in that he feared, though he were a son, yet learned the obedience by the things which
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.220]   he suffered.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.940]   And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.660]   him, called of God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek."
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.700]   It means this.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:26.180]   That while he was here on earth he was learning some things which helped him to be our sympathetic
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.660]   and faithful high priest.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.740]   Able to sympathize with our ignorance, our weakness, our frailties, and all these things.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.780]   And the point he's making is this.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.340]   He still is like that.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.940]   He didn't leave all this which he experienced and learned while he was in this world.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.180]   He didn't leave all that behind when he went to heaven.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.100]   He took it with him.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.500]   And it's there in him now.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.020]   And it is with him and it will always be with him.
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.940]   It's interesting to find in the book of the Acts of the Apostles that Stephen, the martyr,
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:03.100]   as he was being stoned to death, saw the heavens open and there he saw the Son of Man standing
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.420]   at the right hand of God.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.540]   It's the Son of Man he saw.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.380]   He didn't see the eternal Son.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.420]   He saw the Son of Man.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.660]   He was able, as it were, to recognize him because he is still the same.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:25.660]   And do you remember what happened to Paul when he was Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus?
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:32.400]   He saw that face and that glory and he asked his question, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.220]   And do you remember the answer?
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.220]   The answer he got was not, "I am God, the eternal Son.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.460]   I am the Word, the everlasting."
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.460]   No.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:48.140]   "I," says this glorified, risen Lord, "I am Jesus whom thou persecuted."
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.980]   He is still Jesus, though he is there in the glory.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.980]   There is no change.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:59.780]   He has taken the manhood with him and has raised it up to the right hand of God.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.600]   And so you find this emphasized everywhere.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.220]   Again in Hebrews we are told this, "We see Jesus."
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.980]   Remember it's Jesus whom we see.
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.420]   He says we don't see everything yet put under men, but we see Jesus who was made a
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:18.380]   little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.380]   Jesus.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.700]   It's always Jesus, just to emphasize that he is the same person.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:29.340]   But let me give you a final illustration of this because of its wonderful beauty and tenderness.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.260]   Listen to this in the book of Revelation in the first chapter.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.420]   John is given his revelation.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.140]   The Lord Jesus Christ is about to speak to him and to give his message.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.420]   And this is what he tells us in verse 13.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:49.140]   "And in the midst of the seven candlesticks I saw one like unto the Son of Man."
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.140]   Still the same.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:55.940]   He is still like unto the Son of Man, though he is back in the glory which he had before
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.140]   the foundation of the world with the Father.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.180]   But the wonderful statement is in verse 17.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:07.020]   "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead."
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.020]   Then listen.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:16.460]   "And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not."
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.380]   Do you get the significance of that?
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.660]   Well the significance of that is this.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.780]   Read your four Gospels and keep your eye on this.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.300]   How often did he lay his hand on people and say to them, "Fear not."
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.780]   That was when he was in this tent-like existence.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.780]   Well he tabernacled here on earth.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.340]   He was so compassionate, he was so tender, he was ready to stop and to help people indeed.
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.540]   "Fear not," he said.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.500]   He put his hand upon them to reassure them and said, "Fear not, it's all right."
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.020]   And this is the wonderful thing.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.020]   There he is in the glory.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.740]   "Clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle,
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.460]   his head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.700]   of fire, and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.540]   as the sound of many waters.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.940]   And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:15.300]   sword, and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.300]   What glory!
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.540]   Yes, but he's still the same.
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:27.660]   He laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, 'Fear not, he's the Lord of glory,
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:36.100]   but he's still the tender, loving, compassionate Jesus, who knew our fears and our apprehensions,
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.420]   and put his hand upon us and says, 'Fear not, it's all right.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.420]   I'm still the same one.'"
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.060]   Well, there it is.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:49.300]   And there are other illustrations of this as you go on through the book of Revelations.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.900]   You see, when the problem arises in heaven, who's going to be strong enough to open
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.780]   the book of history?
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.700]   And John wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.700]   to look thereon.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.460]   And one of the elders saith unto me, "Weep not."
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.460]   Why?
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.460]   Behold, who?
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.580]   The Lord of glory, the eternal Son.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.700]   No, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.340]   and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:20.600]   That's still how he appears, Root of David, offspring of David.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.220]   This is the one who, though he is eternal God, he's taken the manhood with him, and
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.220]   it is there.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.180]   Well, now let me sum it up by saying what our hymn has put to us so perfectly.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:35.700]   "Where I, the heavenly temple, stand, the house of God not made with hens, a great high
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:43.220]   priest our nature wears, the guardian of mankind appears."
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.700]   And here are some other consequences.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:50.860]   "In every pang that rends the heart, the man of sorrows has a part, he sympathizes
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.820]   with our grief, and to the sufferer sends relief."
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:03.780]   Our fellow sufferer yet retains a fellow feeling of our pains, and still remembers in the skies
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.700]   his tears, his agonies, and cries.
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.340]   So he draws this conclusion.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:15.860]   "With boldness, therefore, at the throne, let us make all our sorrows known, and ask
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:23.540]   the aid of heavenly power to help us in the evil hour."
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.620]   This is, I say, a most wonderful and glorious thing.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.140]   Have we realized it, my friends?
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.620]   As we ought to do.
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.540]   That God's love toward us was as great as death.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.620]   That it has in this extraordinary way made a difference even in the Godhead.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.060]   There is this manhood now in the Godhead.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.940]   The everlasting, eternal Godhead remains eternally the same.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:53.980]   God in three persons, blessed Trinity, from eternity to eternity.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.780]   The Incarnation made no difference to that, as it were.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.020]   The relationship between the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.420]   The Son, as we saw one Sunday morning, even when He was here on earth, refers to Himself
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.180]   as still being in heaven, because He is.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.740]   He is eternally there.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.780]   It is a great mystery.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.060]   We cannot understand it, but this is the teaching.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:19.460]   But this is the thing, that this manhood is also there now.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.740]   He took it unto Himself.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.580]   He took it back with Him.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:32.300]   And there in the blessed Trinity is this perfect manhood.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:39.540]   And that, I say, happened and that was done in order that you and I might be redeemed,
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:46.460]   that we might become the children of God, that we might have that permanent house in
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:53.540]   heaven, that we might become the children of God, and heirs of God, and joint heirs
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.620]   with Christ.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.220]   And then draw from it all the wonderful consolation.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:06.020]   Whenever you are in trouble and you go to God in prayer, you are conscious of your weakness
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.300]   and all the rest of it.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.660]   Remember, you are a great high priest.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.260]   He is there representing you.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.860]   He knows your sighs.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.580]   He knows what you are feeling.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.820]   He has been through it all.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.100]   He knew treachery from people whom he trusted.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.580]   Even all the disciples forsook him and fled.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.220]   He trod the winepress alone.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.700]   He knows all about these things.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.700]   There is nothing.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:33.700]   In every pang that rends the heart, the man of sorrows has a part.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:40.540]   He sympathizes with our grief and to the sufferer sends relief.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:46.100]   Well, I had intended going on, but I think it would be kinder for me to leave it at that
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.100]   for this morning.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.620]   Let us just leave it at those two points which I have made concerning him.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.740]   I was going on to talk about the result of his coming upon us.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.740]   I will not do so.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:01.900]   It is very difficult to know exactly what to do on an occasion such as this.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.940]   But I think that the kindest thing to you, good friends, is that we leave it just at
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.580]   that for this morning, that one great thought.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:19.520]   His coming meant for him a temporary change, a temporary result, his tent-like existence
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:27.500]   in this world, but it also meant that permanent result.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:35.420]   Man who is taken into the garden, elevated to the heavens, to the skies, there at the
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:44.220]   right hand of God at this very moment is this one who is everlasting God, but is also truly
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:52.260]   man, whatever your problems, whatever your difficulties, whatever your trials.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:29:00.620]   Never forget that he knows, he understands, he sympathizes, he is able to succor.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:08.260]   He is there representing us, seated at the right hand of God, ever living to make intercession
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.440]   for us.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.600]   Let us therefore turn upon the devil when he would try to frighten us and alarm us.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.920]   When we are conscious of the need of mercy, when we need grace to help in time of need,
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:30.800]   the answer is Jesus, the Son of God, is our great High Priest, and he will always be there,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.180]   ever living to make intercession for us.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:41.840]   May God bless this meditation to us and to our edification.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.880]   Now shall we join in singing the closing hymn 470.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   470.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:54.440]   Jesus, thy robe of righteousness, my beauty is, my glorious dress.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:13.100]   With flaming wells in this array, with joy shall I lift up my head.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:19.100]   470.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:35.100]   Jesus, thy robe of righteousness, my beauty is, my glorious dress.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:59.100]   With flaming wells in this array, with joy shall I lift up my head.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:07.100]   470.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:25.100]   Jesus, thy robe of righteousness, my beauty is, my glorious dress.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:49.100]   With flaming wells in this array, with joy shall I lift up my head.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:55.100]   470.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:19.100]   Jesus, thy robe of righteousness, my beauty is, my glorious dress.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:39.100]   With flaming wells in this array, with joy shall I lift up my head.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:47.580]   The only wise God, our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.580]   ever.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:54.700]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:33:00.580]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now, throughout the remainder
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:08.100]   of this, our short and certain tent-like existence, and evermore.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.100]   Amen.
