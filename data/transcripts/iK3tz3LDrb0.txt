[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   How do I know if the Holy Spirit is in me?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Very few questions are more important to ask, and all of us face this
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   question at some point. And it's a question asked even by pastors
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   too, like this one. "Dear Pastor John, greetings in the name of the Lord
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Jesus Christ. I am a pastor in Dubai. Can you tell me
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   how can I know for sure if I have the Holy Spirit inside of me?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I got saved at 8 and am now 33. I still
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   haven't experienced the power of the Holy Spirit in my life, not
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   demonstrably. I would really appreciate it if you could explain to me how to be
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   filled with the Holy Spirit. What does this look like?"
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Let's begin with a clarification. Our
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   friend is asking two very distinct
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   questions. And it's not clear to me
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   that he knows that he's asking two very distinct questions.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   So my first concern is to
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   make sure that he understands biblically that these are two very
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   distinct questions. His first question is, "How can I know for
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   sure if I have the Holy Spirit
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   in me?" Second question, "How can
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I be filled with the Holy Spirit?"
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Now, it is possible to be in a season of true
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Christian life and not be filled
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   with the Holy Spirit. And that's what I'm not sure he understands.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   But it is not possible to be a Christian
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   at all if one does not have the Holy
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Spirit dwelling within us. To be a Christian
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   is to have the Spirit of Christ.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Romans 5, 9-11, "You are
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   not in the flesh, but in the Spirit. If
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   in fact the Spirit of God dwells in
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   you, anyone who does not have the Spirit of
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Christ does not belong to him."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   So no one is a Christian if he does not have the Holy
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Spirit. Then in Ephesians 5.18, Paul
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   says to Christians who have the Holy Spirit—
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   and we know that, by the way, because in chapter 1 he said, "You,"
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   my readers, "you were sealed with the promised Holy
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   till we acquire possession of it to the praise of
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   his glory." Then he says in chapter 5.18, "Do
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery. But you
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Christians who are sealed with the Spirit and have the Spirit, be
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   hymns and spiritual songs, singing, making melody to the Lord with your heart,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   giving thanks always in everything, for everything
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus." In other words,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   being filled with the Spirit is a
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   level or a quality
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   of Spirit empowering that sometimes
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   is more and sometimes is less. For example,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   in Acts 4.31, it says that the Christians
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   had gathered for prayer, and when they had prayed, the
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   spoke the Word of God with boldness. So
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   one of the effects of this extraordinary,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   precious, sweet, powerful, unusual
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   is that we are more ready and free and bold in our
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   witness to Christ. Or, in Ephesians 5, more
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   ready, more free, more overflowing with psalms and hymns
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   and spiritual songs and giving thanks to God. So
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   having the Holy Spirit marks one off as a
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Christian. You can't be a Christian if you don't have the Spirit.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   There are no Christians who don't have the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Being filled with the Holy Spirit is what all believers should seek
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   to experience for the sake of the wonderful, Christ-exalting
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   freedom and boldness and power that
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   it brings. So how do you know
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   if you have the Holy Spirit, he asks,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   that you are, in fact, a Christian, I'm saying, that you
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   have been born again? Now, to answer this question
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   biblically, it is really important to know
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   the condition you were in
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   before you were converted. Unless you know
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   from the Bible—not primarily from experience, I'm not even
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   worried about people like me who can't remember when they were converted.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I mean, make that plain. I'm saying we must learn
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   the condition we were in before we were converted
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   from the Bible, not from our mother's memory or our
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   memory or anybody's testimony about how bad we were, but from
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   the Bible. From the Bible, we learn
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   what our condition is. Many people,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   thousands of people, have been badly taught
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   about the condition they were in prior to conversion,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and the biblical answer is this. We were
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   spiritually dead, Ephesians 2:4.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   We were unable to receive the things of the Spirit,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   1 Corinthians 2:14. We were in what Paul calls
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   "the mind of the fletch which is not able to submit
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   to God or please God," Romans 8:7. We did not have
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   the power to change our wills or our hearts or our minds
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   or our affections. We were bent entirely away
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   from God. How, then, did we receive
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   the Holy Spirit? It was a miracle. It was sovereign
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   grace, God's grace sovereignly applied
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   to us in our helplessness. "The wind blows where it wills,"
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Jesus says, "and you don't know where it comes from or where it's going.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And such are all who are born of the Spirit," John 3:8. A miracle
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   happened. The Spirit opened your eyes, Acts 16:14.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   God shone in your heart omnipotently
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   to cause you to see the light of the gospel of the beauty and the glory
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   of Christ, 2 Corinthians 4:6. He imparted
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   life. He gave you life so that you would no longer be dead, no longer
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   blind, no longer hostile to God, no longer unable to please God,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   no longer rebellious, no longer viewing the cross
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   as foolishness. Instead, you saw the glory
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   of Christ in the gospel. You saw it as more beautiful, more
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   desirable than the things of this world. You were alive
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   by the Spirit of God. God was real and precious and beautiful.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   You were no longer blind. You saw the cross
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and Christ in His way and His Word as more attractive than the promises
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   of sin. Instead of hostility to God,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   you loved Him and you wanted to please Him. Instead of doubt and suspicion
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   and hardness, you saw His promises as true and you trusted
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   in them, banked on those promises. Christ became your
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   treasure. That's how you know you're alive.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That's how you know you're converted. That's how you know you have faith.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   That's how you know that the Holy Spirit is within you.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   None of that would be happening if the miracle
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   of God's Spirit were not at work in you.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   But you wouldn't know that unless you had
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   been taught from the Bible how
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   dead you were, how utterly impossible all of this beautiful
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   transformation is apart from the sovereign work of the Spirit. Luke 18
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   and 27. If you have been taught that you were the
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   decisive cause—let me say this again now because this is incredibly
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   widespread and destructive—if you have been taught
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   that you were the decisive cause of
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   all of that, then you won't be amazed at your change.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   You will see it as decisively your work
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and therefore no real evidence that you are born again,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   the Spirit is within you. That's one of the great tragedies
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   for those who deny the sovereignty of God in salvation.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Ask yourself this. Are you amazed
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   at the sovereign grace of God that you wake up
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   every morning as a believer in Christ? Are you amazed?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   True saving faith is the
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   number one evidence that you are born again.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   1 John 5, 1. Everyone who believes
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   that Jesus is the Christ has been
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   born of God. That means born of the Spirit and
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   possessing the Spirit. So Tony, I think we need to stop here.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I know he asked how do you get filled. I haven't said anything about
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   that, but I think we need to stop here because his other question,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   "How can I be filled with the Spirit?" is just too big to
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   tack on here at the end. I think what we've touched on
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   here is really the nub of the issue. What
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   is the discernible work of the Spirit in our lives?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   What is the central biblical answer?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   It is he raised us from the dead
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and made Christ our supreme treasure.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Amen. Yes, we do need to stop here. We still have so much more to say.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Actually, we have said quite a bit more and taken up the filling question
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   elsewhere. See episode 972, "Am I quenching
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   the Holy Spirit?" That's episode 972. And see also
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   episode 1359, "What is baptism of the Holy Spirit?"
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Episode 1359. Both are related. 1359
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and 972 are related to this episode. We'll continue this
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   conversation forward that we started here. Find both of those episodes at

[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Well, how is the gospel connected to God's absolute
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   sovereignty? Are they connected? They are connected, inseparably
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   so. And millions of people in the United States and around the globe
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   over the past few decades have been waking up to this incredible connection.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   As Pastor John will explain next time. Don't miss this episode coming up.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
