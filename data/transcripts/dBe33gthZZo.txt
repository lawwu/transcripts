[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   It's pretty hard to overstate how the computer altered all of our lives.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.560]   And as I listen through old sermons, I'm struck by how quickly John Piper knew that
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.000]   they would, knew that the microprocessor would change all of our lives, bringing computers
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   into our homes and then eventually bringing smartphones into our pockets.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.980]   He saw the implications of this computer revolution decades ago, way back when he was shopping
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.080]   for his first computer in the early years of his pastorate.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.600]   He explains some of those implications in a sermon from the spring of 1984.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.920]   Our new digital powers would be bewitching, he says.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.020]   Our gadgets would take hold of our affections.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.980]   Computers would bring tremendous blessings to our lives, but they could also corrupt
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.960]   our hopes and our affections.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.500]   Here's Pastor John explaining how from 36 years ago.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.480]   Last Thursday, the day I usually take off, Noelle and I took about three hours out of
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.480]   our day off to go visit computer shops downtown Minneapolis.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.720]   Thought I would poke around to see if there might be some kind of word processing equipment
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.660]   I could someday afford, and it was an amazing experience.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.540]   My first foray into the big world of computer life.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.920]   Went to the library first and read the latest Consumer Reports on word processing, and then
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.240]   we visited four stores and came home with a big sack of colorful brochures.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.840]   Computers are like sex, I discovered.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.740]   There's something in us that they can hook into and hold onto.
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.060]   Computers are like a romance or an epic or an adventure which has come true right before
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.100]   our very eyes.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.620]   They combine mystery and power and precision and beauty.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.340]   They're exciting, they're new, they've got open-ended possibilities.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.500]   Our culture is going to be irreversibly transformed by the microcomputer revolution.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.260]   Every one of you will have one in your home by 1994 because prices are going to fall,
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.460]   the uses are going to expand, it'll be as common as the telephone, I don't doubt.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.660]   But for now, they are strange and wonderful things.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.120]   And one of the effects that they can have on Christians is to make Christians begin
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.540]   to feel that spiritual things aren't very real or exciting.
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.260]   They can't compare to these wonders.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.820]   You can touch a computer, you can see a computer, it'll talk back to you, it'll solve your
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.860]   problems instantaneously.
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.020]   It is a powerful fascination.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.860]   But the Bible speaks largely of unseen things.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.660]   They don't force themselves onto your senses.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.900]   They talk about things often way off in the past or way off in the future sometimes.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.900]   You've all experienced it, haven't you, with a new gadget or toy or appliance.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.540]   Either you bring it home or you come home with a bundle of literature all about it,
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.380]   literature half-read about word processing.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.780]   How easy is it to take it and lay it aside and with all your heart open the Bible and
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.540]   listen to the voice of God?
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.460]   Let me ask another question to put beside that one.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:48.940]   If you were laid low with kidney failure this week and a congested heart and were told by
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.740]   the doctor three days at the most, unless we use extraordinary measures and we don't
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.900]   think that would be wise, which would you prefer?
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.940]   Would you ask your family to sit by your bed and read the latest program developments of
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.300]   IBM or the Bible?
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   What's happened?
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.500]   What happens in those minutes after the doctor walks out of the room and leaves you with
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.340]   the imminency of your death?
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:29.340]   What happens to that gripping fascination of RAM, ROM, CPU, CPM, PC DOS, multicolor
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.500]   monitors and perfect writer and profit plan?
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.820]   What happens?
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.680]   What happens is that here at the end of your journey through the valley of life, the haze
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.740]   of the computer craze just gets blown away.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.180]   And all of a sudden you see, perhaps for the first time in your life, the lucid reality
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.460]   of the mountains of eternity just ahead.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.860]   You look back on that fog falling away into the valley and you wonder how you could have
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.660]   been so entranced, so captivated, so swallowed up in the mechanical functions of a man-made
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.420]   machine.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.180]   You look ahead and you see the spectacular peaks and the awful ravines and the unapproachable
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.780]   crags of those mountains and you wonder how that could have played such an insignificant
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.620]   role in your life.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:36.060]   But not only the mountains ahead, in this short distance that you have to traverse between
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.820]   your hospital bed now and those mountains, you look off to the side.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:49.060]   And on this side you see thick green grass and trees with luscious fruit and crystal
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:58.780]   streams and darting fish and a huge white dove hovering midair over it all.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:06.900]   Then you look to this side and you see a wasteland of half-eaten corpses and cracked riverbeds
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:16.620]   and dry ashes and lurking in the midst of it a huge, gaunt, hungry lion with his shoulder
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.220]   blades sticking up through his mangy fur and his big eyes looking you right in the face.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.500]   And all of a sudden in one immeasurable moment you discover what life has been really all
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.700]   about in the midst of all the hazes of computers and trinkets and toys and cars and houses
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.380]   and business.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:47.100]   The real issue of life becomes real clear, namely a battle for your soul between the
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.220]   dove who gives life and the lion who destroys.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.860]   So this morning I've come to proclaim to you that whatever has entranced you, whatever
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:05.340]   has captivated you, whatever enthralls you, if it dulls your sensitivity to the mountains
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:12.340]   of eternity, if it somehow encloses you with a haze so that you don't feel what is really
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:20.100]   at stake every day in your life between the lion and the dove, it's an illusion from
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.100]   hell.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:31.940]   I want us to see Christ in combat today so that our lives can be cleared away of whatever
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.740]   haze is blinding us to the combat that we face.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.580]   People sometimes ask, "If Satan is real, why do we see more demon possession and exorcisms
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.580]   in America?
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.540]   How come we just hear about that from Indonesia?"
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.460]   I've got an idea.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:56.180]   Satan holds American Christianity so tightly in the vice grip of comfort and wealth that
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.140]   he's not about to tip his tan with too much demonic tomfoolery.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:07.220]   What Satan fears most, Bethlehem, is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that causes you and me
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:16.580]   to say with Paul, "I count everything as refuse in order that I might know the power
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:27.180]   of his resurrection and the fellowship of his agonies becoming conformed to him in his
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.780]   death."
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.420]   Paul's statement is relevant for the smartphone age and for all the bewitching technologies
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.300]   of our age today.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.660]   This sermon was preached 36 years ago on March 18, 1984 in a sermon titled "Christ in
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.160]   Combat â€“ Defense by the Spirit."
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.620]   You can find it and listen to the entire sermon at DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.580]   Thanks for listening.

[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:11.500]   Well, I'm recording this in the midst of a pandemic shutdown of our cities and our
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   states.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.980]   I haven't gathered with my own church in weeks.
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.300]   But the next question on the docket is one about church dress codes, and I trust that
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.940]   we'll eventually gather together and be reunited again and dress codes will be an
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.200]   issue.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.980]   To prep for that reunion, we have a question up on how we should best dress for church,
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.980]   and it's a good one.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.980]   It's a good episode.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.980]   It's up next time.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.980]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:33.980]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.640]   Friday.
