[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well, about a month ago in episode 1105, we talked about the absolute sovereignty of God.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   That God is finally and decisively in control of everything from the farthest galaxy to the smallest subatomic particle
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   and to all the actions of human beings.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And we talked about how this transforms our daily lives.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   That was in episode 1105.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   But what if all this same theology works in the other direction?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   While the absolute sovereignty of God over all things seems to make some believers more energetic, ambitious, and determined to reach the nations with the gospel,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   this same sovereignty also seems to make other believers more apathetic, withdrawn, and passive when it comes to gospel mission.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   So what explains this difference?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   It's a question today from a listener named Brian who seems to find himself more and more indifferent in his life.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   He writes this, "Pastor John, I need your help.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   The deeper I think I understand God's sovereignty, the more it seems to fuel my own personal apathy.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   What is wrong with me?"
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Brian, let me sketch four kinds of responses to the sovereignty of God, and you see where you might fit in.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Then I'll tell you why I'm doing this.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   This might help answer the problem.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I'm assuming here that when we talk about the sovereignty of God, we are referring to his total control of all things,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   like the roll of the dice in every human game, Proverbs 16.33,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   or like the fall of every bird from the branches in the forest in every jungle in the world, Matthew 10.29, as Jesus said.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So that's my assumption about the definition of the sovereignty of God.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Now, there are two ways to reject it and two ways to accept it, and that's what I mean by my four ways of responding.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   The two ways to reject this are, one, reject the sovereignty of God because deep down,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   the reality itself as it really exists in the world is ugly or abhorrent to you.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   This is real rebellion against God.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So that's number one.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   The other way to reject the sovereignty of God is to have a conception of it that is distorted, unbiblical,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and thus see it as genuinely antithetical to a true biblical picture of God.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   So you can see the first way of rejecting the sovereignty of God is rooted in a deep-seated rebellion against God,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   while the second way of rejecting the sovereignty of God may in fact coexist with a humble,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   regenerate heart that for various reasons doesn't see the true biblical nature of the sovereignty of God
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   as it is taught in Scripture or perhaps has some distorted notions about other attributes that he's trying to make it fit with
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   so that they can't see God's sovereignty any other way than being at odds with the picture of God they have in the Bible.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I want to cut those people slack and say until they get their thoughts sorted out,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   they may be deeply humble and regenerate people.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Then, here are the other two.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   There are two ways of embracing the total sovereignty of God.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   One is to see it for what it really is as taught in the Scriptures and to love it and see it as beautiful
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   in proportion to all the other things taught in Scripture.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Not that every question is answered or every mystery removed,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   but according to the limits of our own understanding, the sovereignty of God and his other attributes are not contradictory.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Now, that in my judgment is the ideal way of embracing the sovereignty of God.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But another way of embracing it is to see that it is taught in the Scripture
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and to see some of its implications and to admit that this is in fact the truth that the Bible teaches,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   but to embrace it with a heart that's not fully docile or teachable or submissive to the whole counsel of God in Scripture.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   In other words, a person may be riveted on the doctrine of sovereignty while either being neglectful of other important biblical teachings
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   or maybe even indifferent to those other teachings or resistant to them.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   My human heart, your human heart, is very corrupt.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   All of us struggle with a kind of selective set of emphases in the Bible that we like more than others.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And we must constantly be humbling ourselves before the whole counsel of God
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   so that we are submissive to all that God teaches, not just some of it.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Now, I don't know Brian well enough to pass any judgment on where he fits into these categories.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And no doubt they're too simplistic to explain all the ways we relate to the sovereignty of God.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   But I mention them because it might help Brian if he asks whether he might be in this fourth category.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   That's my gut sense.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   In other words, he may be persuaded of the sovereignty of God as he sees it in the Bible,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   but his heart is not totally submitted to all of Scripture.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And there are emotional hesitancies that keep him from rejoicing over certain teachings.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I ask, why is it that some people hearing the news that God is sovereign over the battlefield
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   plunge in with great abandon and risk their lives for the cause of God and truth
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   precisely because he reigns, while others react with fatalism and lethargy and passively say,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   "Well, what will be will be and will be will be," and they don't go in.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Why is that? Why do people respond differently like that?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And my suggestion is that the passive, fatalistic, lethargic people have hearts
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   that are resistant to what the Bible teaches on certain other matters,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and this resistance keeps them from rejoicing over those teachings and being motivated by them.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And what I have in mind specifically, though others may apply,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   what I have in mind specifically are passages that explicitly teach us not to be passive,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   but active and energetic and hardworking and resolved to do good,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   not in spite of the sovereignty of God over our lives, but because of it.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   For example, and Brian, my encouragement is that when I read these texts,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   that you and all the rest of us pray, be praying that you would be thrilled by them,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   thrilled by them. That's what's missing, a being thrilled by the text that I'm about to read.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Philippians 2.12, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   because it is God who is at work in you to will and to work His good pleasure."
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   In other words, the sovereign work of God in us does not replace our working,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   it energizes our working. Do you love this truth, Brian?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Does that thrill you? That's taught in the Bible. It's true.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It's wonderful. 1 Corinthians 15.10, "By the grace of God, I am what I am.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   though it was not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   In other words, the presence and sovereign power of God's grace working in me
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   does not disincline me to work, but inspires me and empowers me to work.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Brian, when you hear this, do you rejoice? You say, "Yes, yes, that's a glorious,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   God-revealed biblical truth. I love that truth."
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Colossians 1.29, "For this I toil, struggling with all the energy that He powerfully works within me."
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   In other words, God's energy in Paul was experienced by him as a tremendous surge of his own energy.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And finally, 1 Corinthians 3.6, "I planted, Apollos watered, God gave the growth."
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   So, neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   He who plants, he who waters are one, and each will receive—are you kidding me?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Wages according to his labor, for we are God's fellow workers.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   You are God's field, God's building. In other words, God's decisive role in growing his church
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   inflamed Paul and Apollos to be about the planting and watering.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   So, my suggestion is that one reason why embracing the sovereignty of God produces courage and energy
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and humble, risk-taking love, and some other people experience it as apathy,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   my suggestion is that this dimension of biblical truth that I just read hasn't sunk in yet.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Either it hasn't been seen, which can't be said anymore, I just read it,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   or it has been seen and has not been thrilling for some reason.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   It's been resisted. And I would encourage Brian to pray over these texts until he is thrilled
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   by the prospect that God Almighty with all his sovereignty is going to work with Brian,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   in Brian, as Brian works by faith in him.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Yeah. Amen. May God's sovereignty thrill our souls and fill up our energy and ambition
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   in serving the good news of our Savior.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Brian, thank you for the honest question, and Pastor John, thank you for the response.
