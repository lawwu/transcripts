[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Yeah. I think a lot of people, like you mentioned, are prone to doing a really expensive
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.320]   sushi experience. Usually that will be omakase. I think a lot of us have heard the word omakase.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.560]   Really what that means is whatever you want. It's actually what you say to the chef.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:28.080]   Omakase, at your pleasure. What I would recommend doing before indulging in that is
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.800]   going to a kaiten sushi, going to a really inexpensive rotating sushi restaurant where
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   they'll have a little conveyor belt and different things are going to come in front of you. It's
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.720]   going to be very inexpensive. Take the opportunity to try a few things before you go to the higher
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.760]   end restaurant because as things go higher end, it verges into delicacy territory where you are
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:09.920]   going to get a lot of fish sperm or raw octopus, things that have textures that aren't familiar to
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.320]   the Western palate. I would exercise your palate before you go because you don't want to not eat
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.280]   something in front of the chef that is cooking right in front of you at his "pleasure".
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.160]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.040]   money, and travel. If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins. One of the areas I love
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.920]   optimizing the most is travel. I've been to 60 plus countries and on every trip, I love meeting
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.880]   locals, trying to understand their culture, having authentic experiences, and most of all, I love
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.320]   finding a way to eat all the best foods a place has to offer. Hands down, one of my favorite travel
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.680]   destinations in the world is Japan. I wanted to do another travel episode on just traveling there.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.000]   While I've been there four times, there is no one better to join me than my previous guest,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.040]   Brandon Presser, who's been there every year for the past 20 years except 2021,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.600]   including spending a month there last November. He's also lived there twice and he's written
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.760]   three books on the country. He is a true expert on Japan, but he's also been to over 100 countries
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.880]   and written well over 50 guidebooks, so he is actually an all-around travel pro as well.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.040]   We're going to talk about why we both love the country so much, what makes it worth a visit,
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.600]   where you should go, what you should see and do, and my favorite, all the incredible foods you
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.000]   should be trying and our favorite spots to eat them. I hope that by the time you finish this
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.720]   episode, whether you've never been to Japan, have a trip on the horizon, or have been before,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.320]   you're going to be inspired to go there soon and have a ton of amazing new things
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.840]   to check out when you get there. So let's get into it right after this.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.640]   Brandon, thank you so much for being here a second time.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.920]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.600]   You've traveled to so many countries. What is it about Japan that keeps bringing you back?
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.160]   So the thing about Japan for me is that the more time you spend there,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.240]   the more you realize you don't know the destination that well. And every time I go
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   back, there's always a new thing to explore. There's always a theme that needs unpacking.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.560]   And it's one of those places that it's not like New York where you get to live there for 10 years
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.400]   and then you get to say you're a New Yorker. The more time you spend, the more you're like, "Wow,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.840]   I'm not from here." If that makes any sense.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.040]   This is crazy. This is coming from someone who's lived there twice and been there
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   well over a dozen times. So that's wild. What do you think? What is so different about Japan?
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:49.440]   I've heard a lot of people call Japan a Galapagos economy. And what that essentially means is that
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.040]   it's a country that has modernized and evolved away from the rest of the world. A lot of the
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.000]   systems that are in place, a lot of the ways that we perceive the modern world are just slightly
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.160]   alternate universes. I think that's what makes Japan so interesting and special.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.840]   Can you give some examples?
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.960]   Absolutely. I think one of the most important things to note about Japan and Japanese culture
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.760]   is that they have this proclivity for taking something from another country and then improving
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.800]   upon it. Ramen is the best example of that. It's a Chinese dish, became really popular after World
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.840]   War II, was called Chinese noodles. Then the recipe started to change and started to evolve.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.760]   Then it became ramen, which we all conceive of as distinctly Japanese. The other example is
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.680]   toilets brought by the West. And as many of us know, they now can sing you happy birthday while
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.880]   you're using them and have all sorts of water features. I have a Japanese. We've talked about
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   how to get a deal on a Japanese toilet on this show before. So and I totally agree. It's funny.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   I've been to Japan a few times and people are like, oh, you got to check out this place for
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.680]   pizza. And I'm like, why would I get pizza in Japan? You're all the way. It seems crazy. It's
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.800]   like, no, no, no, because Japan takes everything and tries to make the best possible version you
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:27.600]   can of it. So there is a pizza place in Pizzeria Napoletana Daiyuki in, I think, Kyoto. And the
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.920]   person who started it went to Italy, trained, brought back everything and has tried to master
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.440]   the pizza in every way possible. And the same is true about coffee. And like the list goes on
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.880]   forever. Whenever my wife and I come back, we're like, I feel like we just came back from the
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.560]   future, like in this world where everything was improved and thought of in a rational and logical
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.640]   way. So I am so excited to dig in here. I'm so excited to go back to Japan. You know, you are
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.320]   one of the people I know who's been since it reopened. What was it like in a kind of post
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.920]   pandemic world? Well, much in the way that Japan always feels like this wonderful trip to the
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.360]   future. And I often, when I return from Japan, have sort of reverse culture shock. When I get
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.040]   back to the U.S., I'm like, oh, this country is so disappointing relative to Japan. What was
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:27.120]   interesting about my trip to Japan this time was it felt a little bit like a visit to the recent
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:35.760]   past. Their relationship with COVID has been very different than in the U.S. Everyone is still
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.680]   masking, even outdoors, even on a hike. I would pass people who are still wearing their masks
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:49.360]   outside. And we can kind of dig into why that is and how certain cultural things kind of inform
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.920]   that. But there is a lot of COVID fear. When I was there, a lot of people asked me,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.800]   is this your first trip out of America since the pandemic? And, you know, I think Japan was
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:09.040]   maybe my 15th country since we've, you know, torn away the veil of the pandemic.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:18.880]   So, in that sense, it was this odd revisiting of the trauma of the pandemic and the fear.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   But what's also really interesting about Japan is we're now post-Olympics. That is something to
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:35.360]   really consider, as well, because it was sort of the Olympics that never happened. There were high
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:44.080]   hopes for the Games the last time that Japan had the Olympics was in 1964. That was really fascinating
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.960]   because it was the first Olympic Games that were televised around the world. It was to signal that
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:56.800]   Japan was this fresh, newly modern country, post-World War II, a lot of really interesting
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.160]   modern architecture happening as the backdrop. So, they were kind of hoping to replicate that magic,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.360]   and of course, that never happened. But how the Olympics actually are informing
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:15.280]   Japan is we're seeing a lot of little Western tweaks. English is a lot better than it was a
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.520]   few years ago, and we're also seeing much more credit card use than we did before. Little things
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.880]   like that. Things are open. You are able to go see stuff, do stuff, eat stuff, drink stuff. So,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:33.600]   just because, you know, there might be a feel like you're back in the past, I would say was still,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.360]   you know, you could go to Japan right now and have an amazing experience and do all the things
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.400]   you'd done before. Absolutely. I highly recommend it. If you're okay still wearing a mask, out of
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.240]   courtesy, I would get on the plane tomorrow. You're going to have an absolutely incredible
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.880]   experience. Everyone's excited for people to be coming back. Restaurants are fully operational.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.160]   If you saw in the news a lot of travel articles that were like, "Go before the crowds! Get back
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:07.600]   to Japan before the crowds!" That's fake news. The crowds are back in full force. Chinese
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.560]   tourism are going to start heading back now as well. Even without the Chinese tourists who make
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.400]   up about 40% to 50% of the tourism in Japan, everything was rammed. You know, all the favorite
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.880]   temples in Kyoto were packed with people. You absolutely needed reservations at popular
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.000]   restaurants. So, everything's back in full swing. Well, let's talk about that trip. When I did my
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.200]   first episode to London, I just picked a city. I was like, "Oh, that's pretty easy. I'm getting a
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.760]   little ambitious here. We're going to talk about an entire country." So, instead of trying to go
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.440]   through every destination in the country, that would be impossible. We would have to record for
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.120]   the next week, or based on your experience, maybe for the next 20 years. Let's say someone's
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:57.200]   thinking about how to take that first trip for one or two weeks. What would you give them the
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.400]   advice of how to go, where to go, all that? I would think about trip planning to Japan
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.920]   the way that I think about trip planning to every destination. Think of your trip as a meal. Think
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.520]   about you have your appetizer, your main course, and your dessert. The appetizer is like you're
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.400]   getting into the vibe of the destination. You're doing a little sampling, maybe tasting a few
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.800]   things. Really, you're getting over the jet lag. By the time you transition to the main course,
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:34.320]   that's the real showstopper. That's the meat. The dessert is going to be the thing where you
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:43.840]   really treat yourself. Save that really fun, cool thing until the end. I'm not someone who
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:52.080]   suffers from FOMO, but I am crippled by the optimizer's dilemma. I want to make sure that
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.400]   I've had the best trip possible for me. Japan is one of those places where there's just so many
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:05.280]   different variations on the theme. I think the two places that you absolutely have to hit
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:14.240]   are Tokyo and Kyoto. Then, you can mix and match a variety of secondary destinations based on your
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:20.640]   personal interest. I wouldn't be a slave to, "Well, everyone else is going here," or "Everyone
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.760]   else is going there." Think critically about what is interesting to you about Japan.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:34.240]   We're going to go through some of those different destinations and themes and pick a mix from there,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:42.560]   and then end with your splurge, where you're really soaking in maybe a traditional inn, a ryokan,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:49.360]   and having that quintessential Japanese hospitality experience where you're not
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:56.480]   leaving the hotel, but just basking in that incredible design, food, everything that we
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.920]   know from the country. Hospitality.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.000]   That omotenashi. Yeah.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.680]   Just high level, what are a few of those places? We'll talk details about them, but just to give
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.920]   people an idea of where we might go in this conversation outside of Tokyo and Kyoto that
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.160]   you'd put on the list. Maybe even say, "Oh, if you're this kind of person, it might be this,"
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.280]   or, "If you're looking for this."
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.440]   Yeah. I would think that you would want to get four elements on your trip.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:29.680]   You want to do new, old, mountain, sea. Those are the four things that I think that you should
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:36.080]   check off your list for every trip to Japan, whether it's your first or whether it's your
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:46.560]   fourth. Old and new can be in different cities. They are always looking ahead into the future,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:53.600]   while also cherishing their cultural and historical relics. Then you need to remember
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:01.120]   that Japan is on the Pacific Ring of Fire. There are still active volcanoes. The country is
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:10.880]   incredibly hilly, mountainous, and then you have these beautiful sea moments, bays, lakes.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.400]   Putting that all together is just perfect.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.120]   Are there specific places you're like, "We'll get to them, but here's a cool place,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.240]   there's a cool place," to just get people excited?
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:31.280]   Well, think of Japan as having four major islands. Tokyo and Kyoto are on the main island,
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   Honshu. I would absolutely add one of the other islands to your itinerary. Kyushu in the south,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.800]   you're getting active volcanoes. You're getting onsen culture, this hot spring culture.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.920]   This is a really hot emerging destination that I absolutely recommend. I can give you some
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:58.000]   specifics a little later on. Shikoku is the quietest of the four. These are small villages,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.720]   a lot of farming. That's where you're going to really have that rural experience where you can
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.800]   go stay with a family and really embed in the culture in a very different, humble way.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.360]   And then you have Hokkaido in the north. If you think of Japan as a lowercase J,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:23.440]   Hokkaido is the dot at the top. That is really famous internationally as a skiing destination.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.200]   I would challenge you to consider it as just a beautiful, natural destination and a place that's
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.920]   really worth going even in the summer for those mountains on steroids, these huge expanses of
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.360]   wilderness, but still with that Japanese sensibility. I love it. Okay, we're going
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.600]   to get to a lot of this. I'm very sad that I don't have a Japan trip on the horizon.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.440]   Best times, is there a time you think people should be planning their trip to Japan?
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:15:00.000]   Yeah, that's a great question. I like to avoid the summer. That is not necessarily because that's
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.160]   when you have the most crowds, but surely a lot of people on their summer holidays are going to
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:10.480]   end up in Japan. But it is desperately humid. When I used to live in Japan and I worked,
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:19.440]   my boss used to make me keep clothes at work so that after I would take the metro to the office,
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.920]   I would have fresh clothes to change into because I would inevitably be sweaty.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:32.400]   July and August are upsettingly hot and humid. And so much of Japan, even though you're thinking
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.760]   about taking trains and all of this, so much is exploring by walking. So, you want to be
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.000]   comfortable. Obviously, there's cherry blossom season that's world famous, and you're going to
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.560]   get all of the crowds. Is it worth the hype? Absolutely. It is totally stunning. There are
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.720]   cherry blossoms all over the country. You don't necessarily need to be in Tokyo or Kyoto to see
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.240]   them. My favorite time to go is in the fall. Because in the way that cherry blossom season
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.800]   is revered, so is the fall. And Koyo, as it's called, leaf peeping. So, you get these beautiful
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.640]   red Japanese maples. I think November for me is my favorite time to visit.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:17.440]   Yeah. We went in December with my family right before the 2019, right before COVID came. And
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.760]   it was awesome because it wasn't that crowded, but it's not that cold. We didn't go to Hokkaido,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.520]   it would have been cold. But in most of the rest of the country, it's not unbearably cold. So,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.120]   it was a little cheaper because people aren't traveling in cold cities as much. But that was
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.600]   another... I had a great time. It was a little easier to get into things. It wasn't that crowded.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.560]   Any other high-level logistics? Do you think people need a guide?
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.120]   Someone wrote to me and I'll ask you and share my opinion. But they're like,
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.920]   "Should they be nervous if they only speak English?" Anything like that?
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:01.120]   I think that the English has massively improved over the last 10 years, especially with the
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.200]   anticipated nudge of the Olympics. There were a lot of people that were taking English classes,
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:12.960]   and that has really changed. Does it compare to other countries? No. I think that there's still
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:20.240]   a lack of English compared to a place like Thailand, say. But I think you are going to
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.800]   be fine going around on your own. I think experiencing at least parts of your trip
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.040]   on your own is hugely rewarding, much more rewarding than in a lot of other destinations,
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:38.640]   simply because the quality of everything is so high that it's a destination that really lends
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:46.640]   itself to discovery. Walking into a random restaurant, it'll probably be pretty darn good.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:54.880]   We've done Japan four times. I speak three words of Japanese. We had no guides ever any of those
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.840]   times. I typically tell people, "Look, you might need to speak a little slower. You might need to
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.800]   point. You might need to just accept that you'd just be surprised." But I don't think there's
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.520]   a country in the world that I've found that you can't go to because you don't speak the language.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.680]   So I don't think that should be a barrier for anyone. But I've gotten a bunch of emails asking
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.040]   if it is, so I wanted to make sure we cover it. And last, any tips you have since you've
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.800]   been there so many times to save money on setting everything up in advance?
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.520]   Well, there's two things that I always think about when I'm planning a trip
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:36.080]   to Japan. I think we all want to do a bit of pre-arrival research for some of our specifics.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.800]   It's a country that is very crowded. It's a country that's getting a lot of tourists,
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.720]   so you do want to plan a little bit in advance as far as what you're going to eat,
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.640]   where you're going to stay. One of the things that's very culturally different than Japan and
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:19:03.040]   the West is rating things. Giving stars on Google or on Yelp or things like that. In our culture,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.920]   we're very hyperbolic. We have a nice experience, we give it a five. We have a bad experience,
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:15.040]   we give it a one. Everything always ends up netting out to be like a 4.2 or something like
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:22.080]   that at a place. In Japan, you have a nice experience, you give it a three. What can be
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.160]   really confusing at the onset is someone could tell you, "Oh my god, I love this restaurant.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.840]   It's so great and cool." And you go on to Google to see the review that has been given and its
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.440]   average is like a 3.6. And you're like, "What? I would never eat at a place that's a 3.6."
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:48.720]   Well, in Japan, 3.6 is excellent. And in the food category, I want to send you right away
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:57.360]   to Tabalog. It's a website that is their Yelp, but it's taken very seriously. People use it
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.040]   prolifically. And with your translator button on, you can navigate it without any problems.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.120]   And you can search by type of food, and you can search by destination, and really make some
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:16.080]   informed decisions bearing in mind that really stellar restaurants are going to have like a 3.8
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:24.160]   or a 3.7. And then, you can also use the rating to gauge where Japanese people are going and where
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.560]   tourists are going. And this goes for other things like hotels and sites and bars. If it has a low
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.520]   score, you know Japanese people are going there. If it has an inflated score, you know that it's
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.120]   more frequented by foreigners. You find a place on Google Maps,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.720]   it's like 4.9. You're like, "Steer clear. There's no way I got here."
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.280]   Exactly. Don't go here. Only Americans are going there.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.880]   Yeah. Oh, that's so funny.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.120]   What about other things about the culture that people might want to know about going there? How
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.360]   would you describe Japanese people and the culture and things people should be aware of?
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.520]   I want to take a beat to talk about how we would relate to Japanese culture. A lot of people talk
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:10.560]   about how the Japanese hospitality is like no other, and there's this notion of emotinashi,
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:17.600]   which is service from the heart. I hear that buzzword a lot in luxury travel when I work with
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.240]   different hotels all over the world. They want to telegraph that they have this elevated sense
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.720]   of hospitality. What you need to understand about Japanese culture is when you engage
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:37.200]   with a product, a hospitality product, there's an unspoken social contract where you are also
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:46.400]   the deferential guest. The idea of the customer is always right doesn't really exist in Japanese
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:58.160]   culture. You are expected to be as well-behaved and as nice as the restaurant staff will be to you.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:08.320]   That is kind of a product of Japan being a culture of shame rather than a culture of guilt.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.880]   In the West, we think about Catholic guilt or Jewish guilt. I think we all have a pretty good
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.600]   sense of what that means if we have all experienced it. In Japan, it's more how
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:28.080]   everyone else is perceiving you. You are kind of internalizing your own actions and making choices
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:33.200]   about your behavior based on how everyone else perceives you rather than that moral compass
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:42.240]   inside telling you what's right or wrong. I know it's a bit lofty, but you are working as a guest
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:50.000]   in the way that staff are working to serve you. We were at a nice steakhouse in Tokyo once. I
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.200]   remember, I think my wife, but I could be wrong, one of us spilled our glass of wine on the table.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.640]   We'd been in Japan for a week and we had internalized this feeling you're describing.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.840]   It was like, "Oh my gosh, should we just leave the restaurant? Can we even stay here?" We felt
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:11.920]   so horrible. Everyone was looking at us like, "How could you do that?" I feel like I know what
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:18.400]   you mean. Fortunately, we recovered. We apologized profusely and it was okay, but I have experienced
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.680]   that feeling and it's very different. Yeah. You don't want to be late. You don't
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.440]   want to be late to your reservation. You don't want to be late to meet your guide.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:36.480]   That's part of the social contract as well. Also, you might find funny quirks where if you're
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:41.360]   staying at a luxury hotel and the staff wants to know what time you're going to have breakfast in
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:47.200]   the morning, you could say, "Oh, I don't know, 9am." But they might come back to you and say,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:56.080]   "8.30 is better." Don't be surprised if they are going to really hold you to that social contract
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.680]   and tweak your experience, but it's all so that they can serve you better.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.920]   They're suggesting 8.30 because at nine, it's crowded and you might not get the best table or
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.960]   your food might be slow or something like that. On the sense of punctuality, definitely don't
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.240]   be late to trains either. I can't remember the story, but it was like there was one train
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:23.840]   that left seconds late and they issued a national apology. I'm sure you know this story better than
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.720]   me, but things are not late. Yeah. When I lived in Japan, I was
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:38.640]   working there and going to the office on days when a train would be late, by more than 10 seconds,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:46.160]   they would issue you a little white slip of paper, if you needed it, that you could bring to your boss
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.600]   saying, "This is the reason that I'm late. It is not my fault that I am late to work."
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:57.760]   Everything is extremely on time to the point where I've had tourists reach out to me,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.200]   friends reach out to me at Tokyo Station wanting to get on the bullet train.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.520]   They had bought tickets for their 9.30 bullet train to go to Kyoto, let's say.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.080]   They're like, "I'll get to the train station 20 minutes before," but of course, Tokyo Station is
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.720]   one of the biggest stations in the world. It takes about 20 minutes to get to your train
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.640]   and they missed it. Last thing on the cultures,
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.920]   is it easy to meet people? I think one of my favorite things traveling is meeting locals.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.080]   I find in Japan, either I'm doing it wrong or it's harder to do.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.440]   It's extremely difficult. It's extremely difficult, again, because I don't want to
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.560]   oversimplify the nuance of cultures of shame versus cultures of guilt. There's certainly
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.960]   nothing that we need to unpack more than that when we're trying to cram in a whole
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:52.800]   travel guide in about an hour. But the idea is that because this social contract that you have
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.120]   with the people around you, it extends beyond hospitality. It's why everyone is so polite on
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.880]   the trains. It's why everyone walks on certain sides of the roads. It's why Tokyo is the biggest
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:11.280]   city in the world, but it feels more organized than any other city half its size. The social
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:19.200]   contract exists that you create this facade, this emote, where you have a side of yourself that you
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.920]   present to other people. Then you have a more personal side and a more personal aspect to your
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:33.280]   personality. Because there is this facade element, you are engaging with people in that manner.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:40.480]   Is it a fake facade? No. Are they two-faced? No. This is a true aspect of your personality,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:46.800]   but it's the presented aspect of your personality. It's hard to have that very American,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:54.400]   "This is how I really feel about something. These are my real emotions." Americans like to tell you
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.000]   when they're mad, but they're screaming at you. It's like, "Yeah, I get it that you're mad because
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   you're yelling." Whereas the Japanese generally are much more nuanced in that nature. It's an
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.600]   interesting moment where two cultures are touching that may feel limited or inauthentic, but it's
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.840]   just a different version of how we present ourselves. I imagine if you had a guide or you
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.480]   met someone that worked at your hotel and you're like, "Hey, do you want to grab a drink tonight
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.080]   after work?" Would that be very surprising or shocking and met with a no? How might you go
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.760]   about introducing yourself to a local so you could get to know them and spend time in a casual
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   setting? One of the things that I've discovered is there's actually a lot of opportunities to
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:48.320]   engage with people in structured ways that could end up leading to a friendship. A lot of towns
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:57.200]   all over Japan, including Tokyo, have free tours that you can sign up for. Those tours are with
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.520]   young Japanese individuals who are motivated to take you around their neighborhood as an
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:09.520]   opportunity to practice their English or an opportunity to meet foreigners. There are a
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:15.360]   lot of different websites that offer this, and it's a great way to strike up a conversation
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:23.200]   with someone and use that tour opportunity to ask big questions because they are people that
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:31.440]   want to engage with you. You can use it less as, "Oh, I want to discover Shibuya in Tokyo and see
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:38.160]   cool things," but more as an opportunity to have that budding friendship opportunity. I would
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:44.000]   definitely try to do one of those. I love free walking tours. I think they're a great way to
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.840]   get your bearings, but especially in a culture where it's harder to meet someone just at a bar
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.560]   and strike up a conversation, I think it's a great recommendation. You mentioned a few things in
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.760]   Tokyo. I want to make sure we get to what to do. I think let's start here because I assume almost
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.720]   anyone going to Japan, especially on their first trip, will end up here. It's one of the most
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:09.040]   amazing cities in the world. How do you think about even trying to bring it all together and
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:14.960]   suggest people experience it? One of the funny things that I've noticed about Tokyo is when you
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.520]   ask people where they're going on holiday, when they're referring to a European destination,
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:26.480]   they usually refer to it by place, by city. "Oh, I'm going to Paris on holiday. I'm going to
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:33.280]   London." When people talk about going to this country, they say "Japan." They don't say "Tokyo"
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.360]   for some strange reason. I'm always trying to figure out why. I think it's because it's so far
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:45.920]   and it's a lot of people's first time they're going to do things beyond Tokyo, which makes
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:52.800]   perfect sense. But I really want you to spend more time in Tokyo than you think you need.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.320]   A trip that's three nights in Tokyo and three nights in Kyoto doesn't make sense to me. It's
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.400]   a city that has 40 more times the population than Kyoto. It's a city that's four times
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:12.320]   physically bigger than Kyoto. Even just on pure numbers, you shouldn't weight Tokyo equal to
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:19.120]   anything else in the country. It's a place that has a Brooklyn. Sure, do I need to go check out
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:29.840]   the Brooklyn? Sure. But there's like 12 Brooklyns. It's just this infinitely large destination in all
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:37.440]   the best ways. It can be really tough to dig in. My first thing that I always tell people when
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:45.680]   they're trying to figure out the city is to Google Yamanote Line Google Maps. Don't go into Google
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:53.200]   Maps and Google it because it won't work, but just go to your Google search bar and type Yamanote
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:59.840]   Line Google Maps. There's a bunch of people that have drawn the Yamanote Line within Tokyo. That is
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:12.880]   a Japan rail line that makes a circle around the central part of Tokyo. Tokyo has 23 wards,
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:19.440]   which are kind of like boroughs. This line is a really good way to conceive of the city
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:28.240]   geographically. Now, think of that as a clock. Everything that when you hear that's like cool
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:36.800]   new neighborhood, street fashion, even going back to the early 2000s, Harajuku girls and all of that,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:46.960]   that happens at around 7 to 9 o'clock on the clock. Then all of the older things like Shitamachi,
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:57.360]   all of the Sensoji Temple, a lot of the older touchpoints happen around 1 and 2 o'clock
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:04.160]   on the clock. Then you have the big, big stations like Shinjuku is at 9 o'clock,
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:13.440]   Ginza, which has Tokyo Station just north of it, also a major hub. That's at like 3 o'clock.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.760]   That's a good place to start thinking geographically about the city.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:23.120]   Also, I will say, if you don't look at the Yamanote Line and you look at the entire subway
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:29.840]   map, it's just like a sensory overload. It's very hard to understand. There are multiple companies
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.480]   operating different rail lines in the city. In some cities, I'm like, "Oh, look at the
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.440]   subway map. It's a good way to orient yourself." In Japan, I love the recommendation of just
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.360]   starting with the Yamanote Line because otherwise it could be pretty overwhelming.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:49.600]   Totally. It really looks like fallen confetti in a way. It's all different colors.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:56.400]   What's curious about it is that unlike other cities, it is built from a few different companies.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:03.200]   So you have some municipal lines, the Tokyo Metro line, then you have a second metro line,
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:10.000]   then you have suburban lines that were built from companies like a Sears or a Macy's.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:18.080]   Strangely, they share names with a lot of the department stores in Tokyo. You're going to use
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:25.600]   one card to tap through many turnstiles if you're going to go on a long trip all the way through
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.360]   the city. 20 years ago, you used to have to get tickets for each one, which was an absolute
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.400]   nightmare. Yeah. So now, I believe it's still just the Suica card. You used to have to get
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.880]   a physical one. Since we won't go too much into travel logistics because it's pretty straightforward
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.280]   and the internet is full of information, I will just add that you can now get your Suica card on
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.920]   your iPhone or your phone in a digital wallet and you don't even need the physical card.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:55.120]   And you can reload it right there. It's super easy. I will say if you're on a budget,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.440]   it is worth paying attention because I think it still is true. Correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:06.240]   that if you transfer from the Toyosu line to the JR line, you're going to pay multiple fares.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.200]   So it is worth... When you do a Google Maps search from A to B, it'll tell you how to get
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.680]   there and show you the prices. And there might be a fast route, and there might be a cheap route,
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:21.920]   and they might be different because changing different lines may be on different companies
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.480]   and have multiple fares. That's a really good point. It's something that I think about when
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.960]   I'm there as well. Yeah, if you're really focused on your budget and you're traveling, say, from the
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:38.160]   central part of the city to Shimokitazawa, which is a really trendy sort of perennially cool
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:47.760]   neighborhood, if you get off one station before Shimokitazawa at Yoyogi-Oehara, you save about
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:53.600]   two-thirds of the fare. Yeah. And Google Maps is pretty good as a... I don't know if there's a
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.120]   better app, but to find... Train from point A to point B, I believe it also tells you the fares
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:05.840]   and everything. So that's what we use. So we're still in Tokyo. I don't even know how we possibly
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.960]   get through all this, but I would love to leave people with some suggestions in the buckets of
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   things to see and do, things to eat, maybe some nightlife. Any thoughts on how we even start to
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:23.520]   make a dent here? Yeah. So when you look at the subway map, it's just an "Oh my god, I don't know
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.840]   how to deal with this. This city must be so massive." You can walk through a lot of the city
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.440]   and don't be allergic to walking. What I love to do on my first day back in Japan
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:45.280]   is a triangle from Omotesando to Harajuku, and then down to Shibuya and back again. You can do
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:52.560]   that triangle. And that's a really fun day. You can take it super slow. And what you're getting
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:00.480]   in that area is a lot of the key touch points of the city. You're getting a lot of the sort of
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:08.640]   rodeo drive shopping. Shopping in Japan, especially in Tokyo, is a social activity because there's
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:16.240]   such limited public space and people have such small apartments. Shopping is sort of a hanging
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:24.560]   out endeavor. This is a really major thoroughfare, Omotesando Dori, to do that. Off of that are
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:31.840]   little boutiques and barber shops and really cool things, those stores that we wish we all had in
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:39.360]   our hometowns. And then you go all the way to Harajuku, the kind of bombastic hip-hop meets
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:47.600]   little boat peep that still exists. And right beyond that is the Meiji Shrine, which is absolutely
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:53.280]   worth a visit. And then you kind of turn down and go to Shibuya. We've all seen on Lost in
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   Translation or in other movies, the Shibuya Crossing, the busiest pedestrian crossing
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:05.200]   in the world. And then you can triangle your way back to Omotesando again.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:14.960]   I love going to one specific restaurant. It is hugely popular with everyone. It is very well
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:22.400]   known. It is worth the hype. It's called Maisen. It's tonkotsu, so a breaded pork cutlet. It's
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:30.160]   1,100 yen, which currently is about $7. For a full meal, you're going to have to wait in line.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:41.360]   And it's in an old onsen, so an old bathhouse that's been refurbished. You could start with
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.720]   that. It's very close to Omotesando Station. And then spend the afternoon walking around or do the
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:52.480]   morning and end with lunch there. Bearing in mind that if you want to go into shops, they tend to
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.640]   open a little later than you would expect. So 11 o'clock, you'll have all the stores open.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.680]   Yeah, I asked my wife. I was like, "What are some of your favorite tips?" And she's like,
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.760]   "Walk everywhere so that you burn enough calories that you can have four meals a day."
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:13.440]   Absolutely. And I think what's really fun is Tokyo is not an expensive city.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:18.640]   Everyone talks about how it's so incredibly expensive. It's like New York or Paris.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:24.240]   It is not expensive at all. The food is bizarrely inexpensive. Where you're going to get dinged is
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:34.480]   on accommodation. So if you want to avoid lines and you're really into the food, do a first lunch
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.760]   and a second lunch at weird times so that you don't have to wait in those lines. Do a 10.45
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:47.520]   first lunch and then a 2.45 second lunch. And that way, you'll keep things pretty efficient.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.280]   I do that all the time. And I will say there are a lot of places,
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.480]   especially if you're going for ramen or something that's not a make a reservation kind of place,
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.880]   where you just wait in line. That's just the way it works.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:05.520]   And the easier it is... You're not going to get tables, by the way, if you're going with a big
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.600]   group. A lot of these places, you're not going to sit down with six people at a lot of these
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.320]   small restaurants. And so you just line up. I remember it's like two people went in and
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.960]   ate together and then one person ate together. It might not be the most social meal when you're
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:23.040]   going to some of these small restaurants, but it will probably be one of the most delicious meals.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.960]   And one of the other things to keep in mind, especially in Tokyo,
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:32.560]   is don't be allergic to a chain restaurant. If you Google a restaurant that had been recommended to
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:40.240]   you, like a ramen place or a gyoza place, and you see like, "Oh my God, they have six locations.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:46.480]   I feel like I don't want to really do that." Don't be dissuaded by a chain. The chain is
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:55.440]   usually because hospitality spaces are so small. They can only serve eight people at a time,
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.120]   and having a second location just enables them to serve more people.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.800]   Also, the city is so big that if people are traveling an hour to go to their favorite ramen,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.440]   while suddenly they have a location for it closer to them, it's usually a sign that something's very
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.960]   good rather than it being very corporate. And while we're on food, I've got some of
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.600]   my favorites. We can get to a few of yours. What are a few things, dining etiquette,
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.640]   tipping, anything there that you want to give people some overview?
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.680]   Yeah. You absolutely don't want to be late to your reservation, as we kind of unpacked before.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:39.920]   I would really scout Tabalog if you want some good food recommendations from Japanese people.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.520]   There is absolutely no tipping. This isn't even a question of if someone's doing something nice
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:55.680]   and they're particularly good to leave them a few yen. No, it is a non-tipping culture to the point
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:02.480]   where oftentimes, at least in the past, it could be perceived as rude because you're sort of
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   insinuating that this person needs more money. I think we may conceive of server jobs as being
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:13.360]   interstitial, like, "Well, I want to be a singer, but I'm a server right now."
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:20.640]   People bring a certain devotion to their jobs in Japan, whatever they are. And so,
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:28.320]   people are lifelong servers or restaurateurs. So, you absolutely don't want to tip.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:35.040]   And what about meal times? I know that in some French culture, it's normal. Sit down for lunch,
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.160]   sit there for a few hours, relax, watch the people go by. I feel like in Japan,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.400]   and you're the expert, but I've had meals... And you said it's not expensive.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:49.440]   Just to be clear, there are also very expensive restaurants. You can go to Japan and have a very
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.000]   delicious meal every day for every meal for a month and not spend that much.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:01.120]   You could also go to Japan and spend a ridiculous amount of money. But I've had the fortunate
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.760]   pleasure of going to a Michelin starred sushi place and had dinner in less than an hour.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   I would say Japan's not a place to linger after you've eaten a meal,
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.440]   in my experience. But I assume you would second that?
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:22.960]   Yeah. And I would say also, not to harp on this idea of this social contract,
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.720]   but if you're eating at an inexpensive restaurant, if you're going for ramen,
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:36.640]   or if you're going for a gyoza or one of those beef bowls, it's sort of like when you're done,
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.400]   you go. If you have an empty bowl in front of you, you're sort of no longer welcome.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.680]   Some places will actually give you a time. I have definitely been to restaurants where they
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:56.240]   say, "You have one hour starting now to eat." And it's not meant to be rude. It is part of that,
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:01.520]   "Well, we want to provide you the best service, and the person before you took only their hour.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:07.840]   So now you are also only going to take your hour." There are venues that are where you go and
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:16.160]   socialize, izakaya, so bars that have bar food. It's a lot less structured. You go, a lot of times
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.240]   you don't need to make a reservation. They have an empty table. You sit down, you drink, you eat a
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:25.280]   little, you drink, you eat a little, but everything is very segmented. I would think of dining in
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.480]   Tokyo and in Japan in that manner. I think in the United States, we have a lot of restaurants that
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:37.840]   are pan-Japanese. You can order sushi, you can order oyakodon, you can order udon, you can order
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:43.360]   all these, maybe even Thai food at the same restaurant. This is the opposite. Every restaurant
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:49.440]   in Japan usually has one thing that they do exceptionally well, and they do it maybe 10 ways.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:58.000]   So you're going to a soba restaurant, you're going to a udon restaurant, a tofu restaurant.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.800]   And so everything is much more specialized and specific.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   If we went through, we could probably go through a long list, but are there some
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   maybe off the beaten path types of food specialties or culinary experiences where
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.000]   it's like, "Go seek out a place that has great X, Y, or Z"?
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.040]   Yeah. I think a lot of people, like you mentioned, are prone to doing a really
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:27.920]   expensive sushi experience. Usually, that will be omakase. I think a lot of us have
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:34.160]   heard the word omakase. Really, what that means is whatever you want. It's actually what you say
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:44.720]   to the chef. Omakase, at your pleasure. What I would recommend doing before indulging in that is
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:53.440]   going to a kaiten sushi, going to a really inexpensive rotating sushi restaurant where
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:58.880]   they'll have a little conveyor belt and different things are going to come in front of you. It's
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:07.280]   going to be very inexpensive. Take the opportunity to try a few things before you go to the higher
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:14.400]   end restaurant because as things go higher end, it verges into delicacy territory where you are
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:26.480]   going to get a lot of fish sperm or raw octopus, things that have textures that aren't familiar to
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:32.880]   the Western palate. I would exercise your palate before you go because you don't want to not eat
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.840]   something in front of the chef that is cooking right in front of you at his "pleasure".
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:45.360]   Yeah, that's a great recommendation. Okay, so maybe in the interest of time,
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.920]   are there a few favorite things, you'd say, favorite restaurants that you'd recommend
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:56.640]   people put on a list? I'm sure there's plenty. Gosh, yeah. So, ramen is a big question. I get a
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:03.840]   lot of people wondering, "I want to do a ramen meal while I'm there." Well, ramen is everywhere
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:09.120]   now and we have really good ramen in the United States. So, rather than going to the Ippudo
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:14.960]   Mothership, even though we have Ippudo here or the Afuri Mothership, I would recommend trying
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:22.240]   something a little more offbeat. I love Kagari ramen. It's in Ginza. They have two locations.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:31.200]   It is a chicken ramen. It's a very creamy chicken broth. Describing it does not do it justice.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:37.680]   It's so good. I've been there. It's so good. It's unreal how good it is. And why I like that
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:43.120]   is because you cannot get that anywhere else. It is a ramen experience in a ramen place,
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:52.000]   but it is something truly elevated that you will have a hard time finding when you return home.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.480]   Yeah, the other place I'll throw out is Kikanbo, which is known for spice. It's a spicy ramen
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:05.680]   place. You actually pick your ramen on two tiers of spice, both chili hot spice and the
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:11.920]   sansho pepper spice, which is kind of like a Sichuan peppercorn with that numbing spice.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:18.560]   It's my favorite restaurant in all of Japan. And I'm sure if you don't like spicy food,
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:23.440]   it would not be your favorite. There's also, and this is maybe overhyped, but
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.760]   Sukumen, like dipping ramen, which it's popping up at a few places in the States,
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:35.200]   but it's kind of a different style of eating ramen. And Rokurinisha in Tokyo Station
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.000]   always has a line, but is, I think, fantastic for trying that out, especially if you find
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.120]   yourself at Tokyo Station with some hours to kill. Yeah, and you know, again, in the idea where I
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.920]   said that kind of picking a chain is counterintuitive, eating at a train station seems
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:57.760]   counterintuitive as well. But you have to remember that there's a massive commuter culture in Tokyo,
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:05.200]   and a lot of these small businesses under Tokyo Station or in and around it are catering
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   to commuter crowds or businessmen at lunch. So, some of the best quick eats, you could build it
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.840]   into your itinerary. If you're like, "I'm going to catch the bullet train to Kyoto at 1 o'clock,
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:26.480]   go to Tokyo Station at 11.30, go get gyoza at Min Min in the basement, and then try one of the
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.400]   ramen places. They even have incredible French pastries. Pick one of those and then get on your
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:38.000]   train." Great tip. The same, I think, is true about department stores. I feel like the food
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.520]   court in a big department store or shopping center is not, you know, in the U.S., it's like filled
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.240]   with the fast food, the Panda Express and the McDonald's. I've had some amazing meals at
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:53.840]   department food courts, department store food courts. Department stores is one of those things
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:59.600]   like a toilet that was brought from the West and then vastly improved when it touched down
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:05.360]   on Japanese soil. You're going to see in the basement of a lot of the department stores,
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:11.680]   they have these huge, huge food courts. It's not what you think of like a mall food court. It is
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:19.600]   all of these artisanal stalls peppered throughout with incredible fare. A lot of that food that
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:26.160]   you're going to find down there is both for an elevated lunchtime snack, but it also speaks to
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:34.720]   a culture of omiyage. Omiyage is gift giving, something that you're going to buy for your
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:41.360]   family when you get home, if you're on a holiday, or if you're going to meet someone at their house
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:47.600]   for dinner. We all bring a bottle of wine or something like that, but in the way that tipping
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:55.520]   is necessary in America, omiyage is necessary in Japan. You're going to go down there and find
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:03.360]   these beautifully wrapped cookies. It's omiyage to go. If you are going to engage with local
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.760]   individuals, let's say you're going to take this free tour, one of these free tours we've been
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:16.720]   talking about, bring them omiyage. Bring people you meet omiyage. Buy keychains from your hometown,
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:22.800]   or something like maple syrup if you're Canadian, or something that you can travel with,
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:30.880]   or go to a department store and buy these omiyage. You'll go much further than other
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:37.280]   tourists as far as accessing local culture. I love that. Any other food tips before we move on?
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:44.640]   I think in the way that... This is like the optimizer's dilemma. I love Japanese food,
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:50.560]   and it's such a broad category that all I want to do is eat Japanese food while I'm there.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:56.640]   But man, oh man, the best pizza in the world is in Tokyo. I know that sounds blasphemous, but
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:06.240]   Savoy in Azabujuban is my favorite pizza place on the planet. It's Neapolitan pies.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:14.240]   It is incredible. I highly recommend it. I would think about trying other types of food while
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:21.200]   you're there after you've had your Japanese fix because they just do it so dang well.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:27.280]   One of my favorite restaurants, totally under the radar, please, let's all keep this between
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:35.760]   ourselves, is Tama. It's Okinawan food. You're still getting aspects of Japanese culture,
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:40.560]   but you're seeing how it blends with Taiwanese influence. If you look at a map, it's much,
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:48.240]   much closer. Okinawa is much, much closer to Taiwan than it is Japan. So you're going to see
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.280]   how both cultures inform the cuisine. Tama is very close to Shibuya. Very small restaurant,
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:59.600]   super friendly staff, big smiles. Just tell them, "Omakase." Just tell them, "Bring me some stuff."
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:06.640]   That's great. The two other ones I'll leave. There's a punk rock itsukaya called Tatamichiya.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:13.280]   I'm going to butcher this name. Tatamichiya. I'll put it in the show notes. It's just such a cool
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:20.800]   spot. It's good food, good vibes. For me, just playing cool music. My wife and I almost go every
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:26.640]   time. And the other is going to be a crazy one. But you'll probably hear lots of people tell you,
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:32.320]   "Go to 7-Eleven and just try all these different crazy snacks." They have in these little plastic
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:37.920]   bags, pancakes. And their pancakes are somehow created. They have all kinds of flavors filled
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:42.080]   with red bean, filled with this. But they actually have a pancake that's very Americanized, which is
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.240]   filled with maple syrup and a little bit of butter. And you can put it in the microwave at 7-Eleven
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:53.600]   and heat it up. And I don't know how, but these plastic bag pancakes might be the most delicious
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:59.760]   pancakes on the planet at a 7-Eleven. So, one, just go to 7-Eleven. There's so many crazy things.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.960]   I've heard the egg salad sandwiches are delicious, but not my thing.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:11.440]   I could write love poetry to those egg salad sandwiches or tamago sando. And I was going to
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:17.440]   say the convenience store, the konbini culture is really fascinating. And to save time, we'll link
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:21.520]   to an article that I wrote about the 10 things you need to buy at a konbini at a convenience store.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.480]   I fully recommend digging in.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:30.400]   Awesome. That's so great. Okay. Everyone can go look at one of the many guidebooks you've
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:35.360]   probably written and say, "Oh, go to the Imperial Palace. Go to the Meiji Shrine." That kind of
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:40.800]   stuff. What are some of your favorites that maybe aren't on the top 10 list?
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:48.960]   Well, there are a lot of opportunities to climb a tower and see the cityscape from high above.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.000]   Absolutely worth doing. Do not pay to do this. If there's an opportunity where you need to pay
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.640]   to get in an elevator, don't pay. The Tokyo Metropolitan office is in Shinjuku. You can
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   go to the top for free. It's rammed with tourists. My recommendation would be to go to a high-end
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:12.480]   hotel. All of their lobbies are lofted over office buildings, and you can get a cocktail in a much
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:17.760]   more relaxed atmosphere and have that city view. The New Four Seasons in Otemachi, I think, has the
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:23.920]   best view of the Imperial Gardens. Right behind it, on a very clear day, usually in winter,
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.840]   you can see Mount Fuji. There is no better view amongst the luxury hotels right now.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:37.280]   Now, as far as more off-the-beaten-path things, you're going to exit the Yamanote line. You're
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:43.760]   going to take one of the spokes off of the wheel that are on the suburban rail lines,
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.520]   and you're going to want to go to neighborhoods like Shimokitazawa. You're going to want to go to
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:55:01.120]   Kichijoji or Daikanyama. Another popular one is Nakameguro. I even like Geogauka,
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:07.520]   which is even further. These are more neighborhood-y, so a mix of small,
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:15.360]   traditional houses, and then some newer builds. Everything really crammed together. Little stores,
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:23.440]   boutiques, mom-and-pop shops next to more corporate things. I know that I just rambled
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.560]   off five different neighborhoods. Write them down. Give them a Google. You're going to find
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:38.320]   everything that you want in those. There's a really good donut shop just beyond Shimokitazawa
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:45.840]   called Haritsu that is in what seems like a little tea house, but they serve very modern donuts.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:51.920]   Give that a whirl. I promise you won't be disappointed. I'll throw one out. I think
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:57.680]   they're always changing, but there's a company called TeamLab that does these really interesting,
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:03.280]   immersive experiences. We did Borderless and one other one. I can't remember. Maybe Planets.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.680]   I don't know which ones are running now. It seems that there's always one in Tokyo.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:14.560]   Highly recommended. Kind of wild, interesting, immersive art with lights and maybe sounds,
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:20.240]   maybe textures. They're always changing, but those were so awesome that we went to one,
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.000]   and the next day we were like, "We have to go to the other."
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:31.120]   Yeah. I'm a huge fan. I went to one right before the pandemic and did it twice in that day. I was
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:37.040]   like, "I need to have the whole adventure all over again." It's very sensory, a lot of textures,
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.840]   playing with light. There's water. You do want to dress appropriately for the one that you have
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:49.120]   to walk through water and with pants that you can easily pull up. Highly recommend that as well.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:57.280]   That's out in Odaiba. Odaiba was created in Tokyo Bay using garbage to build man-made islands.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:04.000]   Even though it's an indoor thing, you actually should plan that on a very nice day. Once you're
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.920]   out there, it's really nice to walk around and take in the city from out there. It's this
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:15.760]   pleasure island, Vegas-esque destination with a lot of really cool outdoor stuff.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.400]   While we're in that direction, do you have a strong opinion on whether people should be going
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:24.880]   this ... I'm going to butcher it again, the fish market. Let's just leave it at it.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.480]   Tsukiji. It's no longer in Tsukiji. The fish market-
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.360]   But it's still, if I remember right, it's still that direction, right?
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:38.960]   Yes, it is. It's further out. Tsukiji is the biggest fish market in the world.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:50.240]   Then it moved to a bigger location in Toyosu. In the remains of Tsukiji are still a lot of little
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:58:00.640]   fresh fish, sashimi, sushi restaurants and bars. As far as wanting to do the fish auction and
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.280]   different things like that, that's something that you need to talk to a private guide about.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:10.560]   They all have different kinds of access. They all have different opinions on it,
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.480]   how you want to leverage your jet lag to get up in the middle of the night to go see it.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:20.880]   I think Tsukiji is really close to Ginza. It's walkable to Ginza if you want to go check it out
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:29.200]   and try that intro sushi that we were talking about before. There's a chain of sushi called
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:35.840]   Sushi Zamai. They're really famous in Japan because the owner is this Colonel Sanders character,
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:41.680]   come to life, who always famously makes the biggest bid at the fish auction. He always
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:47.600]   buys the most expensive fish of the year. There's a lot of locations all over Tokyo.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:55.440]   That's a really good place to do your intro to more adventurous sushi and sashimi.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:01.040]   A couple others for me, the Design Sites 2121 Museum, I thought was really cool. Obviously,
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:07.920]   it's a museum, so exhibits change. I'm dying to get your take on recommending Robot Restaurant.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:15.920]   There's a lot of different themed restaurants all over Japan and Tokyo. Once as a wink,
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:21.840]   I went to the Ninja Restaurant for my birthday one year. It was super fun and cheesy.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:32.400]   Of course, you know what you're signing up for. I shy away from the "Japan is weird" trip.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:42.400]   I don't think that you're getting a lot of true insight. I think it would be akin to going to a
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:50.960]   baseball-themed restaurant in America or something that is taking a piece of Americana
[00:59:50.960 --> 01:00:00.240]   and hyperbolizing it. It's all just for show and for giggles. That's not really my vibe.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:05.920]   You could design an entire itinerary of "Japan is weird." In the Akihabara neighborhood,
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.680]   there are these things called maid cafes, where all the cafes have a different theme. You go,
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:17.440]   and your server takes on a role. There's one where you get to play the older brother,
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.720]   and she plays the younger sister. There's one where you get to be the prince, and she's the
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:31.600]   princess. That is culturally curious. It might be a little bit hard to access if you don't have
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:40.640]   Japanese, but I don't love doing something for the sake of zoo-ifying culture.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.240]   Almost every memorable experience I have skews on the authentic side of eating at a small place
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.800]   with amazing food or going to see something interesting. I don't disagree.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.840]   That's my soapbox moment for the episode.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:04.880]   If your stay in Tokyo aligns with one of the sumo times of year that sumo wrestling happens in Tokyo,
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.080]   I think that's an interesting experience. It's a very specific time. It's not like baseball,
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:16.240]   where there's a game every week. Absolutely. That is in the eastern part
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:21.600]   of the city, beyond the two o'clock, three o'clock, if we're talking about the clock map.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:28.000]   Ryogoku is that area. Again, this is something that you want to enable with a private guide.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.360]   I don't think you want to do the zoo aspect. I think that there are ways to engage in a more
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:41.280]   culturally curious manner. I would honestly avoid the Skytree, which is also out in that
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:48.080]   part of town. It was built to economically stimulate that area of town, which is a bit
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:54.880]   older and not as modernized. It's just a big tower in the sky with a bunch of shops around it.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.400]   It's pretty far from where you're going to be staying, likely, because I would recommend
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:07.520]   trying to stay a little bit closer to the six to nine o'clock part of the clock.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.120]   It's just not worth the schlep. Let's do some quick hits on drinks,
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.920]   whether it's nightlife or coffee. I'll do mine first to try to keep the speed going.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:24.000]   There's a really cool coffee shop called Deus Ex Machina. I can't remember the neighborhoods,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.960]   but you can Google it. I'll put it in the show notes, which is one of our favorite coffee shops
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.880]   in Tokyo. For drinks and stuff, my favorite bars, I'm just going to list them,
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:44.240]   are Bar Trench, Bar Tram, and Bar Benfidich. What anything in the coffee, tea,
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:51.120]   nightlife area, since we're way over time? I would go to Naka Meguro, which is a very
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:58.960]   cool neighborhood. That's where they have a massive multi-story Starbucks reserve that you
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:09.200]   walk by and ogle at the fact that there's a 90-minute wait to get in. Then, you go up the
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:16.080]   street to a place called Breakfast Club, which is this Japanese version of an American diner
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:27.600]   run by these two cool DJ guys who just have this really cool breakfast all day every day
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:40.000]   vibe with diner coffee. It's just so much fun. I love going there. Great music. Breakfast meets
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:51.920]   bar. I think as far as coffee goes, I made the mistake of putting it in The Lonely Planet about
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   12 years ago when I was working on the Japan Guide. But in Shimokitazawa, you want to go to
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:06.560]   Bear Pond, a little hole in the wall, massively popular. Do not try to take a photo. They will
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.800]   be mad at you. But excellent espresso. Any thoughts on nightlife? I feel like I'm
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.920]   past my nightlife prime, other than getting some good cocktails. Anything you want to add
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.280]   to that category? Back in the day when I was a student,
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:29.200]   the metro stops at around 1 and then starts back up at 5. At 12.50, you're like, "Okay, guys,
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.120]   are we going home or are we going out all night and getting on the 5 o'clock train?"
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.240]   It usually meant going out all night and getting on the 5 o'clock train. Back then, 20 years ago,
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:48.320]   it was Shibuya and Roppongi, where the big club place is. That's changed and evolved.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:56.240]   Shibuya has had a love hotel seedy side to the back of Shibuya that is evolving right now. It's
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:01.600]   becoming a much more commercial and wholesome destination. There are a lot of new hotels that
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:09.200]   are going in, high-end hotels. If you want to give something an interesting try, I would try
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:21.440]   a multi-course cocktail, if you're really into cocktails. I'm very happy with a highball or
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.640]   like a whiskey on the rocks. If you're a cocktail person, there are a handful of different
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.960]   cocktail restaurants where you're doing four cocktails over a couple hours and each one is
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:38.000]   very different and they're paced as though you're having a meal. Just like we talked about pizza and
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.480]   coffee and everything, taking cocktails to the next level, there are some of the best cocktail bars
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:50.800]   and cocktails in the world in Japan. I feel like you could pick anything and just say that and it
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:55.440]   would probably be true, but I have a lot of personal experience on the cocktail front to
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:02.000]   say that it is true. There is this through theme also of intentionality. Every business owner
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:11.120]   brings this incredible intentionality to their products. Ben Fittich is incredible in that way
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:17.680]   where the bartender is making everything involved. I've been to restaurants where
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:25.760]   the chef is even making the silverware that you're using. This incredible intentionality
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:31.600]   just permeates food and beverage. If you are a cocktail nerd, a mixology nerd,
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.120]   you're really not going to find any other better cocktails on the planet.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:40.080]   I completely agree. I have two questions. One, I don't know the answer to. I didn't have kids when
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.800]   I went. You've written guidebooks, so I'm sure you've had to think about this. What's the vibe
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:50.320]   like with bringing kids, bringing them to restaurants, that kind of stuff in Japan?
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.200]   It's a really good question, especially because it's a country that we always see in the news
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:04.240]   that is shrinking in population. There are not a lot of kids out and about. Also, how do you bring
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:13.200]   a kid who's very young and how do you control their behavior to abide by that social contract
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.720]   of being a good guest in different places? Well, not everyone is expecting your three-year-old
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:25.680]   child to be perfect. Do you take that person to a $300 omakase? No, because you're not bringing
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.880]   that person to that $300 omakase at home, either. I have seen, because of the pandemic,
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:38.640]   maybe a lot more green spaces opening up. There's a beautiful walk that you can do
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:46.240]   in Shimokitazawa now. They buried the track between three stations, and now that has been
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:54.000]   turned into really cool walking paths and gardens and shops. I would try to keep kids more in those
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:04.640]   areas. There's a lot of dining in that manner, where you can eat out on a patio,
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.480]   and then it's a little bit less intense to have your kids.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:15.840]   I will say, from all of my experiences in Japan, it's lots of walking, moving around,
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:20.640]   eating four meals a day. It would have been hard to do the kind of experiences I've done with kids.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:26.000]   I'm sure there's a different itinerary for a family-friendly trip, but I think for us,
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.160]   we're just like, "Hmm, maybe we're just going to wait a few years until the kids are a little older."
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.440]   Not saying it's impossible, but I know the kind of Japan trip we love having,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.160]   and I feel like we might not get it if we go with infants and toddlers.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.200]   I agree. I don't want to discourage families from booking a family trip to Japan, but I would say
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.960]   the trip that you think you want to have will be difficult to execute with a toddler.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:56.800]   Yeah, especially if that is cocktails and lots of street food and that kind of thing.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.240]   We're going to maybe get there with time to the other things you could do in Japan.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.240]   And relaxing, you could certainly do a lot of that.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.760]   So, we've got to move on. Is there any last thing in Tokyo that we didn't mention or you're like,
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.160]   "I've got to share this"? Even if it's such a secret that we keep it out of the show notes.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:23.200]   Well, I do have one ultra-favorite restaurant. I've probably celebrated about 10 birthdays
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.000]   in Japan, maybe 15. And many of them have happened at that restaurant,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.040]   but you're going to have to DM me on Instagram for the name of it. Sorry.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.040]   Ooh, I like it. I like it.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:40.480]   It's a yakitori restaurant. So, it's fish and vegetables, chicken and vegetables, rather,
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:48.080]   on skewers. Small place, great vibe, incredible drinks. But yeah.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.120]   Got to keep it. I was going to say, I was going to call this your best guest secret,
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.600]   and you're literally going to keep it a little bit of a secret from the episode.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.160]   We'll link to your Instagram in the show notes. I think it's just @brandimpressor.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.440]   @brandpress. Yeah.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.960]   We'll link to your Instagram in the show notes. It's just @brandpress. But I appreciate that.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.400]   I'm going to send you a DM. Okay. There is an infinite amount of things that we could keep
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.520]   talking about in Tokyo. To go back to what you said earlier, I feel like every time we go to Japan,
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.760]   there are some countries where you'd come for your next trip and you'd skip
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.200]   the main city because you've been there before. Every time we're like, "Let's go back to Tokyo,
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.320]   there's so much more to uncover." But we've got to move on. You said there's two places that
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:38.000]   everyone should consider going. It's Tokyo and Kyoto. How do you think about Kyoto being organized
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.080]   and to the extent that's helpful? Okay. So, the first mistake that people make
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.680]   when they're doing a trip to Japan and they do Tokyo and Kyoto is they think Tokyo, new,
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:53.920]   Kyoto, old. Big mistake. You're missing so many cool things in Tokyo by only focusing on the new,
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:11:00.720]   and you're missing so much of the essence of Kyoto by only focusing on the old. That's places of
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:06.880]   worship and castles and stuff like that. The other mistake that people make with
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:13.680]   Kyoto is that because they have old in their brain, they want to stay at a traditional inn.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:22.080]   Part of staying at a ryokan is that you're going to be served dinner and you're going to be served
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:28.400]   breakfast and it's all about fostering relaxation. It really seems antithetical to the time that
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:34.320]   you're going to spend in the city, which is going to be just as excited about getting around and
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.160]   seeing all the temples and seeing all the cafes and experiencing the culture. So, I would leave
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:47.520]   that traditional inn, that ryokan experience for the countryside and not marry it to your
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:56.160]   Kyoto experience. Now, happy to indulge in all the oldness that is Kyoto. It is the ancient capital.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.440]   It is an incredible city with some of the oldest cultural relics that remain intact in the world.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:10.080]   But at its core, it's also a place of learning. It's a college town. It's much, much, much smaller
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:16.880]   than Tokyo. There's a thriving student culture there that is well worth tapping into. That's
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:24.880]   tea shops. That's cafes. That's really cool clothing stores and boutiques. That's getting
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:33.440]   into handicrafts and these old family businesses. You should absolutely pick a handful of temples
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:39.040]   that you want to see and appreciate that culture. But a lot of people treat those temples the way
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.160]   that people in Europe treat a church. They go and they're just like, "Wow, opulence. The cathedral.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.920]   Super cool." Without delving too much into the history aspect of it all. It's okay if you're
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:56.880]   allergic to, "Oh, this temple was made in 1636." That's fine. I'm kind of allergic to that as well.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:05.760]   But just make sure to bear in mind to have a broader experience in Kyoto than you might expect.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.880]   You're going to see a lot of people walking around in traditional attire.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:17.040]   A lot of people come back from trips to Japan and they say, "Oh my god, I saw a geisha in Kyoto."
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:25.360]   You did not see a geisha. You saw a Taiwanese traveler who rented her kimono for the day and
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:30.160]   they dress you up. This is a really popular thing for Korean, Singaporean, Taiwanese
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:37.040]   travelers to do. The geisha culture that you hear about from members of a geisha in Gion,
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.840]   one of the geisha districts, is much more behind closed doors.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:47.760]   And is that something that there's a way to learn, appreciate, and experience and understand it? Or
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.400]   is it kind of one of the few things that is hard for Westerners to be a part of?
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.680]   This is something that you're going to have to plan while in advance. This is something that a
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:04.080]   lot of people have gained access to over years of building relationships. There are pricey,
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.320]   personalized luxury experiences where you can go spend time with a maiko, like a geisha in training
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:18.160]   or a geisha, and have a really mind-expanding experience about what that culture looks like.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.120]   I mean, it is on the decline. It's not what it was a long time ago. This is
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:29.360]   something a bit of former glory. But it is still there for you to consume. But the best way to do
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:35.840]   it would be to pick a luxury travel planner and book that experience through them as a one-on-one
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.920]   experience. Yeah. And this is something that we didn't mention earlier when we talked about
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.600]   restaurants. But I find that unlike many places in the world where it's just pop up, open table,
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:50.960]   make your reservation, search online for book a tour, there are still a ton of restaurants and
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:57.840]   experiences that if you don't have a travel planner or a higher-end hotel concierge, you just
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.400]   can't do. Is that the experience you've seen? Or is there another way to access some of these
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.880]   restaurants or experiences? No, that's pretty much right. And as someone who cut their teeth
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:15.200]   writing guidebooks for Lonely Planet, I am all about trying to enable as many opportunities
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:23.040]   for travelers and readers on their own that I can, but a lot of these things are guarded.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:30.400]   So, you will need a luxury travel planner who has made 20 or 30 years of inroads in the destination,
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:39.440]   who forged that relationship with the Geisha house to make that happen. So, if that is something
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.400]   that's a priority to you and you want to have the real experience, you are going to pay for it.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:50.320]   I'll caution people. One option is, if you do want to have one of those experiences and
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:56.800]   either book through a luxury travel provider or at a higher-end hotel, you don't have to do it
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.160]   the whole time. So, I tell people there are some restaurants that are very difficult to get a
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:06.800]   reservation at without a high-end travel organizer, concierge, or hotel, but you could book one or two
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.960]   nights at that hotel. We'll talk it... I was going to say at the end, we may be talking a bonus
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.480]   episode about how to do that with points, and then line up some of those things that you need
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.760]   support from, and then you could move to another hotel that's not as expensive if you don't.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.720]   Keep all that in mind. There are an unlimited number of great restaurants experiences you can
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:32.160]   have without that, but for anyone listening who's trying to have one of those coveted or higher-end
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.760]   exclusive experiences or dining at a three Michelin star restaurant, it's not as simple
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.440]   as just going online and booking. Yeah. I should say on background, too,
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.360]   I was in Japan right as everything was shutting down in 2020. The reason that I was there
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:54.400]   is I was doing a very intense audit of all of the hotels in Tokyo for Conde Nast Traveler,
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:17:01.120]   all the ones that were opening up in anticipation of the Olympics. Of course, that was completely
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.600]   curtailed, and my editor was like, "Get home! Get home! They're closing the borders!"
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:14.160]   When it reopened, I went back to complete that audit. I stayed at dozens of hotels in Tokyo,
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.120]   and my editor, when I got home, she was like, "OK, Brandon, what did you see that was different
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.800]   than before the pandemic?" I said, "Well, you know what? It's that all of these hotels now want to be
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:35.360]   the purveyor of your experience." In all of this time, hotels were really hurt during the pandemic,
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:40.480]   so they're trying to find different ways to bring in more revenue. A lot of hotels are doing
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:47.520]   really compelling F&B, food and beverage, bringing in locals to eat at the restaurants in case the
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:55.360]   tourism dwindles again for some unknown reason. The other thing that's happening is hotels are
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:02.480]   offering tours. I'm not talking about the group tour thing where a bunch of you are going around
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:11.600]   with a flag. Hotels like Amman in Tokyo have a secret concierge service where they will take you
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:19.920]   to local artisans to have personalized experience where they will cut you kimono and yukata robes,
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:27.360]   or they will hand etch chopsticks for you, or you can do fan design. These are all exclusive
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:34.000]   opportunities that Amman offers. All of the hotels are getting into this. Even if you cringe
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.360]   at the idea of having a travel plan or one of those travel services, squeeze out a little bit
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.560]   more from your concierge at these high-end hotels because they want to give you more than just a
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:53.600]   room. Lewis: I would say Amman is probably at the top of the mark, but we've stayed at the Hilton,
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:01.440]   which is not near Amman prices. But at a lot of the very big established hotels at that level,
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:08.800]   there are still incredible concierges. The Hilton concierge was able to help with a number of
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   reservations and activities that would have been much harder for me to do myself. Obviously,
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.760]   some of the more exclusive things might be catered or offered at the higher-end hotels
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.400]   like the Amman, but I had a ton of success at even just the Hilton Tokyo.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:32.080]   Lewis: Totally. Back in Kyoto, one of the things I mentioned in Tokyo, my first day I like to do a
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:38.720]   triangle to connect three little areas. For Kyoto, my thing that I always do when I go is I rent a
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:45.120]   bicycle. I usually cheat and rent one of those electric ones that helps you along the way.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:56.960]   Kyoto's very hilly. It's hemmed between two mountains, in a way. It's very different than
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:02.480]   Tokyo in that it's very low-lying. A lot of Japanese people say it's very European.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:09.840]   There's a river that flows through it, but because traffic is much less and everything
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:16.400]   moves a little slower, it's really easy to get around on a bicycle. Just remember that you're
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:24.320]   on the left side of the road. It's a great way to explore. Because it's such a small city relative
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:34.800]   to Tokyo, it's really hard to get lost. You can go up and down different streets,
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.720]   you can pop in and out of different neighborhoods, and you're never going to be
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:42.240]   woefully far from your hotel.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.600]   Lewis: That was the first when my wife and I went -- I don't even want to say this -- over 15 years
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.800]   ago to Japan for the first time. For her, the first thing we did was we rented a bike from the
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:58.480]   train station. We just set our bags. I don't even remember if it was a day trip. I don't remember a
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:03.120]   lot of how the logistics of that happened. But I do remember we rented the bike right at the train
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.360]   station and went and explored. I think we came back and got our luggage because we had a late
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:14.000]   check-in. I love that. I'm sure if in the Lonely Planet for Kyoto, there's top 21 experiences that
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.640]   you should have. Let's skip those and maybe share some of your favorite things that people should do
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.480]   or see or eat or anything.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:28.560]   Lewis: Yeah. One of the things I guarantee is not in any of the guidebooks yet is the
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:38.560]   Park Hyatt Kyoto just opened. Park Hyatt Tokyo is the super famous Lawson Translation Hotel in
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:47.520]   Shinjuku. It has the New York bar always rammed with people. Park Hyatt Kyoto is very close to
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:54.800]   Kiyomizu-dera, which is one of the most famous places of worship. Absolutely a must, a worth the
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:04.560]   hype temple. But it's right in the heart of the action. It's accessible to everyone because they
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:11.360]   have a bar, totally different than the one in Tokyo, but this bar overlooks the city and the
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:21.680]   one very famous pagoda. I couldn't hold a conversation when I was there because I was
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:32.800]   so mesmerized by the view. It is just one of those... It costs $18, the price of a cocktail,
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:40.160]   to have this incredible view. Because it's so new, no one's talking about it yet.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:46.800]   So, it's a very small bar with a very few amount of seats. But if you're going really soon,
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:52.640]   absolutely go and do this. The hotel is extremely expensive and is only for a certain
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:23:00.400]   type of traveler, but this is something that I feel is pretty accessible to everyone and absolutely
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:07.760]   worth doing at sunset. In the wintertime, that sunset is oddly early. So, if you're okay having
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:21.600]   a drink at 4.45pm, absolutely go for it. This is my one revelation of Kyoto on this particular trip
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.760]   a few weeks ago. We stayed at the Park Hyatt in Kyoto. You say it's very expensive, but I will say
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:34.160]   Chase transfers to Hyatt. Park Hyatt on points is maybe one of the best deals in the world. So,
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:39.200]   it is actually accessible if you can find the availability. The hotel was amazing. I will say
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:46.560]   we stayed there weeks after it opened, and it was very rough around the edges. I have no doubt that
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:52.240]   the Park Hyatt has cleaned up those rough edges. But we had some frustrating experiences for a
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:58.000]   hotel of that level. But wow, the bar was amazing. We couldn't even get into the restaurant at the
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.640]   hotel, which is next to the bar and had an awesome view. So, I can't speak to it because even though
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:07.280]   we stayed there four nights, they were like, "Oh, sorry. We don't have any tables." It was
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.360]   such a strange thing to not be able to eat at the hotel restaurant on a few days notice. But
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:19.840]   wholeheartedly recommend the hotel. It's so beautiful and very inaccessible with dollars,
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:27.040]   but accessible with points. Yeah. Hyatt's great for that. A lot of people level up to the Grand
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:36.000]   Hyatt in Tokyo, which is cheaper than the Park Hyatt brand. It's one level down. That hotel,
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.960]   decor-wise, it's long in the tooth. I'm not going to mince words. Oh, I'm mincing words,
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:50.160]   I guess. But the location is great. You're really right in the middle of town, and it's a little
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.520]   splurge if you're more of a budget traveler and you have those points. Go for the Grand.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:02.000]   I'll share a couple things from Kyoto from our trip that are just quick hits that I really
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.960]   enjoyed. So, bar Rocking Chair, I went one night with my brother-in-law and we were like,
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:15.280]   "Do we even have to leave? Should we just stay here and keep coming back?" It's such a cool bar.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:22.720]   It was also very funny because my brother-in-law is like 6'5" and almost every place to go in
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:32.720]   Japan... He barely fit in part of that restaurant or bar. There's a tea shop called Yugen, which
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:39.040]   serves matcha, and it was just wonderful. It was the most beautifully... I say this about so many
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:46.000]   parts of Japan, but a very beautifully designed matcha shop that I really loved. And then I
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.160]   already mentioned the pizza shop at the beginning. And Coco Raya was just an izakaya that we went to.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:52.880]   We had a great time. I'm not going to say it's the best izakaya in the world, but
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:56.640]   if you're looking for one, we had a great time there.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:04.400]   I'm going to add a tea destination as well. Ippudo. So, not Ippudo, like the ramen, but Ippudo.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:16.080]   They're really close to the Ritz-Carlton and they do tea tasting. So, think of it exactly
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:20.880]   in a wine tasting kind of way. You can sign up to do a tea tasting. Their product is...
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:29.520]   The taste is incredible. The packaging is so beautiful. This is a good omiyage for someone
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:35.120]   that you really like back at home or someone that you're meeting in Japan. It has a very storied
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:42.800]   reputation in the country. One of the places that I want to recommend is Monk. It's a restaurant
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:51.040]   that my editor at Bloomberg, she was in Japan with her husband a few years ago, and she ate there.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:56.240]   I was in Tokyo at the time and she called me and she was like, "Get your butt down to Kyoto. You
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.480]   need to go to this restaurant and you need to write about it." Basically, what it is, is it
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:10.160]   takes the multi-course kaiseki idea in Japanese cuisine, but it flips it Italian style.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:16.240]   And instead of having a hearty rice dish, which usually punctuates the end of a kaiseki meal,
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.960]   it's a pizza. Let's not obsess about pizza in Japan. People are going to think we're weird.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:34.960]   It's run by Chef Imai and he brings this monastic discipline to his food. I believe,
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:46.800]   after our story ran, it found its way to a Netflix Chef's Table episode. It's well worth
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.680]   checking out. Also, give yourself a little bit of time to walk around that part of town. It's a
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:55.120]   little more residential. It's a little more out of the way. You're not going to see other tourists
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:02.400]   over there. It's beautiful. There's a beautiful path that goes through the nature of that
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:09.680]   neighborhood, too. Bundle that experience together. Any specific types of food that,
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.360]   if you're in Kyoto, Kyoto is the place to try X or Y?
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:21.600]   That's a good question. I did want to give one suggestion that is along those lines,
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:29.440]   but a little unexpected. It's gin. There's a gin tasting room called Kinobi. Kinobi came out the
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:36.960]   gate about five or six years ago now. As someone who writes about a lot of different destinations
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.080]   all over the world, I'm constantly being pitched to local gin. Constantly. People are making gin
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:51.040]   out of sawdust at this point. I was fascinated by Kinobi. They're using a lot of the local
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:29:01.760]   botanicals. There's Kyoyasai, basically the local Kyoto harvest, which really informs this gin.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:08.320]   I'm admittedly not a big gin person. I'm more of a brown spirits person. This is absolutely my
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:14.000]   favorite. In the quiet of the pandemic, they opened a tasting room. It is well worth going
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.560]   to try. Speaking of Kyoyasai and this local harvest, this is really what the area is all about.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:29.760]   One of the best restaurants, it's not going to break the budget. It's called Yasai Hori. Hori
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:36.960]   is the name of the chef. There's a lot of indoor shopping arcades in Kyoto. It's off of one of
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:46.720]   those, really inconspicuous. It has one, two tables, and eight bar tops. The only staff member
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:54.800]   is chef. He's going to do really honest food. I think a lot of American food is overly sauced.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:07.600]   This is the antidote. This is mushrooms on an open fire. This is avocado and red onion. This is
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:14.960]   very, very simple cuisine that the ingredients are just screaming flavor at you.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:20.720]   This is not a good thing to be talking about right before lunch. I'm like, "Do I eat here or
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:26.160]   just go to SFO and take a sip of your can?" It seems like we bring up a lot of food and
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:31.440]   drinking, but are there other things to spend the time in between eating or drinking in Kyoto,
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:34.000]   other than a few of the shrines that you think are worth highlighting?
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:42.880]   I think that you're not going to find that Brooklyn-esque quality that you do in
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:51.600]   Tokyo with certain neighborhoods that are just so effortlessly cool. But it's well worth picking
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:57.200]   a couple of neighborhoods in Kyoto, as well, and doing the back alley walks. You're just going to
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:04.320]   see a lot of businesses that have been around for 300 or 400 years, places that sell very specific
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:15.280]   things like 11 types of scissors. There was a shop that I went to that sold needles for sewing
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:24.160]   that had little sculptures on the tip, on the eye, like a little frog that you had to look at
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:30.160]   through a magnifying glass. Little specific shops like this, that you're only going to find by doing
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:36.160]   a back alley walk in neighborhoods like Gion, in Sanjo, different places like that.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:40.720]   And culturally, is it okay if you see a little shop, even if you're not going to buy a needle
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:45.280]   or a pair of scissors, to walk in and look around? Is that okay?
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:55.360]   Absolutely. You can go into any shop that's open, thank them for their time, express interest in
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:01.520]   what they're doing. A lot of people are really proud of the things that they're doing. I was in
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:09.120]   a small town on Lake Biwa on my last trip, about an hour outside of Kyoto, called Hikone,
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:15.760]   and went for udon. At the end of the meal, the man who ran the udon shop, his wife,
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:21.760]   was making origami. When the bill was paid, she handed me an origami crane. She was like, "Here,
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:26.480]   I made this." And she was just so proud of it. And I kept it. It's in my office now.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:32.880]   And I think you just find great pride in what everyone's doing. So, engage with those people.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:37.360]   It's not usually the people that are in the shop, it's their stuff.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:43.920]   I will say, this translates to anytime you're getting anything. Even if it's the concierge
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.200]   giving you their business card. I think in American culture, it's like, "Thanks,
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.720]   throw it in your pocket." I find that anytime you're getting anything, just holding it and
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:33:00.080]   accepting it and appreciating it is a sign of respect that goes a long way and is much more
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:05.520]   the standard of receiving things in Japan. If you're expecting someone to be an engaged
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:12.560]   shop owner, be an engaged customer. This is, again, that give and take. You're part of the
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:18.400]   social dynamic. Not everything is just coming to you. We said we were going to not go as deep on
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.960]   other places as we did on Tokyo and Kyoto. But I do want to highlight some of them because I think
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:28.240]   people who have that extra few days where they want to go see something more than just Tokyo
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.200]   and Kyoto or people who are coming back and want to see something else, you did a high level of
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:39.600]   the four islands and a little bit of the vibe on each. But what are some emerging destinations or
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:46.320]   interesting places that you'd suggest people go to? I really only have one. So I'll go first,
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:52.560]   which is we found this hotel. And it was what you were describing where we were looking for
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:59.600]   that traditional eat breakfast and dinner in the hotel, not really go anywhere, relax experience.
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:04.960]   And so we just took a trip to a region called Niigata. And we stayed at this amazing design
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:11.120]   hotel called Satoyama Jujo, which I would say it's not quite a real con, but in that we weren't
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:18.480]   sleeping on tatami mats and it wasn't that traditional, but it was amazing. And that town
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.400]   was known for soba. So we kind of walked around town and walked by a school. And it was definitely
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:31.680]   not a popular destination out in the season we went. But that was just an awesome hotel and
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.840]   relaxing experience for a couple of days. And that's all I have. So I'm going to turn
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:43.120]   the entirety of of non Tokyo Kyoto, Japan over to you. So I'll circle back on that idea of what are
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:49.600]   the ingredients for a perfect first or fourth trip to Japan, which is old and new mountains and sea.
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:56.960]   And I think all of them are really easy to hit. You can hit them all very close to Tokyo,
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:05.360]   even if you only have a shorter trip. I spent quite a bit of time in Kyushu in the southern
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:15.600]   most main island this time around, because I am a major fan of onsen culture, hot spring culture.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:21.600]   And because the islands are so active volcanically, there is just hot water gurgling up everywhere,
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:28.800]   to the point where there are hotels in Tokyo that pipe in hot water from miles and miles and
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:37.280]   miles away to have that mineral water bath within the property. Kyushu is sort of the
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:44.880]   motherland of onsen culture, more so than places like Hakone, which you might have heard of a lot,
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.680]   because it's very close to Tokyo. So a lot of people go there. Kyushu has an Oita prefecture,
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:57.040]   and I should say, as an aside, prefectures are like states, and they all have different
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:03.920]   reputations, and they all have different local foods and vibes, and they all kind of compete
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:13.200]   against each other. Oita prefecture on Kyushu has two major onsen towns. One's called Beppu,
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:23.600]   and one's called Yufuin. Both have a ton of places to stay. There's an international university in
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.400]   Beppu, and a lot of people that go there work in some of these hotels. So the level of English in
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:34.880]   Beppu is better than in Tokyo, which is very confusing. You can choose from a variety of
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:42.160]   types of properties. There's an intercontinental in Beppu. For example, if you want the comfort
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:46.720]   of something familiar, or you can go all the way down to a very traditional inn while you're
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:51.600]   sleeping on tatami. If you've ever looked at a photo of Beppu, it looks like it's exploding.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:57.200]   There's just steam coming up from every vent as you walk down the street. It's really cool.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:05.360]   Yufuin is in the mountains, and it's a little bit more rural. Major tourism destination as well,
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:13.520]   as far as onsen and hot springs culture goes. There is a very prescribed way that you soak in
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:21.840]   onsen. You must wash yourself before you go in, and you must be naked. If that's uncomfortable
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:30.640]   for you, IHG hotels have a variety of hot spring hybrid hotels all throughout the country.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:36.480]   I would just look at their Japan offerings. They have a property in Hakone, for example,
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:43.840]   that you can go in your bathing suit. If you're traveling with someone of the opposite gender,
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.000]   you can also go and bathe together. I'm going to give the opposite advice,
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.600]   which is if you're uncomfortable with it, try to get comfortable.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:58.320]   Oh, yeah. I am all about the real onsen experience. You're right. I shouldn't just
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:05.440]   give the caveat. Absolutely dive in headfirst, pun intended. This is absolutely something that
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:12.880]   you can try. In the way that you always see in the news every once in a while, "Oldest man in
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:20.160]   the world, what is his secret to living until 126?" So many of these people are from Kyushu,
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:27.200]   from Beppu, and they all talk about how hot spring culture is so important to them. It's so profound
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:32.560]   and widespread in Oita Prefecture that a lot of houses don't have running water because they have
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.120]   an onsen down the street. Every morning and every evening, they go and soak, and they talk with
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:43.040]   their friends. There's a major social component to this as well. Okay. That sounds like a place that
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.920]   I've never been and want to go. Actually, I left off Hakone because we did go there on an early
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:56.640]   trip. It's beautiful. Mount Fuji in the background. It was wonderful. Any other thoughts on whether
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:03.680]   it's a day trip or a side trip from Tokyo or Kyoto, or even a flight somewhere else or train?
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:13.200]   Yeah. I think you're on the right track with a trip out to Hakone. It's just this weird prescribed
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:19.680]   thing that a lot of operators have people do, and it's just become this sort of golden circle thing
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.440]   where you're like, "Okay, I'm going to Tokyo and Hakone and then Kyoto, and we're done." Outside
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:33.280]   of Hakone in the greater Fuji area, there are some incredible places to stay and some incredibly
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:41.520]   beautiful and natural environments. There's the five Fuji lakes. I would have a look into those.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:48.480]   Those are nestled right under the mountain. All have incredible views. That is something
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:59.040]   that's specifically different than the Hakone experience. I really like Shuzenji as a little
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:05.040]   town. There's a really cool place to stay there. A couple of cool places,
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:10.160]   ranging from budget to high end. This is small town Japan, and it's really close to Tokyo.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:18.240]   North of Tokyo is Nikko, a major UNESCO site. A lot of people, for some reason,
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:25.600]   do it as a day trip from Tokyo. Do not do it as a day trip. It is so far you will be tired,
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:29.920]   and you're missing the beauty of it, which is the evening after all the crowds are gone.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:36.880]   You can go see the UNESCO protected sites, but for me, Shuzenji, Lake Shuzenji is stunning,
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:40.640]   and there are a few really cool places to stay on the lake there.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.760]   Though a big question that I get is, "How do I do Kyoto without going to Kyoto?"
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:54.080]   There's already conversations about how to curb overcrowding in Kyoto. A lot of people are opting
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:41:03.520]   to go to Kanazawa instead of Kyoto. Kanazawa, back in feudal times, different feudal entities
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:10.880]   measured their wealth by rice, how much rice they were making. Rice was currency. After the strong
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:19.440]   hold in Kyoto, Kanazawa, the Maeda clan, were the second wealthiest. There's a lot of that old
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:25.200]   culture still intact. One of the most beautiful gardens in all of Japan, and the Japanese rank
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.800]   their gardens, and there are three that are considered the nicest, and one of them is in
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:35.040]   Kanazawa. This is that little Kyoto that you're going to get with far less people. It's much
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:41.120]   smaller, but if you're allergic to crowds, this is the place for you. Kaga Prefecture, the area
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:50.560]   around it, is also a teeming onsen destination. I have mixed feelings about Hokkaido. I grew up in
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:59.360]   Canada. I was born with skis on. Love a good ski trip. Hokkaido has japao, an incredible powder.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:05.840]   I have really mixed feelings about going to Japan for the skiing. I think you can get
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:13.120]   great skiing in Canada. You can get great skiing in the US. I think it's a bit of a shame to devote
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:20.480]   your Japanese holiday to something that you can do really well in other places. I'm a bit allergic
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:28.560]   to recommending a ski trip with your Japan trip. Instead, I would pick places that you're really
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.720]   getting culturally fulfilled. We love to ski. We have not done skiing in Japan for that reason.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:40.640]   I think a part of it's like, "Oh, it'd be so interesting to do that, but how could we prioritize
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:46.720]   that over all?" I've never been to all these amazing other prefectures and islands even.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:52.480]   We've stayed so central. Gosh, I feel like there is an infinite more Japan for us to see.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:58.400]   The fact that you feel the same way after 20 years makes me feel like it'll just be on the
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:03.920]   rotation constantly. It's probably the country we've been to the most, other than, of course,
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:10.720]   where we live. Any other final thoughts, tips, things that you have on your notes
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:15.120]   that maybe we should have said earlier but didn't, that are worth sharing?
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:18.080]   Um, I think we're pretty...
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.560]   I have a couple random ones.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.320]   Okay, go. Yeah.
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:31.440]   One, shopping is fantastic, but if you are in any way very tall in the U.S.,
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:38.160]   it is a very interesting experience. I think I'm like a 2XL. I couldn't find any shoes,
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:44.720]   and pants fit me like capris, and I'm only six feet tall. I would say keep that in mind when
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:51.280]   shopping because it can be a difficult experience if you fall. My brother-in-law basically couldn't
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.800]   buy anything because he was so tall. So that was one on the general side.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:03.920]   And then we didn't talk at all about Osaka. But I would say, as you mentioned before we
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:08.960]   started recording, it's known as the food city, but the entire country is a food country. So
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:13.440]   you don't necessarily need to go there and go out of your way. But if you are there,
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:21.520]   um, fantastic okonomiyaki. I believe Osaka is kind of known for it. That's a thing to hit up
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.400]   there. And there's a bar in Osaka called Bible Club, which was one of the coolest kind of like
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:31.040]   speakeasy-ish bars I've ever been to. And I'd put that on your list.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:36.320]   I would also just add that this is maybe something that you don't want to hear.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:46.240]   It is the best place to just indulge in the joy of exploration. And it can be really hard
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:54.480]   for FOMOists. But you're not going to go wrong. You can go to New York City and go wrong.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.080]   You could end up at an olive garden by accident. You know what I mean?
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:06.160]   Japan is such a good place to, you know, I always want to tell readers of my guidebooks,
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:13.040]   you know, go to Ebisu Station in Tokyo and go to Ebisu Yokocho. You can Google it. You'll find
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:20.960]   where it is. It is like a little kind of street foodie indoor area. And just pick one of the
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.440]   stalls. You're going to see they all cook one thing. What's the thing that looks delicious to
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:32.720]   you? Rather than hyper-focusing on the one place that you have to go, there are tens of thousands
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.840]   of restaurants to choose from. So many of them are incredible. It's such a great destination
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:43.200]   to come home and say, "I found this place." You get to have a little bit of ownership over your
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.880]   own experience. Certainly talk to your friends about the things that they've done. Certainly
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:52.400]   go to the places that we're recommending here. But take the opportunity to add serendipity into
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:57.520]   your schedule. It's the best country to do it. I love that recommendation. Half of the
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:04.560]   recommendations I have are just places we randomly found. Certainly, the rest of them might be things
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:11.200]   that we found in books or on tabloid or anything. The one last thing I'm going to ask you is,
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:15.600]   because someone wrote in and asked about Naoshima Island, do you have any thoughts on
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:25.360]   visiting there? The Satoshi Inland Sea has a lot of different islands. If you dip into the history
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:30.080]   of how that all came about, it's really fascinating. It's a really compelling
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:35.920]   conservation project to redevelop a destination that was deemed undesirable.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:45.680]   Rather than just having a pit stop, I would recommend going to a variety of the different
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:52.160]   islands in that area. It's a really upcoming destination, not just because of all the art
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:47:00.160]   that's there, but new and interesting hotels are being built. There's a big push to keep
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:06.400]   populations in smaller places and not have everyone move to Tokyo or Osaka. There's a
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:11.280]   lot of government money that's being spent, and that is one of the destinations that's continuing
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:17.440]   to grow. I would expand your holiday there rather than it just being a beat.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:23.840]   I haven't been there, so that's yet one more thing to put on the list for the next trip,
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:28.080]   which, if we're going to try to do it without kids, is going to be shorter than we wanted
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:35.920]   or farther away in the future. This has been amazing. As I think to the future of episodes
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.040]   like this, I'm going to start to wonder whether it makes sense to try to do a country. It was
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:47.120]   always a gamble whether we do countries or cities. I appreciate you indulging in this crazy idea.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:53.680]   Obviously, you've written blog posts, articles, stories, guidebooks all about Japan.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:59.280]   Where can people stay on top of everything you're doing and everything you're up to?
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.880]   I write for a variety of different publications. I keep an archive of those articles at
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:11.440]   BrandonPresser.com. I'm active on my Instagram, shooting real-time photos of the destinations
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:16.720]   that I'm in. My handle is @BrandPress, the first five letters of my first name and last name.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:23.360]   You can find all of my stories on Japan in every publication from Travel & Leisure, Bloomberg,
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:29.680]   Cognizant Traveler, The Daily Beast, and so forth. I'll send them your way so that you can have a look.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.960]   That's awesome! We'll put some of those in the show notes. I asked Brandon what would
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.600]   make this a huge win for him for coming on for an hour. And on the recording mark,
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.440]   we're almost at two. And he said, "You know what? I post a lot of cool stuff on Instagram. I'd love
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.320]   more people to see that." So if you're listening, go check out his Instagram. If you like to be
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:52.080]   inspired by awesome photos of travels, give him a follow. And if you want to hear some crazy stories,
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:58.960]   when we had him on last time, we talked about his book, about the wild pirate craziness of
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.840]   the history of the Pitcairn Islands. Go back and listen to our episode. We not only talked about
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.400]   traveling like a local and not just a tourist and some crazy other things about travel,
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:11.680]   but we talked about some of the crazy stories from that. It's an awesome book.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.360]   Definitely check that out too. Brandon, thank you for staying on for so long and being here today.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.360]   It was my pleasure. There's so much fun.
