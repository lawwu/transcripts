[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.080]   - A podcast listener named Laura writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.880]   Dear Pastor John, my husband and I were out shopping
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.900]   and I saw him check out this very nice looking woman
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.980]   who was rather scantily dressed.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.820]   We are seniors and I thank God for the way
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.060]   that I look at 70, even though I'm more concerned
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.160]   about how much I resemble my savior and Lord.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.300]   We walked out of the store and he practically ran
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.340]   with a cart to get a better look at this much younger woman.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.020]   It broke my heart because I have no interest
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.680]   in anyone but him.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.940]   My question is how do I deal with this?
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.020]   I know in my heart he committed adultery
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.540]   according to God's word.
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600]   Is this typical of older men?
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.900]   Will it get worse?
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.100]   Will he lose his desire for me?
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.860]   Is it just him or is it me?
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.500]   So Pastor John, what would you say to Laura
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.580]   or to any wife who feels like she is competing
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.340]   with other women for her husband's attention?
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.620]   - Well, Tony, I've got to say something to the man first.
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.620]   I know you and she are asking for me to counsel her
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.100]   and I will in just a minute, but I've got to address
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.900]   this man just in case he or other men.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.620]   I'm 68, I know what she's talking about.
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.660]   And so let me say something to him.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.660]   And here in brief is what I'm gonna say to him.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.620]   Put the desire for the flesh of another woman
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.300]   in sight or in hand.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.500]   Isn't it interesting that Jesus said,
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.980]   "If your eye calls you to sin
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.300]   "or if your hand calls you to sin,
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.860]   "gouge it out, cut it off."
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.300]   Whether it's sight or hand,
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.540]   like a man in a nursing home that reaches out
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.580]   and pets a behind of a nurse.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.900]   I mean, I'm talking, yes, this sort of thing happens.
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.700]   Put that to death, man, by the spirit
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.580]   as soon as it raises its head.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.220]   Tear your eye out, renounce the lure and turn away.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.220]   Don't dignify the bait of the flesh by biting on it.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.860]   It's all shiny like a fishing lure,
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.460]   but it's got hooks in it and they will make you look stupid
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940]   when they pull your jaw apart.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.100]   So let me, another word to the husband.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.900]   You are old enough, fella, to know that there are deeper,
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.700]   wider, longer, greater pleasures in life
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.340]   than the titillation of skin.
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.340]   Come on, this is adolescent of you.
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.020]   It is mere animal.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.740]   A 70-year-old man acting like a dog in heat
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.380]   is not only silly, it's tragic.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.060]   It's a tragic witness to 70 wasted years
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.180]   for getting a wise heart.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.260]   One last word to Mr. Man.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.420]   One aspect of that wisdom, old sage,
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.620]   is the value of your wife.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.420]   The 70-something sage says, okay, this is the sage,
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.500]   the real man who's learned 70 years worth of wisdom.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.340]   He says, "This is my woman.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.340]   "Saggy, blotchy skin, gray hair, wrinkled face,
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.060]   "decreased or absent libido.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.060]   "This is my woman, my treasure, my jewel,
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.580]   "my gift from heaven, my covenant one,
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.180]   "my intimate flesh, my own body, myself.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.060]   "To be faithful to her with my eyes and my hands
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.020]   "is a satisfaction deeper and higher and sweeter
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.280]   "than any glimpse or any touch
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.580]   "of any other woman in the world."
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.940]   That's what the 70-something sage says.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.940]   Okay, now, Laura, you asked about your own heart,
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.420]   and here's my word to you.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.420]   Number one, in a moment of solitude with your husband,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.560]   I mean, nobody else around, when things are good,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.820]   it is permissible and fitting to say with affection
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.460]   something like this.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.300]   Can I share my heart with you about something?
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.980]   I could be wrong in how seriously to take it, honey,
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.220]   but it seemed to me that you tried pretty hard
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.440]   to look at a young woman this morning
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.980]   who was kind of scantily clad.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.500]   I know that such a sight will always catch a man's eye.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.780]   She knows it, too.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.980]   That's her whole point.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.700]   I don't blame you for that glance.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.020]   You're a man.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.460]   But I think it was Billy Graham who said,
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.020]   "It's the second look that's the trouble."
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.380]   And whether he's right about that or not,
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.460]   it made me feel bad.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.340]   It made me feel less loved, less valued.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.240]   I know you didn't mean that, probably.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.360]   I love you.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.880]   I don't want to feel like I'm losing your heart
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.440]   or even your eyes.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.560]   And then you pray that God will take that conversation
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.980]   in a healing direction.
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.740]   So I just wanna give you permission to go ahead.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.700]   That's not insubordination or inappropriate at all
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.620]   to go to him that way.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.220]   Here's the second thing I'd say.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.780]   No, it is not inevitable that older men
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.560]   need to pursue younger women with their eyes
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.300]   because their wives are aging.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.400]   No.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.780]   A man can mature and love his wife
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.060]   for all that she has been and is and will be,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.860]   including delicious memories of young bodies
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.060]   and deep pleasures of present and seasoned faithfulness.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.460]   If a man insists on being a playboy at age 70,
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.840]   he should realize that he indeed is playing the part
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.200]   of a boy and not a man, and he should be ashamed.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.500]   And the third thing I would say, Laura,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.320]   is don't dwell on this to the point of imagining things
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.040]   that may not be true of him.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.140]   You may be wrong.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.340]   The longer you brood over it,
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.920]   the more the devil will use it
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.580]   to sow seeds of distrust and anger.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.100]   Speak to him, yes, and then pray for him
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.380]   and hand him over to God.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   God holds you accountable for your responses, not his sins.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.700]   And fourth, find your deepest joy
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.620]   in God's presence and promises.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.680]   He delights in the inner beauty of your faith
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.580]   and fearlessness and humility and quiet peacefulness.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.900]   And God gives himself to you for your fellowship
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.100]   and your enjoyment.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.760]   Fear not for I am with you.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.840]   I will never leave you.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.220]   I'll never forsake you.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.460]   In my presence is fullness of joy.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.780]   At my right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.220]   And the last thing I would say is give your husband
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.420]   as much joy as you can every day,
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.500]   and know, as Paul writes in another context,
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.540]   but I think it applies, that in doing so,
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.300]   in serving your husband,
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.660]   you are serving your heavenly husband
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.620]   who is infinitely worthy,
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.380]   even when your earthly husband
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.100]   at any given moment may not be.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.700]   - Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Laura,
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.500]   for reaching out and sending the email question into us.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.300]   This podcast really benefits from well-articulated
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.460]   and honest questions like this one from Laura,
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.140]   so please keep emailing them into us
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.980]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.140]   Due to the volume of emails,
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.420]   we simply cannot respond to each of them,
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.260]   but we do read them and we get them, so thank you.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.980]   And I should note that if you request
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.520]   that your name remain anonymous,

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.780]   Well, we all know we should pray for things,
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.020]   but when should we stop praying for something?
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.580]   That's the question on the table tomorrow
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.180]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.020]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
