[00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.980]   - Cool, so my name is Boris.
[00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.200]   I'm a member of technical staff at Anthropic
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.600]   and creator of QuadCode.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.520]   Because the more general model always wins
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.640]   and the model increases in capability exponentially
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.600]   and there are many corollaries to this.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.860]   We announced a couple weeks ago
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.300]   that you can now use Quad on GitHub.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.180]   And then this is something that I do
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.160]   pretty much every day on Monday.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.280]   We have a standup every week.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.940]   I'll just ask Quad what did I ship that week.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.000]   It'll look through my git commits
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.640]   and it'll help me so I don't have to keep track.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.620]   The second one is TDD.
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.760]   I know I try to use TDD.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.140]   It's like, it's pretty hard to use in practice.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.320]   But I think now with coding tools
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.960]   it actually works really well.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.080]   And maybe the reason is it's not me doing it,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.420]   it's the model doing it.
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.640]   Thanks.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.120]   Thank you.
