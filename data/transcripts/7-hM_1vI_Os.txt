[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   Alright, Pastor John, last time in episode 240, you promised to offer us your six reasons
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.320]   why you would counsel a Christian against getting a tattoo.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320]   So what are those reasons?
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.280]   Well, let's make sure, Tony, that I'm not saying that getting a tattoo is intrinsically
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.200]   a sin or an evil.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.700]   I'm not going to go there because I don't see the warrant for it in Scripture.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.280]   I don't think it is.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.120]   I don't think that's a way we should go about making decisions like this.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.880]   I tried to give biblical guidelines yesterday for how to think about tattoos as well as
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.040]   jewelry and makeup and hairdos and clothing.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.960]   They all belong to the same category, and the Bible is clear.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.680]   Following Jesus makes a difference on how you dress and how you do everything, whether
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.240]   eating or drinking, do all to the glory of God.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.200]   So with all that in mind, everything yesterday in mind, and I hope people will go there,
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.920]   not just here, so if you're tuning into this one and you haven't listened to that one,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.520]   please let it all stand together.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.480]   I'll give you my reasons, six of them, for why I would counsel against getting a tattoo.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.080]   Number one, some of these are just my own personal sense of wisdom.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   There's maybe a little more closely related to Scripture, but let every man judge and
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.960]   hold fast to what is good.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.120]   In view of Paul's counsel against adornment being minimally external and maximally internal,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.680]   and in view of his counsel that the adornment or the hair not signify excessive preoccupation
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:56.120]   with looks, I would say tattoos do signify a fairly high preoccupation with looks, because
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.800]   to choose to get an adornment that will be with you forever is a high-level commitment
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.400]   to adornment.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.200]   I think probably too high.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.400]   That's number one.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   Tattoos are permanent.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.080]   Unless you pay big bucks with significant pain to have them removed.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   Most people who get tattoos, I think, aren't thinking about that pain, thinking about that
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   money.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   They're thinking, "Okay, this is forever."
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.680]   Thus, they're like putting on lipstick you can never take off.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.120]   They're like applying eye shadow that you will wear day and night forever.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.560]   They're like a necklace that grows into your skin and stays there permanently.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.520]   They're like a twist you put in your hair and can never, ever remove, no matter how
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.480]   the styles change.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.480]   I think it's foolish to do with a tattoo what you would not do with any of your other skin
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   adornments.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.600]   That's number two.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.080]   Number three, you will change.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.040]   You will not look the same in 20 years or have the same tastes.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.760]   The lightning bolt on your neck is going to look like a ridiculous splotch on the folds
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.200]   of your wrinkled skin.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   Tattooing is a naive way of thinking that you will like now, that what you like now,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.800]   you're going to like in 20 or 30 years.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   You won't.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.040]   In 15 years, you will have different tastes.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.640]   The culture will be different.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.840]   What is cool now will look silly and trendy and dated.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.380]   Someday you will grow.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.280]   That moment of youthful identity seeking will be branded forever like an indelible reminder
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.300]   of immaturity in your skin.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.580]   Not wise.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.520]   Number four, tattoos do not make you prettier or more handsome.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.400]   Now here, I know this is opinion and just hear my opinion, take it or leave it.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.360]   Tattoos are in general ugly.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.380]   They're discolorations of pretty skin and they get uglier as time goes by.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.620]   Even the colors that the efforts make, they're not pretty colors.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.300]   You're very limited in what you can do with that tattoo.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.460]   It's kind of a grayish blue.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.980]   Men find women's skin attractive to see and to touch.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.300]   Tattoos do not make that skin more desirable or attractive.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.220]   That's one man's view and you can take it or you can leave it.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.780]   At the gym that I go to, I pity the women with tattoos.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.380]   From 20 feet away, they look like they're burned and disfigured.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.540]   It's very, very sad.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.980]   So think long, think hard, women.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.980]   You have beautiful skin.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.980]   Men like it.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.380]   Don't mess it up.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.580]   Number five, the best motive I can think of for a tattoo is a kind of self-imposed Christian
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.300]   branding.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.060]   Some Christian symbol or words that say I belong to Jesus.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.100]   Now my problem with that motive is that there is a much better way to brand yourself biblically,
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.620]   namely with love.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.460]   Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.660]   Tattoo branding is too easy and it may not be the note you want to strike in 10 years.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.540]   You may think I've picked out the perfect timeless symbol or I've picked out the perfect
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.460]   verse to put on my arm or whatever.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.860]   No, you don't know that.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:32.140]   You will change and the note you want to strike may be a different note in 25 years.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.720]   Number six, tattoos are missionally limiting.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.960]   You may get a tattoo now because you're trying to reach tattooed people with the gospel,
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.780]   but that same tattoo may be a huge stumbling block among Muslim peoples God's going to
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.420]   take you to in 15 years.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.580]   You don't know what the future holds.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.820]   So in sum, here's the conclusion.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.700]   Marking the skin is not intrinsically evil.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.580]   I'll never cut off anyone from fellowship in Christ because they have a tattoo or 100
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.580]   tattoos.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.980]   I'll never cut them off in Christ.
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.700]   But I doubt that the decisions that many Christians are making today to get tattoos are thought
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.000]   through as carefully and biblically as is wise.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.380]   And I've recorded this, just I hope it's part of what they take into consideration.
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.020]   I hope it helps them think wisely.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.820]   From tattoos to Christmas.
