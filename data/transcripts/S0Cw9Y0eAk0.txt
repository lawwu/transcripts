[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   I have one big question that I think everybody would like the answer to, which is, to what
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.240]   extent do you think there's life outside Earth, or not on Earth?
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.080]   And when people hear this, they think aliens, but, you know, like an insect-like creature,
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.320]   single or small multi-cell organism on another planet, that itself would be a spectacular
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.320]   find.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.680]   And I'm kind of an outlier, so just everyone should, you know, look to the actual experts
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.680]   in this field.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520]   But I have some rigorous, you know, kind of logical arguments that I believe the probability
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.560]   of life, I would never say it's zero, but I think it's very low.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.680]   And I think I can substantiate that.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.000]   And the best part is I can't be falsified right now.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.320]   There's zero evidence that there's life anywhere else in the universe, period, full stop, end
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.320]   of sentence.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.520]   There's no evidence, conclusive evidence.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360]   Lots of drones over in New Jersey right now, not no evidence of life anywhere else.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.160]   I knew we'd get into drones.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.320]   So the argument that it would somehow, first of all, transform our understanding of human
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.180]   place is inarguable to me.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.080]   I believe that's true, although in this movie Contact, it's a really wonderful movie.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.080]   It's not cheesy science fiction.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.960]   It was the first to, like, use a wormhole and all sorts of cool stuff as contrivances.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.880]   But in that movie, there's a scene where President Bill Clinton is talking about the discovery
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.160]   that this fictitious character made.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.480]   But he's actually talking about a meteorite that was discovered in Antarctica.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.880]   And they just clipped that.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.000]   And the meteorite was believed to have microbial life, and that meteorite's origin was inarguably
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   from Mars.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   OK?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.040]   So the reasoning was, this is 1997, that there was a meteorite found in Antarctica where
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   it's easy to find meteorites.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.360]   Is it in the movie or in real life?
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.360]   It's in real life.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.880]   In 1997, a scientist announced the discovery of a meteorite from Antarctica.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.320]   It's called Allen Land-Hills meteorite.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.880]   And it had what they claimed were evidence of microbial life and even respiration byproducts
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.040]   of these microbial life forms, OK?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.000]   It was such a big deal that within minutes, you know, Bill Clinton had a press conference
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.920]   on the White House lawn where he goes, "This rock speaks to us from across the generations
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.000]   and, if confirmed, will undoubtedly, you know, revolutionize our understanding of the universe
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   around us."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   OK?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.840]   Now, the movie clips that clip to make it seem like Ellie, the fictitious character,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.560]   were like, you know, SETI, extraterrestrial technology, not a microbe.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.600]   But in the public's mind, that actual scientific discovery was never falsified.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.920]   It was certainly never confirmed.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.440]   No one's ever come back to say that was correct and that we did find microbial evidence, microbial
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   life on Mars.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   Now, how did that meteorite get there?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.200]   Well, some asteroids hit the moon.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.560]   That's why it has craters on it.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.960]   It hits the Earth.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.760]   That's why we have Meteor Crater, Arizona, Winslow, Arizona, Yucatan, Chicxulub, where
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.040]   the dinosaurs' doom was sealed by the giant impactor 66 million years ago.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.400]   Those impacts occur on every planet, every moon in our solar system.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.720]   So some asteroid hit the surface of Mars probably millions of years ago, ejected material, low
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.200]   gravity on Mars, low atmosphere.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.280]   And that material has been orbiting around and eventually made its way and hit the Earth.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   OK?
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.400]   So matter from Mars landed on the Earth.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.680]   Does that make sense?
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.480]   That's how I gave you-- I have a lunar meteorite that I'm giving to you, again, as a token
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.400]   of my appreciation for all you do.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.520]   That came the same way.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.080]   Something hit the moon, blasted off some lunar-- it's called breccia, it's the crust of the
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.280]   moon-- eventually made its way, landed in Northwest Africa.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.720]   And I bought a slice of it from a-- I got a dealer, you know, I got a meteorite dealer.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.800]   And I got that for you, OK?
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.440]   So what's the lesson?
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.920]   Material gets exchanged from planet to planet.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   Now I ask the following question.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.160]   If that happened on Mars to the Earth, the moon to the Earth, so too has material from
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.400]   the Earth been ejected since life emerged 3.7 billion years ago.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.680]   There's literally millions of tons of Earth that's floating around in space.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.180]   Some of that will have landed on Mars.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.800]   So someday we'll get there, we'll find some piece of it.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.180]   Now could some of it have a tardigrade on it?
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.760]   Could some of it have a protozoan on it?
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   Obviously it could.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   And yet--
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.160]   Maybe some interesting microbes.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.400]   Yeah, it could.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.480]   Maybe some ancient microbes that are no longer--
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   That's right.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   --extant.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.060]   So one theory of the formation of life on Earth, you asked me about that earlier, the
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.760]   origin of life on Earth is a huge mystery.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.040]   How did life get here?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.880]   One proposition was made by Fred Hoyle and other people.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.360]   It sounds dirty, but it's not.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   It's called panspermia.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.920]   It just means that genetic material has been transferred from another astronomical object
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.100]   landed here on Earth.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.800]   So the converse reaction occurs as well.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.480]   But the fact is we don't observe it even on Mars.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.200]   So if I told you, you know, we've discovered a planet and there's another planet right
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.640]   next to it and it has almost the same conditions.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.760]   It's in the so-called Goldilocks zone where the temperature is just right to have liquid
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.400]   water which Mars can have on it at certain times of the year in certain places on Mars.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.600]   It had flowing water on it.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.780]   We know for sure Mars had flowing water on it.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.680]   We know for sure that material from the Earth got there when Earth had life on it.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.520]   So the absence of life on Mars is a data point.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.560]   It's not probative or provative, it's positive rather, that life couldn't exist on Mars.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.320]   We haven't searched all of Mars.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.760]   But it at least shows that there's an impediment to it.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.120]   So people are fond of saying, as I told you earlier, there's about 10 to the 24th planets
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.440]   probably in our observable universe.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.680]   Going back to the Big Bang, going out to the farthest reaches of the universe.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.040]   But even if you just take the Milky Way galaxy, there's probably, you know, literally hundreds
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.240]   of billions of planets in our galaxy alone.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.000]   And when you look at that, people like to say, as Carl Sagan did, if there's no life,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.940]   it's an awful waste of space, right?
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.880]   Why is there so much space and there's no life?
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.160]   It seems incomprehensible.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.920]   But nature, you know, I love when atheist scientists will say, like, you propose God
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.360]   exists and that's the God of the gaps to explain things that you don't understand.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.960]   But when science advances, we'll have an explanation for why, you know, thunder occurs.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.880]   It's not because of Thor, right?
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.160]   We get rid of gods as we learn more and so the gap shrinks smaller and smaller.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.320]   But they'll say the same argument about life in the universe.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.880]   They'll say, well, there's got to be life because there's so much room there.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.080]   But as I told you, I've been to Antarctica twice.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.720]   The only life forms I saw there, okay, were people.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.240]   I saw a few penguins in the distance and a couple of dead sea lions.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.240]   There's no trees.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.600]   There's no flora at all in the entire continent.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.280]   It's incredibly barren.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.360]   And yet, Andrew, it makes up 8% of the land mass of the earth.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.720]   And you would think, well, it's just proportional to the amount of area, i.e. the number of
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   stars.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.000]   There should be 8% of the life on earth.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.480]   There should be a billion people there or whatever, you know, 600 million people.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.360]   No, there's nothing there except for scientists that go there.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.480]   So the odds of life, you know, you can't construct probability from possibility.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.960]   And many, many other arguments that I could give you, the improbability of life, how hard
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.960]   it is to create life.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.320]   And, you know, if you just sprinkled, imagine you had a koala cannon, okay, people at PETA
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   are going to get mad.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.800]   They're just going to go to Mars and spray it with koala.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   It's obviously not going to like start life, right?
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.120]   Well, I think PETA would probably be okay with you populating with an area with koalas.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.440]   A cannon to take out koalas, they would probably protest.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   That's right.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   They would not like that.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.440]   So, yeah.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.080]   So, you know, possibility is not probability.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.560]   The number of hurdles to create a single cell is enormous.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.040]   We have yet to reproduce, you know, to make a functional cell in the laboratory.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.800]   Not that that's a requirement to prove that life could exist elsewhere.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.680]   I'm just saying it's very hard.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.840]   Our history of life, we have an N of one.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.200]   It's very difficult to speculate on.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.240]   And if we're alone, if life is abundant, as Fermi asked many, many, many years ago, if
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.320]   life is abundant and the galaxy is old, where are they?
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   Where are the aliens?
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.040]   There should have been plenty of time, not only for them to evolve and be superior to
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.080]   us in many ways and travel the distances of our galaxy, not even of the cosmos, our galaxy.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.080]   Where are they?
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.080]   Where are they?
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.400]   I mean, we've been doing this for 80 years because we've been broadcasting radio waves
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.080]   for the last 85 years.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.640]   Do you know this theory about the gut microbiota?
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:12.560]   You know, our guts, our skin, our eyes, our nose, but certainly our entire digestive tract,
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.680]   the whole way down from our lips, out the other end, are populated with these little
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.600]   microbiota that influence everything from fatty acid production, neurotransmitter production,
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   et cetera.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   It's more than human cells.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   And it's powerful for modulating all sorts of biological processes.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   And every time we interact, shake hands, if people kiss, if you interact with dirt, if
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   you interact with a pet, the microbiome changes.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.120]   It's an inner reflection of all your outer behaviors.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.120]   Internet, yeah.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   And then we're learning a lot about it.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.160]   There's this one theory that I like that kind of turns life as you and I know it on its
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.780]   head, which is that humans and other species are just vehicles for the microbiome.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:03.340]   And so you would take something like, oh, the desire to populate Mars or to land on
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.820]   the moon as just the microbiota, taking advantage of this weird old world primate species that
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.800]   we call homo sapiens that loves to develop technology, almost destroy itself, but then
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:20.440]   continues to evolve social media, et cetera, warn each other about declining birth rates.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.580]   And then just to basically the microbiota have a, what, you know, a sort of quote-unquote
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.980]   consciousness, not a brain, but a consciousness of their own, which is like all species to
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.400]   make more of itself and to go further and further out and populate.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:39.820]   It's hard to punch holes in the logic of this model, but it certainly diminishes our conscious
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.000]   experience.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.740]   We could go on forever about this trail.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.440]   I'll just kind of put a kind of a cliffhanger out there.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.580]   It'd be wonderful sometime to sit down with you and discuss the possibility of rather
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:57.780]   than thinking about life elsewhere in the galaxy, given what we know about physics and
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.180]   engineering, astronomy, et cetera, would it be possible to build a planet at the appropriate
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.260]   distance from the sun that we could spawn life by bringing things there as opposed to
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.340]   trying to take it, you know, figure out how to do it at a distance that it might not be
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.340]   amenable to life.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.340]   - Right.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.060]   - You know, maybe creating a garden planet.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.240]   Maybe we don't put humans there right away, but trying to create a garden that could thrive
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.820]   at some appropriate distance from the sun and seeing what nutrients could be grown there.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:32.000]   You know, you could have robots man this planet, but you'd have to somehow aggregate stuff
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.180]   in space to build this planet or launch this planet up that it would collect things.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.980]   I mean, that to me feels like a fun experiment.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.980]   - It is, yeah.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.780]   - And a lot less risky than going up to other planets.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.100]   - Yeah, I was blessed as my first guest on the "Into the Impossible" podcast to have
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.100]   Freeman Dyson.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.180]   You mentioned your dad, your dad mentioned him, one of the greatest intellects of the
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.460]   last hundred years, great physicist.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.940]   And he had these ideas for these Dyson spheres, which would be, you know, energy harvesting.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:03.180]   So the first, you know, ingredient that you need to construct the Huberman planet habitable
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.300]   zone is to have energy, is harvest as much energy as possible from a star.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:14.480]   So he basically conjectured a megastructure, an alien megastructure that could be observable
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.100]   by astronomers could detect these objects and some claim that we have, but those have
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.260]   always been refuted.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.380]   And it would be basically surrounding a star, capturing every photon worth of energy that
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.300]   came out of it, and then converting that to mechanical energy.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.780]   And then, yes, and then once you have infinite energy, you can actually do fusion.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.700]   You can make up whatever molecules you want.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.380]   You could make up, you know, print 3D printing at the quark level on up, basically.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:43.340]   And so that was his, you know, conjecture how super advanced aliens would behave.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.900]   But again, we have no evidence for it, but it's fun.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.900]   It's certainly fun to have the science fiction, you know, kind of, you know, a lot of interesting
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.580]   science, you know, originates from ideas and creativity that originates from science fiction.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.580]   So yeah, it'd be a lot of fun.
