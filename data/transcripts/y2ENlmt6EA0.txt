[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.320]   - Today's question on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.460]   is really a question for you.
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.920]   Yes, you.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.960]   Are you wasting your life?
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.040]   Right now as I speak and as you listen,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.820]   are you wasting away your life?
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.560]   Questions don't get more serious or sober than that
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560]   and the stakes could not be higher.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.080]   To put this more specifically,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.080]   are you living to make much of God
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.600]   or are you living to make much of yourself?
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.560]   The answer to this question divides the course of humanity
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.240]   like the continental divide splits the course of the rivers.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.560]   It's a question Pastor John asks frequently
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.800]   and it's one he raised in his conference message,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.800]   The Essence of the Unwasted Life in March of 2008.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.360]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.400]   - There's this plant in some jungle somewhere
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.200]   and it flowers and there's a little pool
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.720]   of poisonous water down there
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.600]   and little bugs come up over the edge
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.640]   and at the top here it's slippery
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.960]   and they lose their footing and fall in and die
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.960]   and they feed the plant.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.040]   Now that's interesting
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.160]   but that's not the interesting thing ultimately.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.080]   The interesting thing ultimately is that there's a spider
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   who only lives by dropping
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.920]   by his little silver cord down into this
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.000]   and plucking those little dead animals and eating them.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.320]   Let us all bow down.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.400]   And worship mindless matter.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.120]   And natural selection.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.320]   [audience laughing]
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.280]   I mean you just need to know where I'm coming from.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.600]   When we get to the judgment seat
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.320]   and Mr. Dawkins and Hitchens and they all, they say,
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.880]   and God says, "Now what was that?
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.480]   "You said about the way that spider came into being
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.880]   "and the way humans came into being."
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.880]   And he said, "Well, we thought it was just nothing.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.600]   "I mean just forces that just kind of,
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.640]   "it just, you know, happened."
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.000]   [audience laughing]
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.040]   And I think God's gonna look at me,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.560]   he's gonna say, "Gah!"
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.600]   [audience laughing]
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.480]   He's just gonna laugh and the universe is gonna shake.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.320]   I mean I really, I cannot, I cannot take it seriously.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.520]   The universe exists to display the glory of God
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.360]   and therefore those who try to give an account
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.160]   for the universe that exists in a non-God way
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.600]   are not only laughable but they are blasphemous.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.720]   This is God's story.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.400]   The heavens are telling the glory of God.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.880]   "Open your ears," he's saying.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.560]   "It is all over the place
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.400]   "and we will give an account of whether we heard that word
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.040]   "or saw that glory."
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.080]   This is not fun and games here.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.680]   This is God speaking to us.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.720]   Now here I am, I'm down at a little hotel
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.320]   about 15 minutes that way, I'm a little,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.800]   I don't know what they call it, cottage inn
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.200]   or something like that.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.080]   And there's a swimming pool by the ocean.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.040]   I thought that is ridiculous.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.760]   [audience laughing]
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.840]   Look at that.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.680]   It's about, you know, it's about the size of this stage,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.000]   not quite, and I looked at the pool
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.640]   and then I looked up.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.360]   [audience laughing]
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   I thought, this is a man pool and that's a God pool.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.400]   [audience laughing]
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.720]   It's everywhere.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.520]   There are voices everywhere.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.280]   Just open your eyes and open your ears
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.720]   and pray for the Holy Spirit to give you a sensitivity
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.840]   of what the wasted life would be,
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.240]   namely a life that doesn't see it,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.840]   a life that doesn't hear it,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.600]   and a life that isn't shaped by the meaning of the universe
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.520]   to display the glory of God.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.040]   We are being called to join Him
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.080]   in His own self-glorification.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.080]   Now that last statement is controversial
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.280]   and I need to support it for just a few minutes.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.320]   This idea that Paul has that the unwasted life
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.060]   is a life in which he will, by life and death,
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.240]   make Christ look great because the universe exists
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.840]   to display God through His Son,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.760]   that is not Paul's idea.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.600]   That's God's idea for Paul,
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.840]   which means it's God's idea for the universe,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.360]   which means God is very self-exalting.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.360]   If God comes to you and you say to Him,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   why do I exist?
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.080]   And He says, to make much of me.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.040]   You're hearing absolute truth
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.320]   and people really stumble over this truth.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   You exist to magnify me.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.120]   Go about it and I will hold you accountable
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.840]   for whether you've done it or not.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.160]   Text after text after text.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.200]   Isaiah 43, six, bring my sons from afar
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.960]   and my daughters from the ends of the earth,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.680]   everyone who is called by my name,
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.880]   whom I created for my glory.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.260]   God created you for His glory,
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.440]   that is to make Him look glorious.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.640]   He elected Israel for His glory.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.760]   Jeremiah 13, 11, I made the whole house of Israel
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.080]   and the whole house of Judah.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.960]   Cling to me that they might be for me a people,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.360]   a name, a praise, and a glory.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.240]   He saved them from Egypt for this same reason.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.200]   Psalm 106, our fathers rebelled against the most high
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   at the Red Sea, but He saved them for His namesake
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.680]   that He might make known His power.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.360]   He rescued them from bondage in Babylon
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.520]   with these words, for my namesake, I defer my anger.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.000]   For the sake of my praise, I restrain it for you.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.160]   For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.800]   How should my name be profane?
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   My glory I will not give to another.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.000]   And He sends Jesus Christ into the world
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.240]   for the same reason, Romans 15, 7.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.080]   Christ became a servant to the circumcision
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.760]   to show God's truthfulness,
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.320]   and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.520]   for His mercy.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.920]   Christ came to earth that the Gentiles might glorify God
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.360]   for His mercy.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.620]   Father, the hour has come.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.720]   Glorify Thy Son that the Son may glorify Thee.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.480]   And He's coming back at the end for the same reason,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.040]   2 Thessalonians 1.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   He comes on that day to be glorified in His saints
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.480]   and to be marveled at by all who have believed.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.240]   He's coming to be glorified.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.280]   He's coming to be marveled at.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.500]   This truth that God is constantly, unwaveringly,
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.520]   in all that He does, exalting His Son,
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.400]   magnifying His glory,
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.880]   is vastly more loving than if He devoted Himself
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.600]   to help you like what you see in the mirror.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.400]   If God were to make Himself a means
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.720]   to your self-exaltation,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.040]   He would be a global distraction
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.360]   from what would make you happy.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.520]   You know what love is?
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.280]   It's not what the world says it is.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.080]   The world says, "Somebody loves me
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.480]   if they make much of me."
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.720]   And that feels so good, it's hard not to believe.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.480]   Somebody loves me if they make much of me.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.360]   But in that relationship, you are the end.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.200]   And He's the means.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   He makes much of me.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.720]   That's not what love is in the Bible.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.480]   In the Bible, love labors, sacrifices,
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   and even dies to liberate you from your bondage
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:40.440]   to the mirror so that you can delight in God forever.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:47.520]   You're selling your soul for a bowl of oatmeal
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.400]   when you want God to just meet your earthly needs
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.200]   and call that love.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.340]   That's not love.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.740]   Love is when God does that or not
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.460]   in ways that bring you free
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.260]   from your love affair with yourself
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.340]   and free you to enjoy making much of Him forever.
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.540]   You were made to know and love God.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.100]   You know this is true.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.700]   You stand by the seacoast.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.940]   You stand by the edge of the Grand Canyon.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.060]   You stand with your eye to a telescope,
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.340]   the Hubble telescope pictures or whatever.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.580]   You stand there and you find your soul
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.980]   drawn out of yourself and for a brief moment,
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.540]   you are free from self-consciousness and self-absorption
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.580]   and it is the most full, satisfying, deep, wonderful moment
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.500]   and it will be forever if God is the universe
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.260]   and God is the Grand Canyon and God is the ocean.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.420]   That's why you were made.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.340]   God would be unloving if He did not magnify Himself
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.740]   in your presence over and over and over.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.740]   If He did not command you to praise me,
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.660]   praise me, praise me, He would not love you.
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.300]   If He said, I praise you, I praise you, I praise you,
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.580]   He would satisfy that little teeny ego of yours
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.260]   and you would perish and your soul would shrink up
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.700]   like a peach at the back of the refrigerator.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.620]   You know that's not what you're made for.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.900]   You're made to know something vastly greater.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.220]   - Amen, that clip came from a conference message
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.740]   titled The Essence of the Unwasted Life
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.580]   which was preached on March 28th, 2008.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.100]   You can find the full message at desiringgod.org.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.780]   You can download the book as well,
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.500]   Don't Waste Your Life from the website.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.780]   Click on the book tabs and look for the title,
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.100]   Don't Waste Your Life.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.660]   So this is a strong point.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.940]   Love is God freeing us from our love affair with ourselves,
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.020]   freeing us to enjoy making much of Him forever
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.380]   and God would be unloving
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.700]   if He did not manifest His glory to us
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.380]   and take our breath away like the sight of the Grand Canyon
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.340]   over and over and over again.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.140]   But this point raises a question
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.260]   that has popped up over the years.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.020]   Yes, but doesn't God in seeking to glorify Himself
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.100]   also make much of us?
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.260]   It's a good follow-up question
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.820]   Pastor John has sought to address over the recent years
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.940]   and tomorrow we'll hear from him when I ask,
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.700]   does God delight in me?
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.060]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:25.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
