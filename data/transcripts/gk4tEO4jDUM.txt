[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan, his second time on this podcast.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.320]   He has inspired me for many years with his conversations to be a better and kinder person and has now been doing so as a
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320]   friend.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.080]   There's no one I would rather talk to on this
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.480]   300th episode of this podcast on the 4th of July,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.920]   both the anniversary of this country's Declaration of Independence and
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.260]   the anniversary of my immigrating here to the United States.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.560]   A silly kid who couldn't speak English and could never imagine that he would be
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.920]   so damn lucky as to live the life I've lived,
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.680]   to feel the love I've felt
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.280]   from the amazing people along the way.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.400]   From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I love you all.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.440]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.200]   And now, dear friends, here's Joe
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.360]   Rogan.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.560]   Charles Bukowski said something in a poem called "Style" about art.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.800]   He defined art saying, "Style is the answer to everything, a fresh way to approach a dull or dangerous thing.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.520]   To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.440]   To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art."
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.840]   What do you think he meant by that? Do you agree with us?
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.720]   Dangerous thing with style is art.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.800]   He said bullfighting can be art, boxing can be art, loving can be art.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.240]   Have you ever made love and it was art? No, OK, I'm not asking.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.360]   Every time, bro.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480]   Opening a can of sardines can be art.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.160]   I think there's something to that.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.400]   Yeah, I think I call the way people live life art.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.760]   Like I wrote a foreword to my friend Cameron Haynes's book,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.560]   which is right now the number one selling audio book in the world.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.400]   And one of the things that I said was that he practices an art that very few people appreciate.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.800]   And it's the art of the maximized life.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.840]   And that the discipline that he displays in his life
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.920]   and through his practices and all the things that he does,
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   it's so difficult to live the way he lives.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.560]   That for someone like me who understands it and knows what he's doing and appreciates it
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.800]   and appreciates how insanely difficult it is to have a full time job
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.920]   and run ultra marathons, get up at four o'clock in the morning, run a full marathon before work.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.520]   Like that's the kind of shit that he he does when he when he's training for these
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.880]   240 mile runs, all the at the same time being like a father,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.440]   a husband having this full time job,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.760]   also being the best bow hunter on earth, lifting weights.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.440]   It's like, how does a person do this?
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.480]   So in a way, discipline is art too.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.080]   Yes, discipline is art.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.880]   Yeah, I think it is because it's beautiful for me to see.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.640]   When I see someone who's really, truly disciplined,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.520]   who like a David Goggin, someone who just like truly maximizes the grind.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.200]   I feel like there's an art to that.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.440]   And there's an art to kindness.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.160]   Like there's people that are really kind and really sweet.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.560]   And when I'm around them, it's beautiful.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.880]   It's like there's an art to them.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.680]   No matter what.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.480]   They still they got, you know, the world can throw a bunch of shit at you.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.200]   But through all that.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.520]   Some people are just great at it.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.880]   And it's a it's a thing that you learn how to do.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   And it's pleasing for other people to see.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.120]   And that, I think, is where the art is.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.240]   Well, I think Bukowski also said,
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.360]   and I'm just a Bukowski quote generator today.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.240]   I love him.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.480]   I love him very much, too.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.400]   He's a dark and troubled and fascinating and a weird person.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.520]   Like Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.280]   He said, "What matters most is how you walk through the fire."
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.160]   I think.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.800]   So there's a bit of the Ken Haynes in that, too.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.320]   David Goggins in that, too.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.240]   What do you think he meant by that?
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.440]   Well, how you walk through the fire.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.200]   I mean, you can walk through the fire complaining along the way, or you can walk
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:17.120]   through the fire and create an example for everyone else so that the trials and
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.240]   tribulations of their own lives seem trivial because they're comparing themselves
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.520]   to the way you handle things.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.440]   Or the way you handle things with grace and dignity and discipline can show other
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.240]   people that they can handle their own life this way.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.480]   And there's beauty in that.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.120]   There really is.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.480]   And there's so much inspiration to be gathered from other people if you're a
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.000]   charitable person, if you're charitable and compassionate and you can look at
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.840]   people, even people that I don't like.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.760]   I try to look at the best aspects of how they live their life and recognize those
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.680]   aspects, admire them, give them credit for it.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.720]   There's something that we can all get out of watching the way other people live
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.320]   their lives.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.960]   So I got a chance to see you walk through the fire a little bit privately and
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.640]   publicly this year in January.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.120]   I got to ask you about that.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.320]   So there's generic conversations about cancel culture and all those kinds of
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.600]   things.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.560]   But as a human being, this to me is fascinating.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.040]   There's the N-word highlight video.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.880]   There's the criticism of the different guests, whatever the side is, on the COVID
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.040]   pandemic.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.600]   And you, I mean, there's a mass amount of attack on you.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.920]   Outside of being a public persona, outside of being a comedian, podcaster,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.560]   you're also a human being.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.120]   So how did you survive that?
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.200]   How did you sort of walk through that fire?
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.960]   Because you seem to do it with grace.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.280]   I used mushrooms.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.520]   That was one way I did it.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.760]   Really.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   What's your, as Andrew Huberman would say, what was your protocol?
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.880]   I took, it was probably less than a gram every day.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.400]   Every day.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.680]   And I did a lot of really hard working out.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:28.400]   But also, I mean, there's a great benefit to going through anything difficult.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.800]   And if you're aware, in advance and during, anything that's going to happen that's
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.200]   very difficult and troubling, the great benefit is it gives you an opportunity to
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.960]   grow, gives you an opportunity to express yourself under pressure, to show your
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.640]   character, to show who you truly are.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.760]   And it gives you an opportunity to see how you handle a very difficult situation.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:03.880]   It also was fascinating as a person that's involved in media, right?
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.960]   Because what we're doing right now is media, even though it seems like podcasts
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.240]   seem like we're just having a conversation, right?
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.200]   And they are.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.440]   And in that sense, it's kind of the purest form of media because what you're doing
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.040]   is you're doing it without any fanfare.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.200]   You're doing it without any, there's no executives looming over your head or
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.360]   network or big meetings about ratings or any of that stuff.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.680]   But it is media.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:41.080]   But what I got to see is the wiring under the machine of how the rest of media would
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.680]   try to take me out.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.600]   And, you know, like when CNN would be just be playing things over and over and back
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.080]   and forth, it was wild to watch.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.440]   What was also wild to watch was people's responses.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.200]   Because I gained 2 million subscribers during that time.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   Like the podcast never got bigger.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.200]   It just kept growing and growing.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.280]   It had never been bigger than it had been like at the end of all of it.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.920]   It just made it bigger.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:17.000]   And, you know, ultimately, when, if you've fucked up in the past or made mistakes or
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.600]   done something wrong, that gives you an opportunity to discuss those things and to
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.840]   say, to apologize if you feel the need to apologize and also to just address it.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.600]   And so people under that kind of pressure, they get it.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.840]   It's an opportunity for them to understand how you think about things honestly, how
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.040]   you actually honestly think about things.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.920]   And there's no more honesty that you get out of a person than when that person is
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.240]   under extreme duress.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.400]   You know, so I think in that sense, I mean, it's horrible to say that it's a benefit,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.360]   that it's a good thing that it happened, but it was a benefit.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.400]   Can you see how it can break a person?
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.040]   Yes.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.600]   I've gotten the chance to experience small, small attacks here and there.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.440]   Ones that get to the core of things, like even just talking to, about Russia and
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.840]   Ukraine, to Stephen Calkin or Oliver Stone, looking at different perspectives, you
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.800]   gain a relative, for me, feeling like a sizable number of people who really don't
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:25.360]   like you and say things about you that may be cut deep for a reason I don't
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.200]   understand why.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.240]   It's just my own psychology.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.080]   Well, it's also because you can't defend yourself because they're saying it and
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.400]   you're not there and you don't have any opportunity for a rebuttal.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.240]   And if you do have a rebuttal, you're doing it publicly and you're opening it up to
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.120]   the whole world to chime in.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.560]   And there's a general tendency that people have towards negativity when they're
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.920]   interacting with strangers online, especially about controversial subjects.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.480]   And even if it's only 10% of the people, it's one out of 10.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.520]   That's a lot.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.120]   That's a lot of negativity when you're dealing with thousands and thousands of
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.720]   tweets.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.240]   And I think, maybe I'm just a very self-critical person, but I hear their
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.440]   words and I probably somewhere deep inside see the truth in the criticism.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.280]   In some aspect of the criticism.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.280]   And that's why it hurts.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:23.560]   Well, it's, but it's in one aspect of you, you know, but when you're reading it, it's
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:31.080]   so it's boiled down to this one thing as if that one thing defines you totally.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.280]   Like if you've made a mistake, if you've said something that you shouldn't have
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.640]   said, or if you said something and, you know, maybe you should have considered it
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.720]   more carefully, giving the gravity of the situation, you know, that that's just a
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.080]   part of being a person.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.840]   And it's also part of being a person where you're communicating with things
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.040]   publicly in real time, thinking out loud, which is what we do.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.280]   You know, it's complex and most people don't do it.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:04.040]   And you're going to have these, you're going to have genuine hot takes where
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.400]   people just see what you said and go, why did he say that?
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.120]   Fuck him.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.560]   You know, he doesn't know anything about, he doesn't live in Ukraine.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.880]   He doesn't, you know, it was like, there's, there's people that are going to
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.960]   have takes on that, in that way.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.280]   And then there's also going to be these disingenuous people who just use any kind
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.040]   of controversial topic or subject as an opportunity for them to get clicks or
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.520]   views.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.600]   But that the number of those people can be quite large.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.440]   Quite large.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.000]   And so going back to, do you think it can destroy a person?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.800]   Cause I kind of worry about this and you're in many ways, but in this way, an
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.080]   inspiration that it didn't seem to have destroyed you, but it's.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.160]   I kept doing shows.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.720]   I kept doing standup.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.640]   I ignored everything.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.840]   I didn't read any of it.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.760]   So it is possible to just ignore.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.720]   A hundred percent.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.480]   Yes.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.040]   I ignored it all.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.600]   But you have like.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.640]   I knew it was there.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.200]   Like your family didn't bring it up.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.280]   My family was very aware of it.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.240]   My wife was aware of it.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.720]   What was the conversation like if, if your wife is aware of it, is there like a rule?
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.480]   Don't bring it, pretend it's not happening.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:07.880]   No.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.280]   Just like.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.120]   Well, I don't, I tell her don't ever read.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.160]   Past the green beans.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.720]   I don't ever let her like read negative articles to me.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.360]   You know, I don't want them.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.600]   I don't care.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.000]   I go, that's a person's opinion.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.120]   You take a person's opinion, you write it down.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.760]   It doesn't give it any more relevance.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.240]   Like that person, you know, could have had that opinion in silence.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.520]   They could have had it with some friends at dinner.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.560]   They don't like me, whatever.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.400]   I don't want to read it.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.160]   I don't want to absorb it.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.360]   I don't even know them, especially if I'm not there.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:41.400]   And especially if it's some biased and it's, it's not an objective opinion of me.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.320]   It's this, you know, they have a narrative and they want to stick to that narrative and
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.600]   they want to write an article and they piece it all together, make you look like a piece
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.000]   of shit.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.640]   And that's their prerogative.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.000]   They're completely allowed to do that.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.880]   But I know I shouldn't absorb that.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.000]   I shouldn't take that in.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.160]   You're not supposed to be taking in the opinion of the world.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.200]   You're supposed to be taking in the opinion of small groups of people that you
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.360]   encounter so that you get an understanding of how you make them feel.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.520]   And then maybe you say to yourself, maybe I come across too rude, or maybe I come
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.360]   across too insensitive, or maybe, maybe I could do better in this way or that way.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.680]   That's how we sort of shape our personalities and it's how we develop our social
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.080]   skills.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.000]   But when the people don't know you and they have this like distorted narrative of
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.080]   you and, you know, there's fucking millions of people, there's so many people, you
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.680]   can't be sane.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.160]   I think there's billions now actually.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.680]   I mean, millions of people that are like communicating about something.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.440]   Like during the height of the, you know, the attempt to cancel me or whatever that
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:46.600]   is.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.880]   I don't know how many people were involved in that.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.480]   People take this kind of stuff seriously, but the problem is the false narratives
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.600]   take hold and then you have meetings, you have groups, it builds on top of each
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.880]   other and there's this outrage and then it reaches you at some point and it can
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.440]   just have these destructive effects.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.000]   It can, but it also sometimes doesn't.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.240]   And in my case, it didn't.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.560]   Didn't work.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.920]   What lessons did you draw from that?
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   Mushrooms, exercise?
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.240]   Mushrooms and exercise.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.520]   Exercise is critical.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.800]   I don't think the mushrooms by themselves would have worked, but that's the thing
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.000]   that I use for everything is the brutal exercise.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.560]   Like my exercise routines are horrible.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.680]   And because of that, everything else is easier.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.920]   I create my own bullshit and my own bullshit is so much harder.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:43.280]   And it's not just that, it's also sauna and cold plunge and these torture sessions.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:49.120]   They, in enduring those, when you endure those, it makes enduring other things
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.760]   much easier and it's also an understanding of what's happening.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:59.520]   Like you have to know like media, you have to understand like what the hot take, you
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:05.480]   know, YouTube, social media, podcast, ecosphere is doing.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.760]   Like if they're talking about, you know, Lex Friedman said this and we have to
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.600]   comment on that and you know, Lex gets canceled in all capital letters on a
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   YouTube clip and if you, you watch that, you're fucking crazy.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.040]   What are you doing?
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.800]   Absorbing all this negativity.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.560]   It's not good for you.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.520]   You are you, you know you.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.920]   And you know, generally, if you've made a mistake, you know, generally, if people
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.840]   are upset with you, you post this awesome video on your Instagram of a woman who
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.800]   was being interviewed in 19 late 1920s, maybe.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.320]   Yes.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.240]   And she's close to a hundred years old.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.040]   So she's lived through the civil war, through world war one.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.560]   She was at the time living through the early days of the great depression.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.160]   So I was just looking back, you know, what have we as a human civilization in
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.120]   recent times survived, especially in the United States, you're talking about the
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.080]   two world wars in the 20th century, the great depression, the Spanish flu, the
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.760]   pandemic at the beginning of the 20th century.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   What do we do in the United States?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.920]   So 9/11, if you think of what are the traumatic events that shook our world,
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.560]   it's 9/11, it made us rethink our place in the world.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.600]   The pandemic.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.000]   Pandemic is a huge one.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.880]   One of the bigger ones, because it also accelerated and exacerbated our anxiety,
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.480]   which people have a certain level of anxiety already, especially sedentary
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.960]   people, they have a very high level of anxiety already because I don't think
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.880]   they're giving their body what it needs.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.400]   I don't think they're, you know, your body has certain requirements in terms of
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.480]   movement and when you deny your body those requirements, I think there's like a
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.000]   general level of anxiety that exists in almost everyone.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.960]   And then you have people obviously that have mental health issues and that also
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.680]   exacerbates the anxiety.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.280]   The lockdown exacerbated the anxiety.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.600]   Losing loved ones to the pandemic exacerbated anxiety.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:12.120]   And then there was the division, the different schools of thought, the people
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.080]   that were never going to get vaccinated no matter what, I ain't trusting it.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.680]   People that thought there was microchips in there, people that thought that, you
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.000]   know, Fauci's the demon.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.800]   And there was a lot, and there's also like political leanings.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.640]   The right-wing people tended to not want to be vaccinated, whereas the left-wing
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.480]   people, for whatever reason, all of a sudden are trusting pharmaceutical
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.280]   companies, like, explicitly.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.240]   It was weird.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.440]   It was a weird time.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:48.200]   And I think over time, as it gets analyzed and we break it down, it's going to be
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.560]   one of the weirder moments for shaping human culture, and unfortunately for
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:03.920]   throwing gasoline on this already burning fire of, you know, of conflict between
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.960]   the various factions of thought in this country, it's already a weird time,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.200]   you know, post-Trump.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.800]   Like the Trump era is also going to be one of the weirder times.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.120]   When people look back historically about the division in this country, he's such a
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:31.200]   polarizing figure that so many people felt like they could abandon their own ethics
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:39.040]   and morals and principles just to attack him and anybody who supports him because
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.280]   he is an existential threat to democracy itself.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.720]   But don't you think it's not a cause, but maybe like a symptom?
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.840]   Like it's going to get, you said it got real weird.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.960]   Maybe it's going to get weirder.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.200]   Yeah, I think it's going to get weirder.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.560]   He's going to run again.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.720]   You think he wins?
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.680]   Well, he's running against a dead man.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.720]   You know, I mean, Biden shakes hands with people that aren't even there when he
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.520]   gets off stage.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.120]   I think he's seeing ghosts.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.120]   You see him on Jimmy Kimmel the other day?
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.440]   No.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.040]   Well, he was just rambling.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:13.520]   I mean, if he was anyone else, if he was a Republican, if that was Donald Trump
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:19.480]   doing that, every fucking talk show would be screaming for him to be off the air.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.240]   And by the way, I'm not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.960]   I've had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.440]   I've said no, every time.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.360]   I don't want to help him.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.840]   I'm not interested in helping him.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.520]   The night is still young.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.160]   We'll see.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.360]   If I have him on, the night is still young?
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.200]   You think I'll have him on?
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.160]   I think you'll have him on.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.600]   Really?
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.440]   Why do you think that?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.880]   Because you'll have Putin on?
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.480]   And you're competitive as fuck.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:43.800]   No.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:55.080]   I think ultimately, I mean, you've had a lot of people that I think you may
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.240]   otherwise be skeptical.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.560]   Would I have a good conversation?
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.920]   Which I think is your metric.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.000]   You don't care about politics.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.640]   So can I have a good conversation?
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.560]   And I think you had people like Kanye on, for example, and you had a
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.600]   great conversation with him.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.720]   I think you, I think...
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.680]   But Kanye is an artist.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.520]   Like, but Kanye doing well or not doing well doesn't change
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.880]   the course of our country.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.920]   But you don't, do you really bear the responsibility of the course of our
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.520]   country based on a conversation?
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:33.680]   I think you can revitalize and rehabilitate someone's image in a
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.400]   way that is pretty shocking.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.960]   Look at the way people look at Alex Jones now, because Alex Jones has
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.360]   been on my podcast a few times.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.640]   How do they, which direction?
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.080]   The people that have watched those podcasts think he's hilarious.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.960]   And they think that he definitely fucked up with that whole Sandy Hook thing.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.040]   But he's right more than he's wrong.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.880]   And he's not an evil guy.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.840]   He's just a guy who's had some psychotic breaks in his life.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.880]   He's had some genuine mental health issues that he's addressed.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:11.000]   He's had some serious bouts of alcoholism, some serious bouts of, you know,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   substance abuse, and they've contributed to some very poor thinking.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.720]   But if you know the guy, if you get to know him, like I have, I've known him
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.720]   for more than 20 years, and if you know him on podcasts, you realize like he is
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:31.600]   genuinely trying to unearth some things that are genuinely disturbing for most
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.120]   people.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:39.000]   Like, this is a guy that was telling me about Epstein's Island fucking decade
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.200]   ago, at least he was telling me about, I was like, what?
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:48.800]   You're telling me there's a place where they bring elites to compromise them
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.760]   with underage girls and they film them?
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.280]   Really?
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:51.760]   Like, what?
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.080]   Cut the fuck out of here.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.920]   No, President Clinton's been there.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.800]   Everyone's been there.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.400]   Like, what?
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.760]   It sounds like nonsense.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.280]   And not only is it true, but people keep getting fucking murdered for it.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.240]   Did you see that latest Clinton adviser that got murdered about it?
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.680]   Hung with an extension cord, shot himself in the chest 30 miles from his house,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.320]   and they're calling it a suicide.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.760]   And now even Elon Musk is asking, where's the clientele list?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.640]   We should probably see who's been to that island.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.600]   Yeah, we should probably see who's been to that island.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:28.000]   And there's probably more of those kind of things out there that haven't been
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.680]   exposed.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:35.800]   Yeah, but sort of to push back, you had those conversations with Alex Jones.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.640]   Wouldn't you be able to have the same kind of conversation with Donald Trump?
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.160]   That's the problem.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.040]   No, it's not the problem.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.600]   You revealed that Alex Jones is a human being.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.680]   He's fucked up.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.280]   He has demons in his head.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:53.120]   He's obviously chaotic all over the place, but there's some wisdom to the
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.520]   perspective he takes on the world.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:00.200]   Even though he is often full of shit, he's able to predict certain things that
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.320]   very few people are willing to bring up.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.920]   So isn't Trump the same way?
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.880]   Fucked up person, egomaniac, whatever personality things you can talk about.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.320]   Isn't it worthwhile to lay it out?
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:18.560]   Like, if you listen to interviews of Trump, who has the balls to call him out
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.280]   on this bullshit?
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.160]   Chris Walls did.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.240]   No, calling out somebody on their bullshit is easy when you're just being
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.000]   adversarial.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.840]   But as a person who is genuinely empathetically trying to understand, I
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   think you're really good at that.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.920]   Like, you pulled him in.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.360]   I don't know if he would genuinely be there.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.120]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.760]   Like, I think he would be putting on a performance.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.440]   And that's probably...
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.800]   You don't think he can break through that in like 30 minutes?
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.120]   I'd need more time than that.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.200]   And he doesn't do any drugs.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.480]   That's the thing about Alex.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.920]   You can get Alex high, get him drunk, and he'll start talking about
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.840]   interdimensional child molesters.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.080]   You know, and then you get the real Alex.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.920]   Or maybe you have somebody else on as well to introduce chaos, like Alex.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.240]   There'd have to be one or...
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.040]   I would have to be just me and him.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.800]   I would have to...
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.080]   That would be a focused thing.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.880]   I would have to like really take time with Trump.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:19.080]   But also I'm not well-versed enough politically to know all of the corruption
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:25.920]   that's been alleged and to understand what the whole Russiagate stuff, what's real.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.480]   Like how much of it...
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:33.000]   It's clear that there is more than one organization that's involved in
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.640]   communicating with Russia before the 2016 elections.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.800]   It's pretty clear that the Clinton administration was involved.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.440]   It's pretty clear that the Trump administration had some
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.840]   communication with some people in Russia.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   It's pretty clear that Hunter Biden had some very suspicious dealings in Ukraine.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.800]   And there's a lot going on there, man.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.160]   And it's hard for anybody to parse.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.080]   It's really hard for anybody, and especially to have an objective
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.520]   assessment of exactly what's going on.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.920]   And then to be able to do that and broadcast it publicly.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.400]   That's quite a project.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.200]   And I think if you really want to do that correctly, it's something that I would
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.200]   have to research for a long time and to really, really...
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.480]   And I don't have that kind of time.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:24.080]   Not for maybe for certain people that you're really curious about.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.040]   Like you have that kind of time for Bob Lazar.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.760]   Yes.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.480]   Yes.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.440]   But maybe not for Donald Trump.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.560]   No, that's different.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:38.160]   Because Bob Lazar, what he's talking about, I wanted to know, with the Bob Lazar thing,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.120]   I wanted to know, first of all, I want to be around him and see if I could smell bullshit.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.600]   Did you?
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.080]   No.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.080]   Okay.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.040]   No, I didn't, man.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.280]   That was what's weird about it.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.600]   Not only did I not smell bullshit, I went over all of his interviews.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.040]   I went over...
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.640]   He hasn't done a lot, but he's done enough.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.520]   And he's done them over the course of 30 plus years.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:04.240]   And it's alarming how consistent his story is, which is really weird when you think
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:10.000]   about, you're talking about back engineering alien crafts and working on a, you know, a
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.640]   top secret government test site that's carved into the side of a mountain to
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.440]   camouflage it from satellites.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:23.640]   It's such a wacky story, but the guy really did work at Los Alamos Labs.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.520]   He really is a propulsions expert.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   He really is a scientist.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.720]   Did he really work on back engineering UFOs?
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.280]   I don't know.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:38.600]   But the way he described their motion is exactly like what's been observed by some
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.200]   of these pilots that have these videos that they've captured.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.360]   And I just love that, like NASA, I've been hearing from a bunch of folks who they're
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:52.040]   legitimately like funding research and there's people really taking the seriously of
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.720]   UFO sightings, investigating them.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.160]   Like adding more and more sensors to collect data from just observing at higher and
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:00.960]   higher definitions.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.680]   It's cool to finally see that.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.200]   And he was one of the early people, whether he's full of shit or not, that kind of
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.360]   forced people to start taking this kind of, these topics seriously.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:17.280]   Or at least force people to have conversations about them and maybe attempt to debunk
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.880]   them because it seems so preposterous, but then get sucked down the rabbit hole and
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.600]   start going, "Hmm, maybe."
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.360]   It's the thing is like the Fermi paradox, like where are they, right?
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:34.080]   And when you take into account just the sheer raw numbers, the vast majority of
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.360]   people objectively assume that there is life out there.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.680]   The vast majority.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.480]   Well, if you really take into account what we understand about the universe itself,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.840]   what we understand about the concept of infinity and the way Neil deGrasse Tyson
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:57.080]   has explained it to me is that not only are there life forms out there, but there's
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.600]   you.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.480]   You are out there.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:04.280]   Infinity is so large that Lex Friedman exists and doesn't just exist, but exists
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.120]   an infinite number of times.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:13.200]   Like the amount of interactions that cells and molecules, the same exact interactions
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.240]   that have happened here on earth have happened in the exact same order.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.920]   An infinite number of times in the cosmos.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.600]   Well, first of all, it's not certain that that's true.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.160]   It's possible.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:32.920]   Like Sean Carroll, especially with quantum mechanics, based on certain
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.760]   interpretation of quantum mechanics, that's very possible.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.960]   But the question is, can you access those universes?
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.680]   Right.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.760]   How far away are they?
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.680]   The more specific practical question is this local pocket of the universe, our
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   galaxy or neighboring galaxies, are there aliens there?
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.880]   What did they look like?
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.680]   Are they?
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:29:00.840]   So you can have this panspermia idea where a much larger, like daddy
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:08.200]   civilization, like rolled by and just planted a few aliens at a similar time.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.160]   Like Prometheus.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.720]   Yes.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.400]   A different, you know, throughout the galaxy.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.720]   And those are the ones we might be interacting with.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:20.480]   They're all kind of dumb as we are relatively, you know, maybe a few million
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.160]   years apart and then those are the ones we're interacting with and then we have
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.720]   a chance to actually connect with them and communicate with them.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.480]   Or it could be like much more wide open and you have these gigantic alien
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.960]   civilizations that are expanding very, very quickly.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.920]   And the interesting thing is when you look up at the sky and you see the stars,
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.600]   that's light from those stars, we might not be seeing the alien civilizations
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.160]   until they're already here.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.840]   Meaning like you start expanding.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.680]   Once you get really good at expanding, you're going to be expanding
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.920]   very close to the speed of light.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.280]   So right now we don't see much in the sky, but there could be one night, one
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.160]   day we wake up and it's just like everywhere and they're here.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:03.640]   Right.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.000]   Right.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.800]   Because the amount of time the light takes to reach us.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:14.160]   And then the thing that I've been really fascinated by is these alternative forms
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.120]   of transportation that they're discussing.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:25.160]   Like the ability to harness wormholes and the ability to do things that a type three
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.560]   civilization is capable of.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.800]   I had Michio Kaku on my podcast recently.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.760]   Fantastic.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.480]   Love that guy.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:39.440]   He's so good at taking extremely complex concepts and boiling them down for
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.080]   digestion and saying them in a way that other people can appreciate.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:49.200]   And not being hesitant about saying wild, crazy shit that's out there, but grounded
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.920]   in what's actually possible.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.160]   He's all in on this UFO phenomenon now.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.560]   He's like, now the burden of proof is to people for people to come up with some
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.760]   sort of a conventional explanation for these things.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:07.240]   He goes, because these things are defying all the concepts of physics that we
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.760]   currently know in terms of what our capabilities are and propulsion systems
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.040]   and so many other things that, you know, what we know about what current science
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.440]   is capable of reproducing.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.800]   As far as what we know.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:26.640]   The problem is like these military projects that are top secret.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.600]   Like how much money do they have?
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.640]   They have a lot of money.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.120]   Like, but is it possible, and maybe you could speak to this.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.680]   Is it possible that there could be some propulsion systems that have been
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.720]   developed and implemented that are far beyond just the simple burning of rocket
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.760]   fuel, pushing the fire out the back, which forces the rocket at extreme speeds
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.360]   forward, that's something that does harness gravity, something that can
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:02.120]   distort space and time and can make travel from one point to another
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.000]   preposterously fast?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.080]   Well, not only is it possible, I think it's likely that that kind of stuff
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.880]   would be kept a secret.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:19.240]   It's just everything you see about these, about the way either if it's
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:24.000]   contractors like Lockheed Martin, or if it's DOD, the actual departments of
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.640]   defense, they operate in complete secrecy.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.640]   Just even looking at the history of the stealth fighter, just even stealth
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.320]   technology was kept a secret for a very, very long time.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:42.080]   And not until you're ready to use it and need to use it, does it become public
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.000]   and not officially public, it just is being detected out in the wild.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.840]   So there's going to be a process where you're secretly testing it.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.040]   And that might creep up, which is maybe what we're seeing.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:59.120]   And then it's waiting for the next big war, the next big reason to use the
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.480]   thing.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.120]   And so, yeah, there's definitely technologies now.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.600]   There might not be propulsion technologies, there could be AI
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:12.240]   surveillance technologies, there could be different kinds of stealth drones.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:19.440]   There could be, it could be also in cyberspace, like cyber war weapons, all
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.920]   that kind of stuff.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.720]   They're obviously going to be kept secret.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.760]   I'm very skeptical lately.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.440]   And the reason why I'm skeptical is the government keeps talking about it.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.720]   The Pentagon keeps talking about it.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.240]   NASA keeps talking about it.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.920]   In which direction are you skeptical?
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.040]   I'm skeptical that it's, they're aliens.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.720]   I think most likely it's a smoke screen.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.800]   And most likely these are some sort of like incredibly advanced drones that
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.840]   they've developed that they want to pretend don't exist.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.280]   That seems the more likely scenario.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.560]   Because otherwise, my take is like, what's the benefit of them discussing
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.240]   these things?
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.400]   Like, what's the benefit of them discussing these things openly?
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:03.840]   These are, you know, the way they described it, off-world crafts, not made
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.560]   from this earth.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.880]   Like, why?
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.600]   Why would they tell us that?
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:16.000]   I mean, unless there's an imminent danger of us being invaded and they want to
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.160]   prepare people so they don't freak out as much.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.040]   You know, like maybe freak them out a little bit, say that publicly.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.600]   The New York Times article, the Pentagon discussing it, all these different
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:26.760]   things.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.520]   Test the waters.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.320]   Well, let people know that this is a thing.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.800]   Or my take is like, I don't think they do that.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.040]   I don't think they tell us.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.000]   I think they, I think, I think the government has a lot of contempt for the
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.640]   citizens.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.720]   I really do.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.920]   I think they have contempt for our intelligence.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.360]   They have contempt for our need to know things.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.840]   And I also think they think that they are running us.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.080]   It's not, we're all in this together and the government works for the people and
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.680]   the government is of the people.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.760]   I don't think they think that way.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:05.160]   The basic idea is you can't trust the populace to govern itself because we're a
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:05.920]   bunch of idiots.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.880]   I think that's accurate.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.240]   Well, they're not wrong, but they're also idiots.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.280]   Power-hungry idiots.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.680]   I don't think they're, I don't think everyone's an idiot, but I think there
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.760]   are enough idiots that it becomes a real problem if you're completely honest about
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.560]   everything you do.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:27.040]   And you know, you don't want to let everybody weigh in about things that are
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.000]   incredibly complex and that most people are ignorant of.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.120]   And on top of that, there's this machine of intelligence.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.280]   I've recently been reading a lot about the KGB, about the FSB.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.800]   So I've, several things sparked my curiosity.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.040]   So one, I'm traveling to Ukraine and to Moscow.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.280]   And because of that, I started to sort of ask practical questions of myself, just
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.120]   traveling, all those kinds of things.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.280]   So I started reading a lot about the KGB.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.040]   Jack Barsky has a book on this.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.840]   I talked to him.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.680]   And you start to realize, you probably looked into some of this, but you just
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.880]   start to realize the scale of surveillance and manipulation.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:09.880]   Now, a lot of them also talk about the incompetence of those organizations.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.560]   The usual bureaucracy creeps in.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:18.880]   But the point is, it seems like there's no line they're not willing to cross for
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.920]   the purpose of gathering intelligence, for the purpose of controlling people in
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.240]   order to gather intelligence.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.800]   Now this is MI6, FSB.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.760]   There's not much information about the FSB or the GRU, but the KGB.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.480]   So we're always like 20 years behind or more on the actual information.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:46.520]   And so I started to wonder, so I have not officially been contacted by any
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:52.880]   intelligence agency, but I started to wonder, well, is there somebody I know
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:59.840]   that's doing that, undercover CIA or undercover FSB, undercover anything?
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.960]   You probably do.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.080]   Have you asked yourself this question?
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.400]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.240]   People that have been on my podcast.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.560]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.280]   You think there was actually a guest that may have been?
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.120]   A hundred percent.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:11.840]   Oh man.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.760]   I would imagine.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.480]   Would you know?
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.720]   I have suspicions.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.360]   Do you care?
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.240]   Is this?
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:23.520]   I mean, it depends on what they're attempting to do, right?
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.960]   Like if I felt like there was some deception involved and they were trying
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:33.480]   to use the podcast to manipulate a narrative in a deceptive way to trick
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.880]   people into things, yeah, I would care.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.840]   But this is exactly what, those are the kinds of things they do.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.400]   They do plant narratives.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   I mean, I would imagine if you have the number one podcast in the world, that
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.160]   people would want to infiltrate that.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.280]   There's probably meetings in all major intelligence agencies about, okay, what
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.560]   are the large platforms?
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.680]   How do we, how do we spread the message?
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.080]   Well, I mean, that's the thing that really emerged when we're talking about
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:10.200]   during my cancellation, that there's a clear, there's no objective analysis
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.160]   of this in mainstream media.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.520]   There's clear narratives that they're trying to push forward to, whether it's
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:25.320]   to promote certain ideas or to diminish the power and reach of people who are
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:31.440]   mavericks or people who, who are, you know, who aren't connected to a system
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.840]   that you can't compromise.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.480]   That's where it gets dangerous, right?
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.880]   Where it gets dangerous is when someone has the largest reach, but is also
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:47.480]   completely detached and clearly is independent in the sense of independent
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.720]   thinking has on whoever he wants.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.920]   But your mind can still be manipulated.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.840]   I guess I can.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.360]   I mean, I guess everybody can be manipulated a certain way.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.160]   I manipulate my own mind, I'm sure too.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.440]   But I also spend a lot of time thinking about what I think, you know, I don't
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.640]   just accept things like, like the UFO thing.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:11.760]   Like I was all in for a while and now I'm like, man, something smells fishy.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.240]   I'm in it.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.400]   And then I'm thinking like, why, here's my problem with the UFO thing.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.840]   I want it to be real so bad.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.480]   That's my problem with it.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.680]   I'm such a sucker.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.200]   I want it to be real so bad, you know?
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.320]   And that's, that's a problem for me because I'm aware of it.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.280]   And so then I stop and think about like, what is, what, what is my desire
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   for UFO truth to be exposed?
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.360]   Well, it's cause it's fun.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.720]   You know, that's what it is.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.080]   So I have a desire to, for it to be real.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.480]   And I mean, I've talked to, I talked to a bunch of folks about this.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:56.520]   So those with connection with DOD, and they do draw lines between people
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.360]   that are full of shit and people who are not.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.200]   There's a lot of people in the public sphere that they say are full of shit.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.160]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.560]   And then you have to kind of tell the difference.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.640]   CNN, watch them talk.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.240]   Well, I mean, even, yes, that picture.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.040]   But I meant on the UFO topic.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:13.880]   Oh, the UFO topic.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.560]   There's certain individuals that are like, okay, they're just like using this.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.840]   In fact, like people who are not full of shit are often very quiet.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.680]   Right.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.440]   Which is why, you know, even Bob Lazar is an interesting story
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.560]   because he was trying to be quiet for the longest time.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.200]   Well, he was worried about his own life, according to Bob.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.040]   And that's why he went public with it.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.840]   And initially, the first videos he did with George Knapp,
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.440]   they hid his identity.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.760]   And then he felt like that wasn't enough.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.760]   And he really needed to expose his own identity just to protect his life.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.960]   Which is a great story, you know, so you got to go, well, that seems so juicy.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.360]   I want to buy into it.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.400]   And that's where I get nervous.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:53.800]   You don't know.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.240]   You don't know who to trust in this world.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:55.960]   Right, exactly.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.920]   How do you figure that out?
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.840]   How do you figure out who to trust in your life?
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.560]   You're Joe Rogan.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.760]   A lot of people want to be close to you.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.280]   CIA agents, FSB agents, people that want...
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.160]   I'm friends with a former CIA agent, Mike Baker,
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.720]   who's been on my podcast a bunch of times.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.840]   Allegedly former.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.400]   Former.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.000]   Think about that.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.160]   He's air quotes former.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.040]   I don't believe he's former.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.840]   I'm sure he has some connection to him.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.640]   I also believe he's a good guy.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.280]   But I gain a lot of very intelligent
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.200]   and well-informed insights from him as to how things work.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.880]   And I think--
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.840]   yeah, I'm sure he doesn't tell me everything about everything.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.960]   But he's told me enough where I think
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.800]   I can understand things better from talking to him about how
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:46.200]   the way the elves work under the machine.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.680]   What about friends?
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.080]   How do you know if you can trust?
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.280]   Well, most of my friends are old friends.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:51.800]   Time.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.480]   So time is the thing.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.000]   Like just going through shit together.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.920]   Yeah, and also people that--
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.480]   first of all, comics.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   You can trust comics?
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.960]   Is that how that works?
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.240]   Comics are pretty trustworthy.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.920]   The good ones, the really good ones.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   There's not that many of us.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:14.560]   If there's 1,000 professional comics on Earth, I'd be stunned.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.360]   I'd be stunned.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.800]   I don't even think there's 1,000.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.400]   Real professionals who you get booked all the time,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.120]   headline weekends at clubs and theaters and arenas.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.880]   And then there's levels to that, right?
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.200]   There's the guys who are middle acts, who
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   kind of barely scrape by.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.160]   And then how many headliners are there?
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.800]   How many really funny headliners that I would say--
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.400]   Lex, you tell me you're going to be in Cincinnati.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.240]   Hey, this person's playing at this club.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.520]   Should I go see them?
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.720]   I'd be like, eh.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.000]   How many people would I give the recommendation to?
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.080]   And then how many people sell out theaters?
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.480]   How many people sell out arenas?
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.080]   There's not that fucking many.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.360]   So those people, at the levels of comedy
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.120]   where you've been doing stand-up for 20 years,
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.880]   there's a certain amount of honesty
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.960]   and a certain amount of understanding of each other
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.880]   that we all have.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.560]   Oh, so that process of becoming a great comic
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.160]   is humbling in the way like jujitsu is humbling.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.800]   Very similar.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.160]   You've eaten so much shit that somehow, even if you're insane,
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.080]   even if you're chaotic, even in the way--
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.000]   even if you're full of shit, you lie a lot,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.600]   all those kinds of things, underneath it,
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.040]   there's a good human.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.720]   You could be surface bullshitter,
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.680]   but on important things, you're trustworthy.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.720]   Hopefully.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.120]   I mean, if you're not, then people shy away from you.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.920]   And there are people like that, too, that are really successful,
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.200]   but that are what I call islands.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.800]   I've talked to other comics about that.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.680]   You don't want to be an island, because there's
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.520]   these people that aren't attached to the rest of the community,
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.400]   and they're doing well on their own.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.280]   And usually, they have one opening act.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.680]   They bring with them on the road.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.960]   They've worked with forever, and they
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.280]   don't have comedy friends.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.560]   And those people are miserable, because they can't relate.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.120]   Sometimes fame in itself is isolating.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.760]   So you have to actually do a lot of work
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.280]   and make sure it doesn't isolate you.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.560]   Because if you become successful,
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.040]   people start wanting stuff from you.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.600]   And then sometimes you want to push them away because of that,
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.840]   as opposed to connect with them.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.720]   Yeah, I don't enjoy it when people want things from me.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.400]   It's not fun.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.480]   You just ignore it.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.600]   Yeah, it's fucking too heavy.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.640]   They want too much.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.400]   And it's too much of a disproportionate relationship.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.360]   It's too unbalanced.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.560]   Because there are people where you
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.960]   could tell that they're working towards something.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   They're working towards an angle.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.140]   And they want to be close to you,
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.400]   because you will benefit them.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.840]   And then there's other people that are just--
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.160]   there's not that many of us.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.560]   And so we all want to hang out together.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.480]   One of the podcasts I love the most
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.680]   is this podcast I do called Protect Our Parks.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.640]   It's a thing I do with Ari Shafir, Shane Gillis,
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.280]   and Mark Nolan.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:01.880]   That's great.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.920]   It's so fun, because we just get obliterated.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.360]   And we talk so much shit.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.840]   There's conversations after that podcast where I go, hey, man,
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.560]   we got to cut that part out.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.640]   Because Shane will go too far.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.680]   He'll go too crazy.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.440]   But we're just making each other laugh.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.920]   And it's just fun.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.320]   And it's like that kind of camaraderie between real comics
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.560]   is very precious to me.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.120]   My favorite part of that is the non sequitur stuff
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.480]   from Mark Norman.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.720]   And you guys get so trashed that you don't even
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.260]   understand what the hell he's talking about.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.120]   But it's funny to the listener, because he's still on point.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.480]   That guy is sharp.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.560]   He's so good.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.440]   He's got that Midge Hedberg quality.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.440]   Yes.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.520]   Well, he's such a dedicated comic.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.360]   He loves comedy so much.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.120]   That's one of the things I love about him.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.160]   He's like, comedy!
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.520]   He gets excited.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   He loves it.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.920]   As does Shane, and as does Ari.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.680]   They really love it.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.960]   So there's that.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.200]   I have friends in that way.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.840]   And I have martial arts friends who are some of the--
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.520]   also, the thing about being humbled, how things like jujitsu
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.600]   will humble you.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   Martial arts friends, they know who's been through it.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.400]   They know who really has gone through the gauntlet
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.440]   and emerged on the other end a better person.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.880]   Well, you said there's very few of us.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.280]   Let's have the goat discussion.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.680]   You're not going to pick anybody,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.920]   but who are the greats of comedy?
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.360]   Who's the greatest comic of all time?
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.520]   I don't think there is a greatest comic of all time.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.440]   Is it Norm Macdonald?
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.920]   Norm Macdonald was one of the greats, for sure.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.280]   Well, by the way, actually, on that topic, what do you
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.200]   think about his--
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.840]   I think as a person who is fascinated by the fear of death
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.440]   and death, I think it was a truly genius thing
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.240]   to release a special after you're dead.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.440]   I don't know how that worked.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.000]   I haven't seen the special of you.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.720]   Yeah, it's called, I think, Nothing Special.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.840]   Which sounds like something Norm would say.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.360]   And it's basically him in front of--
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.480]   I mean, I imagine he wouldn't want to edit it that way,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.560]   because it's made to look nicer than I think he probably
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.280]   would have preferred it.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.680]   But it's him in front of the screen, like in a Zoom call,
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.600]   doing jokes without cold.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.080]   Really?
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.800]   And somehow, given his dry, dark humor,
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.200]   it works, because it's almost making fun of itself,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.440]   almost making fun of that hole that we were stuck alone
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.080]   inside.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.400]   And because he's still acting as if he's
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.920]   in front of the audience, and is almost making fun of the fact
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.600]   that this is what we're forced to do.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.640]   I mean, it's quite genius.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.600]   It's really well done.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.080]   The jokes are really good.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.600]   But it also makes you realize how important laughter
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.320]   is from the audience, the energy from the audience.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.720]   But there's also an intimacy, because it's just you and him.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.120]   Because you're listening to it.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.280]   You know there's no audience.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:02.800]   I don't know.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.600]   I think it's quite genius.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.720]   And he is, of course--
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.360]   there's certain comics that are like, not only are they funny,
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.960]   but they're truly unique.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:19.400]   Not in terms of friendship and all that kind of stuff,
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.200]   but in terms of comedy, they're an island.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.080]   Mitch Hedberg probably is that.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.680]   Of course, a lot of people then start to imitate them,
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.160]   and so on.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.280]   Stephen Wright.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.680]   Stephen Wright.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.880]   I mean, there's people who are like--
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.840]   Dave Chappelle, who's probably one of the greats.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.360]   But he's just raw funny.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.040]   I don't know if he's an island.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.160]   He's just raw.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.520]   Yeah, I know what you're saying.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.400]   An outlier, a unique individual.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.040]   Yeah, he's just great.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.120]   Norm was definitely unique in his greatness.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.600]   There's only one Norm, who's got a very specific style.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.120]   Is there a reason you guys weren't--
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.000]   it doesn't seem like you guys were close.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.040]   I mean, I loved him.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:00.680]   He was great.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.040]   I always enjoyed talking to him.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.680]   We just didn't work together that often.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.280]   We weren't around each other that often.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.280]   That's all it was.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.200]   But it wasn't like--
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.720]   I loved him, though.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.560]   He was a great guy.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.000]   I had a funny story about Norm.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.280]   Twice, just randomly, I was on airplanes next to him,
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.320]   seated right next to him.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.000]   Just totally random.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.360]   And one time, we're on this airplane,
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.600]   and we're having this talk.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.960]   And I was like, yeah, I quit smoking.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.960]   I was smoking a lot, and just terrible, terrible smoking.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.440]   It's terrible for you.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.920]   And we have this great conversation.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.240]   We get off the plane.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.720]   And he sprints towards a store and buys cigarettes,
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.440]   like in the airport, and is lighting it
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.760]   on the way out the door.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.320]   And I go, I thought you quit smoking.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   He goes, yeah, I did.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.040]   But all that talking about smoking
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.280]   made me want to smoke again.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.920]   Before he's getting through the door of the airport,
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.760]   he's lighting it up.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.080]   I can't wait.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.480]   He can't wait to get that cigarette in him.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.560]   He's just so crazy and impulsive and loved to gamble.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.000]   He loved gambling.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.640]   And in that way, he embodied the joke.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.560]   You can't even tell.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:19.240]   There's certain people just live in a non sequitur,
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.760]   ridiculous, absurd, funny way.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   Yeah, that was him.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.080]   Non-stop.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.280]   There was nothing artificial about Norm.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.040]   That was who he was.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.280]   His brilliance was his essence.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.440]   That was who he was.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:39.240]   But in terms of the greats, the godfather of it
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.280]   all is Lenny Bruce.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.120]   I have a bunch of Lenny Bruce concert posters at my house
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.800]   and photos that I have framed.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.400]   And Whitney Cummings actually gave me
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.920]   this brilliant photo of him when he got arrested for one
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.400]   of the times, when he got arrested
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.960]   for saying obscene jokes.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.640]   He was the most important figure in the early days of comedy
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.120]   because he essentially gave birth
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.800]   to the modern art form of stand-up comedy.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.240]   Before that, it was a bunch of guys
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.880]   that were hosting shows, and they would tell jokes.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.840]   They would just like, two guys walking to a bar,
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.000]   that kind of stuff.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.720]   And he would talk about social issues.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.240]   He would talk about life.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.640]   He would talk about language.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.400]   He would talk about laws.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.600]   And it was just, he was the very first guy
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.840]   who did modern stand-up.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:39.280]   And what's fascinating is if you go and you try to watch it,
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.200]   if you try to watch Lenny Bruce today,
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:46.240]   it doesn't work because society has evolved.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.120]   In many ways, art is a window, especially like pop culture
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:57.600]   or modern, at the time, culture art,
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.680]   art that discusses culture, is a window into that time period.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.400]   It's a little bit of a time machine.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.880]   So you get to like, you have to put yourself,
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.600]   like what was it like to be in 1963?
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.960]   Like what was he, in 1963, what was this
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.520]   like to hear him say this?
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.560]   And the civilization that existed in 1963,
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.600]   although it looked pretty similar,
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.000]   they're all driving cars and they're all wearing suits
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.920]   and it seems normal.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.040]   It's a different world.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.240]   And the things that he was saying that are so taboo
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.440]   are so normal today that they're not shocking.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.520]   And it's not that good.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.480]   It's not that funny.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.040]   - Yeah, you have to do the same kind of stuff for,
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.000]   like there's D.H. Lawrence has a book called
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.560]   "Lady Shadowy's Lover."
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.720]   And I know it sounds ridiculous,
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.480]   but it was one of the early books,
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:52.360]   I believe it over a century ago,
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:55.080]   that was very controversial for its sexual content.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.440]   It's sort of one of the great books
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.320]   because it dared to actually talk about
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:01.720]   a woman cheating on her husband
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.840]   and do so in the highest form.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.080]   And the same thing with "Gulag Archipelago,"
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:11.000]   talking about some of the darkest aspects of human history
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   right when all of that stuff is forbidden,
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.120]   when it's banned.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.960]   'Cause now it's like, yes, we all know this history,
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.680]   but when in the middle of it,
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.000]   when you're risking your own life,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.240]   when you're risking your book being banned or burned
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:28.040]   or you being in prison, that's when it matters,
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.400]   like taking that risk.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.560]   - Yeah, and no one took that risk more than Lenny Bruce.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.000]   Lenny Bruce was arrested many, many times.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.240]   And ultimately, it wound up costing him his life.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.440]   I mean, he died on the bathroom floor, shooting heroin
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.800]   and trying to cope with all the lawsuits
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.720]   that he was going through.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.960]   I mean, this guy was constantly being arrested
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.120]   and constantly going through lawsuits.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.120]   And then his comedy deteriorated horribly.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.480]   There's some footage of him towards the end of his career
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.960]   where he essentially would go on stage with legal papers
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.720]   and read from the legal papers about his case.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.360]   From then, it's Richard Pryor.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.800]   From him, then the next great is Richard Pryor.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:09.440]   And he had the most profound impact on me when I was a kid.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.400]   When I was 15 years old,
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.640]   my parents took me to see "Live at the Sunset Strip,"
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.880]   which is a Richard Pryor's concert film.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:20.880]   And I remember very distinctly being in that audience
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.400]   and laughing and looking around at all the people
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.600]   in the audience who were like falling out of their chairs,
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.320]   just dying laughing, just swaying back and forth.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.680]   And I was laughing hard too.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.840]   And I was like, my God, this guy's doing this
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.360]   just by talking.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.400]   And I thought of all the great movies that I'd seen
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.200]   that I loved that were hilarious comedy movies.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.240]   And I was like, nothing that I've ever seen
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.520]   is as funny as this.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.680]   And all he's doing is talking.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.640]   And that planted a seed in my head
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.760]   for my love of standup comedy
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.240]   and my curiosity about the art form.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.960]   And that's what got me interested in watching it
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.520]   on television and then ultimately going to open mic nights
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.240]   and then eventually doing it.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.080]   - I've actually been going to open mics a lot recently,
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.040]   just listening. - Oh.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.240]   For psychological examinations of people.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:14.360]   - No, it's actually really inspiring to me
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.560]   to see people that, you know, some are funny,
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.280]   some are not so funny, unapologetically trying.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.320]   - Yeah. - Putting it all out there
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.880]   night after night, like eating shit.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.400]   - Yeah. - My favorite is when,
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.200]   you know, you're talking about like five people
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:35.680]   in the audience and the jokes are just not landing.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.040]   (Luke laughing)
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.520]   And they still, I don't know,
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.600]   it feels like even just empathetically,
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.000]   there's few things as difficult as that.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.400]   - It's hard.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.560]   I still remember those days. - It's inspiring.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.840]   - Many comics will say this,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.720]   and I think Dane Cook was the first person
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.160]   I heard say it publicly,
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.880]   that if he ever had to go back and do it again,
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   like from scratch, doesn't think he could do it,
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:02.400]   doesn't think he could endure the struggle of open mic
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.600]   to, you know, ultimately to success.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.020]   And the numbers of people that try it
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:13.020]   and fail versus try and succeed are off the charts.
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.520]   I don't know if there's any other art form
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.560]   that has such a low rate of success.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.440]   - 'Cause it's psychological, it's torture.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.720]   - It is torture, and it's also not something you can learn.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:27.800]   Like, here's the thing, like, if you play guitar,
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.580]   you can learn to play guitar.
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.800]   Someone can teach you the chords.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.800]   And if you do it, you could do "All Along the Watchtower,"
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.440]   you could play it.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.600]   You can't teach someone how to do comedy.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.020]   - You think it's, you're funny or not,
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:44.800]   or can you still figure it out?
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.640]   Like, can you still learn?
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.160]   - Yeah, you can figure it out, yeah.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:51.600]   - Can you start being unfunny and become funny?
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.280]   - Yes, it's possible.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.840]   It's not easy, though.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.520]   - You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.640]   - You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit,
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.340]   and you're gonna have to examine why you're not funny.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.260]   And you're gonna have to spend a lot of time
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.200]   with uncomfortable thoughts
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.480]   and try to figure out what it is.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.580]   Like, what's missing?
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:13.260]   Could you edit your stuff and make it better?
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.220]   Maybe you need to do drugs.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.860]   Maybe you need to get involved in psychedelic drugs
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:21.680]   and rethink the way you interface with reality itself.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.800]   Maybe you need your heart broken.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.400]   Maybe you need to be in love.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.280]   Maybe, there's a lot of maybes there.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.900]   Maybe you just need more life experience.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.500]   But when I started comedy, I was 21, and I was a moron.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:36.220]   I had no information.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:38.540]   I could do impressions of people,
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.120]   and I could talk about sex.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.700]   Those are the things that I was interested in back then.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.500]   I mean, if I was talking philosophically,
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.380]   I didn't have a philosophy.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:50.380]   I didn't have a unique perspective on life.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.140]   I hadn't experienced much.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.140]   - So every time you bomb,
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:56.620]   it forces you to introspect, to ask questions of yourself,
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.760]   and then that's how you actually develop a philosophy
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.900]   of what you actually believe.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:03.300]   - You learn through doing.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.100]   And I think you could say that about podcasting, too.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.060]   You know, I'm certainly way better at having conversations
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:11.780]   than I ever was when I first started doing comedy.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.020]   Or, excuse me, when I first started doing podcasts.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.580]   - You learn, stick with it, kid,
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:18.580]   because one day you'll be able to interview Donald Trump.
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:22.660]   You'd be mad enough to handle that conversation.
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:25.180]   How hard is it to do?
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.380]   'Cause I've been really curious.
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:29.660]   It's been on my bucket list because I'm terrified.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.220]   I wanna do everything I'm terrified of.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:32.220]   - You gotta do standup?
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:37.220]   - No, but I do wanna do one five-minute open mic.
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.940]   - Why don't you do "Kill Tony"?
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.060]   - How hard is it to do five minutes, would you say?
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.500]   - It's hard.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.260]   Well, it depends on how long you've been thinking
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.660]   about doing comedy.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.020]   It depends on how you look at things.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.020]   And also depends on your style of comedy.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:53.100]   The most difficult style of comedy is,
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.100]   I think, Stephen Wright's style
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.140]   is probably the most difficult style of comedy,
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.740]   complete non sequiturs.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.940]   One subject doesn't lead into the next.
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.220]   There's no flow to it.
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.140]   It's just, I noticed this, I noticed that.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   And then there's this, and then there's that.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:10.060]   And that's hard to memorize.
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.980]   And it's really hard to piece together
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:14.900]   an hour of non sequiturs.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.060]   - But it's easier because you can rely on the joke.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.820]   It sits more with the joke.
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:24.360]   Like, whether you're funny or not is on the actual material
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.860]   versus like the timing and the energy,
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.740]   the dance with the audience, right?
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.420]   'Cause like, if you don't have the raw jokes,
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.520]   like Stephen Wright does or Mitch Hedberg,
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.380]   then you have to, it's all about the delivery.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.860]   - Yeah, and yeah, they either kill or they bomb.
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.660]   - Is it random?
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:44.500]   - Whether they kill or bomb?
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.380]   - Yeah.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.620]   - Well, I mean-- - In the beginning, I mean.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.460]   - You're essentially a different person
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.780]   every day of your life.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:54.100]   You know, you're similar, but you're more tired,
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:58.300]   you're more rested, you're exhausted, you're refreshed,
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.500]   you have vitamins and food nourishment in your system,
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.380]   you just get your heart broken, you haven't slept in days.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.580]   You're a different person all the time.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.480]   And you go onto that stage,
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:14.540]   you're in the neighborhood of who Lex Friedman is.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.860]   You're in the Lex Friedman neighborhood.
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.420]   Which Lex Friedman am I gonna get?
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.260]   - Yeah.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.100]   - You know?
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.220]   - Energy levels. - Yeah.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.700]   - It depends, it all depends.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.860]   But oh, the other thing with "Kill Tony" is it's videotaped.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:26.700]   - Yes.
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.500]   - So you eating shit--
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500]   - Is on there forever.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.340]   - Forever.
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.300]   - The world can see it.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.820]   But it's one of the most important shows in comedy.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.260]   It's the most important show in comedy.
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:40.900]   Because first of all, it establishes standup
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:44.340]   in a sense that like for the open micers,
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.700]   for the people that are starting it out,
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.740]   it establishes that the most important thing is to be funny.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.780]   Like this is what the art form is all about.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.460]   And there's a lot of insecurity attached to that,
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.660]   and a lot of fears.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.820]   And so to alleviate some of those insecurities and fears,
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.820]   people will decide that the message is more important.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.220]   And they'll pretend that you have to have,
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:13.940]   you have to be socially aware
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.460]   that you have to promote things
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:20.300]   that are positive in your comedy, which is bullshit.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.780]   The people that say that, they're all bad.
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.100]   They're all bad at comedy.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.860]   And that's where the insecurity is.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.460]   It's like, they can't just kill.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.540]   So they have to pretend
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.540]   that they're supposed to be socially aware.
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.780]   And that being socially aware
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.860]   is an important part into society.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.260]   Like, let me explain something really clearly.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.260]   There's not a fucking person on earth
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.700]   who's ever changed their life because of a joke.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.100]   That's not what they're there for.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.260]   They're there for jokes.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.980]   The people that say that,
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.460]   they say that socially important comedy
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.660]   is the only comedy that's necessary.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.220]   The only comedy that you have to do.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.980]   That is just because they suck.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.300]   - Yeah. - That is it.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.460]   It's like the cop out is that
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.140]   they can't do the real comedy.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.300]   They can't crush.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.380]   It's not like someone goes from being,
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.780]   take like Shane Gillis,
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.780]   one of the best comics up and coming right now.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.340]   He's fucking fantastic.
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.980]   I can't recommend enough seeing that guy live.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.660]   I work with him in Irvine
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.740]   and I hadn't seen like his whole set.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.020]   I was crying.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.260]   I mean, he's so good.
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.500]   - I heard he's a racist.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.700]   So I haven't listened to any of his material, no.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.100]   - He's so good.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:26.420]   And his comedy is just all,
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.500]   just trying to be as funny as possible.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.460]   There's not a chance in hell
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.260]   that guy's just gonna go woke.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.660]   And he's just gonna start promoting
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:38.300]   some sort of socially conscious agenda
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.860]   that's facetious and just a bunch of nonsense
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:45.460]   that he's trying to elevate his own personal brand
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.940]   and virtue signal.
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.420]   That's not gonna happen.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.780]   The thing about "Kill Tony" is,
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.060]   in that, because you only have one minute
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.500]   and because it's live
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.180]   and because you don't want Tony shitting on you
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.300]   or everybody else shitting on,
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.700]   everybody's just gearing up
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.020]   to try to be as funny as possible.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:05.060]   And no one cares if you are gay or straight
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.700]   or Asian or black or trans or non-binary.
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.100]   Nobody gives a fuck.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.540]   Are you funny?
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.220]   If you're funny, you're in and everybody loves you.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:16.980]   You could be 80, you could be 20.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.460]   Nobody gives a shit.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.620]   You could be a woman or a man or ambiguous.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.260]   Nobody fucking cares.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.100]   Are you funny?
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.420]   And that's the most important thing
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.940]   for a community of comedy,
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.860]   to really promote comedy.
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.220]   Just funny, just be funny.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.340]   And so in that sense,
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.300]   "Kill Tony" is a real cornerstone of comedy.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.460]   - It's a reminder of what comedy's supposed to be about.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.140]   That said, even the funniest stuff
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:46.060]   has underneath it some wisdom that comes out of it.
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.980]   But that's not the primary goal of it.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.460]   - Yeah, I mean, it might be inspiring and fun.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.020]   Oh, Tim Dillon's a great example of that.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:55.340]   Yeah, he's got some amazing insights in his comedy,
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.540]   but it's still-
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.460]   - It's all about-
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:58.420]   - It's fucking comedy.
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:03:59.540]   - It's all about the funny.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.700]   - Yeah, it's all about the funny.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.620]   He's the best at doing that,
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.340]   especially in a podcast form,
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:09.140]   about weaving really important points in with hilarious,
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:14.140]   obviously, just jokes.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.300]   - Let me ask you, speaking of Tim Dillon,
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.900]   a chaotic, fucked up individual,
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.340]   can we go to your childhood real quick?
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.740]   A brief stroll.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.620]   So your mom and dad split up when you were five.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.180]   From a Jungian perspective,
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.460]   if you look at your subconscious,
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.100]   what impact do you think that had on you
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.500]   in forming who you are as a man, as a human being?
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.100]   - Well, at the time,
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.580]   I thought that my father was like a hero.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.140]   You know, he was my dad.
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.660]   I think every kid thinks like that about his dad.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.620]   His dad is like, your dad's your protector.
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.620]   Your dad is like the coolest guy in the world.
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.460]   That's what you like.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:56.300]   - You wanna be like him.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.300]   - Yeah, everybody wants to be like their dad,
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.380]   especially if your dad is like an imposing figure.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:04.220]   I remember one time me and my cousin got in a fight
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.060]   over nothing.
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:08.620]   It was like over who's tougher, King Kong or Godzilla.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.100]   - Yeah, over nothing.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.860]   That's an important, but yeah.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.780]   - He's like-
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.620]   - Actual fight, actual physical fight.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.020]   - Oh, I punched him in the face.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.100]   And-
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.220]   - This is when you were like five?
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:20.900]   And so-
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.100]   - Which side were you on?
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:22.940]   - King Kong.
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:23.780]   - Okay.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.620]   - I was wrong.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.500]   Godzilla's like way bigger.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:30.500]   Godzilla's 500 feet tall and he shoots fire out of his mouth.
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.340]   - Yeah.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.340]   Yeah, are you sure?
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:35.340]   I mean, there's an argument to be made.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.380]   It's not all about size, right?
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.980]   - No, there's no argument to be made.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.180]   500 feet tall versus 50 feet tall.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.940]   One's a gigantic dinosaur.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:46.540]   One is a stupid monkey who gets shot down by a plane.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.380]   You can't kill Godzilla.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.860]   - You don't think a monkey can ride Godzilla?
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.900]   Like kick him back?
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.740]   - No, no.
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.860]   You can't kill Godzilla with a plane.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.020]   (imitates plane engine)
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.260]   Like that shit wouldn't work in Godzilla.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.280]   Killed King Kong.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.220]   King Kong in the new movies kept growing.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.060]   - He's getting bigger and bigger.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.900]   - He got to the point where he's as big as Godzilla.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.620]   - It just feels like King Kong is stronger.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.460]   - Stop.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:12.620]   - Back take, back take.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.900]   Immediate back take.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.380]   You don't think there's a back take?
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.900]   There's a difference between human weapons
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.500]   and two animals going at it of a different size.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.620]   You don't think there's, in the jungle,
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:25.380]   a smaller animal could take on a bigger animal?
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.780]   Like a monkey versus a, let's see, a lion.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.380]   Monkey versus a bear.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.220]   - What?
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.060]   - Who wins?
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.900]   - A monkey versus a bear?
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.740]   - Not a monkey.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.620]   What's the strongest ape?
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:39.500]   No, but gorilla, okay.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.740]   Gorilla can't do back takes.
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.500]   I'm thinking of like a smaller, you know what I'm saying?
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.100]   'Cause in Jujitsu, you see this all the time.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.900]   - Do you remember that scene in "Talladega Nights"?
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:50.340]   Do you know "Talladega Nights"?
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.380]   Where the little boy's talking to his grandpa.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.460]   "I'll be all over you like a spider monkey."
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:56.540]   - Exactly, spider monkey.
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.220]   I was thinking, all right.
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.580]   - There's some animals, like here's a better example.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.660]   A wolverine.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:05.700]   Wolverines chase wolves and bears off of their kills.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.140]   And they're not very big at all.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.020]   They're just so ferocious.
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.500]   And they're so durable.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.460]   Like it's very hard to kill a wolverine.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.660]   - Yeah, and there's videos of like cats,
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.380]   like not actual cats, like domestic cats
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:22.380]   or domestic dogs starting shit with much larger animals.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.540]   And if they're ferocious enough, they're worse.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.420]   - Well, pit bulls are a great example of that.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.060]   Pit bulls are small, like real game bred pit bulls
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.260]   are like 35, 45 pounds.
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.340]   And they'll kill much larger dogs.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:36.420]   - Anyway, you were on King Kong's side.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.260]   - Yeah, so--
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.100]   - Get the shit out of your cousin.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.820]   - I remember he said to me,
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.660]   like I thought I was in like real trouble.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.660]   'Cause I remember my cousin's mom was yelling at me
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.540]   and it was like, you monster, all this crazy shit.
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:52.540]   So my dad got me alone and he said, tell me what happened.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:57.700]   And I told him, you know, we got in a fight.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.100]   We were arguing over King Kong, Godzilla.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.260]   And I punched him in the face.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.700]   And he goes, did you cry?
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.540]   I go, no.
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.020]   He goes, good, don't ever cry.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:12.540]   And I remember that like, whoa, okay.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.540]   And I remember thinking, all right,
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.060]   I'm just gonna start punching people.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.380]   (laughing)
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.660]   Because like, obviously my dad thinks it's a good idea
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.340]   if I go running around punching people
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.500]   as long as I don't cry.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:28.780]   I remember certain things about, you know.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:31.060]   And also like, this is again,
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.740]   like we were talking about watching Lenny Bruce
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:38.700]   and getting a timeline of what the world was like back then.
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.780]   This was a different world, you know.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:44.380]   In 1970, this would have been 1972.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.100]   It's a different world back then, man.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.900]   Like a really different world.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:53.140]   - Is some of that, so Carl Jung talked about the shadow.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.620]   It's the unconscious where you have dark stuff.
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.020]   And oftentimes you project the stuff
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.940]   that you're very self-critical about yourself,
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.220]   but because it's in your unconscious,
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.460]   you use it to project onto others.
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.460]   You see it as flaws in others.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.940]   And that's a good way to, like whatever,
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:15.540]   I think there's a quote, like everything that irritates us
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:18.700]   about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.820]   So that's a nice way to investigate yourself.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.340]   Like something that pisses you off.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.140]   You start asking questions of your own mind
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.820]   and that's how you bring it to the surface.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.780]   But anyway, from that, those are formative years.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.540]   - From that time, is there still stuff in your unconscious
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.540]   you think you haven't examined?
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.780]   Some dark shit?
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:40.420]   - I don't think so.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.820]   I don't, I'm not aware if it is, 'cause I've looked.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:50.260]   Like if someone says, I left something over your house.
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:51.420]   Like, where'd you leave it?
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.240]   I don't know.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.820]   Like, all right, I'll go look.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:55.900]   I'll get a real thorough looking.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.740]   - But I'm pretty sure.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.260]   - Pretty sure it's not there.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.660]   Yeah, I don't know, I think I've looked.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.700]   I mean, it certainly had an effect.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.620]   I think the positive effect also was compounded
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.980]   by the fact that when my mother married my stepdad,
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:13.460]   who's a great guy, who was a hippie, very different,
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.140]   we moved around a lot.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.780]   And so the bad thing about that was
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.900]   I didn't really develop long-term friends.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:22.060]   The good thing about that was that I was forced
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.700]   to develop my own opinions about things.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.500]   Instead of adopting an opinion of the neighborhood
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.980]   and the group about anything, I was forced
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.780]   to form my own thoughts and opinions
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.780]   about almost everything.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.500]   And so it made me much more of an independent thinker.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:44.500]   So that on top of the fact that losing my quote unquote hero
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:49.340]   very early on, and then having to form my own opinions
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:54.340]   about things, it left me with a very independent streak
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:11:00.220]   in terms of, and if I hadn't done the things
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.420]   that I got interested in, martial arts and then comedy,
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.140]   if I hadn't gotten interested in those things,
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:09.020]   I would have been fucked 'cause I was just too independent
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.060]   for normal jobs.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.820]   I was too independent for school.
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:15.260]   I just didn't wanna listen to people.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.660]   I was too feral.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:20.220]   I just didn't wanna sit still.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.260]   If I was with the wrong parents, especially today,
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.420]   I most certainly would have been medicated.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.900]   - Yeah, there's so many possible trajectories
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.020]   you can imagine where you would have not been
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.260]   the person you are today.
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:33.100]   - Oh yeah.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.260]   - This is probably one of the best possible.
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:39.300]   You're living, this particular storyline
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.540]   you're living through was one of the better ones.
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.980]   - This timeline is as good as it gets for someone like me.
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:45.860]   (laughing)
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.300]   - Is there advice you can give to people,
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:52.100]   to young kids that are living through a shitty situation
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.420]   of any sort, a tough life?
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.460]   - Find a thing you like.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:58.300]   Try to find a thing that you really enjoy.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.900]   Try to find a thing that you're passionate about.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.740]   - Like an activity.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.780]   - Yes, for me early on, it was drawing.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.100]   It was illustrations.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.300]   It was comic books.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.420]   I wanted to be a comic book illustrator.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.740]   And then it went from comic book drawing and illustrations
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:14.420]   to martial arts.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.660]   So, but it was just another thing
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:18.620]   that I was very, very passionate about.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:25.340]   And that was my vehicle out of my dilemma.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:29.500]   That was my vehicle out of my own anxiety and trauma
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:33.260]   and my own issues and insecurities.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:38.020]   And find something, find a thing that you genuinely enjoy
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:42.420]   because getting good at things you genuinely enjoy
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.880]   is extremely beneficial for young people
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.300]   because it lets you know that,
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.580]   like everybody thinks they're a loser.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.180]   Every young person thinks they're a loser.
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.860]   At least a young person in the situation I was at.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.860]   Like I didn't know I wasn't a loser
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.420]   until I started winning,
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.100]   till I started doing martial arts.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.660]   Martial arts taught me that like I could get better at stuff
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.660]   that it wasn't, I wasn't really a loser.
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.940]   I just was someone who was like in a fucked up situation
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.940]   but you could channel all that energy
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.580]   that you have as a young person into something
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.580]   and get better at it.
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.700]   And then all of a sudden people admired me.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.660]   I was like, this is crazy.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:23.660]   So I went from being someone who was incredibly insecure
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:27.860]   and basically a failure to someone who was really successful
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.120]   at this one thing that was very dangerous
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.940]   that other people were scared of.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:35.020]   And that gave me immense confidence
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:39.500]   and also a real understanding of the direct correlation
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.940]   between hard work and success.
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:44.620]   - And a kind of understanding that you're not a loser.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.460]   - Right.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.940]   - That there is some diamond in the rough.
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.060]   - Yeah, and also an understanding
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.380]   that you can't listen to people.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.060]   'Cause even my parents didn't want me to do martial arts.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.340]   They didn't want me to fight.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:55.860]   They didn't want me to do standup.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:14:00.140]   There's like, you have to understand like who you are
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:05.140]   and then in the face of other people's either criticism
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:10.420]   or lack of faith in your ability to succeed,
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:15.100]   you push through and there's great benefit in that.
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:17.580]   And then you realize that you can kind of apply that
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.940]   to other things in life.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.340]   You can apply that to critics.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:23.180]   You can apply that to social media commentators.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.580]   You can apply that to a lot of things.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:30.500]   - Okay, what about young people in their fifties?
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.460]   Can you give advice to, like, imagine you're sitting back,
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.140]   probably still here in Texas in your nineties,
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:41.380]   looking back, what advice would that guy give to you today?
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:46.380]   Or like people that have done some shit in their fifties,
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:50.780]   you've gone through a hell of a life.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:54.740]   There's potentially some incentive to settle down.
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.160]   You got a great family to relax,
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.500]   but maybe there's some incentive to still do epic shit.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:04.100]   Still be David Goggins running in the middle of the desert
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.660]   screaming shit into a camera.
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:09.180]   - If you're David Goggins, you have to be David Goggins.
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.900]   I don't think there's a path for that guy
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:15.180]   that exists at this stage of his life other than that.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:17.460]   - Do you think he'll be 70 and still screaming?
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.900]   - Yes.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.860]   A hundred percent.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.700]   A hundred percent.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:26.540]   If David and I are alive, we're both 70,
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.940]   he's going to call me up and say,
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.100]   "Stay hard, motherfucker!"
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.300]   Guaranteed.
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.320]   Guaranteed.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.060]   - So lean into whatever the fuck you are at this point.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.620]   - Well, if you're enjoying it,
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.160]   but if you're not enjoying it, rethink your life.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.580]   Try to figure out why you're not enjoying it.
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.040]   - You still think it's possible
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.700]   to shift things in your 50s?
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:45.520]   - Yeah.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.700]   If you're alive, you can get better.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:48.680]   - No matter what.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.520]   - Yeah, no matter what.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.660]   If you're alive, you can shift things.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.940]   I mean, if you're 90 years old
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:54.780]   and you have a month to live,
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.420]   you can apologize for the things you think you did wrong
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:01.940]   and maybe sort of reconcile and shape relationships
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.820]   that you have with the people that are around you better
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:07.180]   so that they feel differently about you after you're gone.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.500]   - Yeah, I always loved people in their 70s
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.460]   who are getting back into dating or something like that.
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:13.460]   - Yeah!
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.740]   I was watching a video about a woman who's in her 60s
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.600]   who just started powerlifting.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.440]   - Nice.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.280]   - Yeah.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.100]   - And same with jiu-jitsu.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.380]   You see people get into jiu-jitsu.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:22.220]   - Mm-hmm, yeah.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.940]   - Like a white belt that's like 70.
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.100]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.540]   There's a lot of, if you're alive,
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.420]   you can get better at stuff.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.700]   And I don't think people are happy
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:40.220]   if they don't have puzzles and complex tasks
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.980]   and things that are interesting to them,
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:43.620]   whether it's an art project
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.060]   or whether it's learning something completely new
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.380]   like stand-up comedy.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:49.900]   Like doing things that are difficult,
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:55.540]   it's as much of a nourishment of the mind
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:58.980]   as food is a nourishment of the body.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:03.900]   I think you need things that are puzzling to you
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:08.780]   where you have to find your own human potential
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:11.180]   in the difficulty of the task
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:15.100]   and work your way through things, at least for me.
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.020]   For me, I mean, I can only speak for me
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.260]   'cause I'm the only life that I've ever lived
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.260]   that I'm aware of.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:25.260]   And in my life, that has been 100% constant.
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:28.300]   I am a very happy person
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.540]   and I have never had a moment
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.700]   where I'm not doing difficult shit ever.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:37.100]   - What matters most is how well you walk through the fires.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.620]   You just keep starting fires for yourself to walk through.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.820]   - Well, they don't necessarily have to be fires, right?
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:45.620]   Because fires are like kind of out of control.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.740]   - Lukewarm. - Tasks.
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.100]   - The surfaces. - Tasks.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:53.300]   Give yourself something, an arduous, difficult task
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.140]   where you're challenged,
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.700]   challenged mentally and challenged physically.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.820]   One of the great things about being challenged physically
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.340]   is it's also mental.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.980]   The people that don't understand that
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.940]   have never really been challenged physically.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.660]   People that think that physical challenges
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.020]   are just like, just physical,
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.620]   it's just brute grunt work, it's not.
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.340]   It's emotional intelligence.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:19.060]   It's understanding your desire to quit
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.620]   and conquering your inner bitch.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.300]   All that stuff is, it's mental.
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.380]   It's playing out inside your head.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.540]   And there's a mental strength that you acquire from that
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.580]   that you can apply to intellectual pursuits.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:36.020]   And the people that don't think that
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:38.900]   are the people that haven't attempted them.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.460]   And there's an arrogance to people
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:45.780]   that only pursue intellectual exercises,
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.660]   only pursue intellectual things,
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.500]   and don't pursue anything physical.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.780]   That the physical stuff is base, it's grunt work,
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:54.180]   it's primal, it's not necessary.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.300]   I don't think that's accurate.
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.500]   I don't think that they're,
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.580]   I mean, obviously there's people like Stephen Hawking
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:03.940]   who have no opportunity to do anything physical, right?
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:05.620]   His physical dilemma is keeping us,
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.140]   or was keeping his heart beating.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:09.820]   But for most people,
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.380]   I think you can really benefit from physical struggle
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:16.540]   and you benefit from it in a mental way.
[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:18.900]   And I think that is overlooked.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:21.700]   That's unfortunately overlooked by academics
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:24.420]   and intellectuals who,
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:27.980]   they make excuses for why they're fat and lazy or scrawny.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.060]   - Well, they don't need to be,
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.860]   it's not even about the fat or all of that.
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:34.180]   It's like literally,
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:36.460]   there's something about the physical challenge
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.300]   that's really good for you,
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.580]   especially if you're academic,
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.140]   especially if you do intellectual types though.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.860]   There's this great roboticist at MIT, Russ Tedrick.
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:47.420]   He runs barefoot to and from MIT every day.
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:49.060]   - I love it.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.540]   - Like seven to 10 miles each way.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.380]   - Barefoot?
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.220]   - Barefoot.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.220]   Well, he studies legged locomotion, legged robots.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:57.940]   So for him, it's also interesting
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:00.460]   how the human body moves.
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.780]   He sees the beauty in all movement.
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.620]   - What do his feet look like?
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.820]   - You know, calloused.
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:06.940]   - Destroyed, right?
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.300]   - No, just calloused.
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.140]   They're nice.
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.940]   They form a nice,
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.220]   it's not like I gave him a foot massage,
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:15.740]   but I mean, they look,
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:16.980]   and I don't have a foot fetish,
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:21.300]   so I'm not able to correctly evaluate
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.380]   another man's feet.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.540]   I apologize for this,
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:25.700]   but they don't look fucked up.
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.780]   - Does he run on concrete?
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.020]   - Yeah, he runs all surfaces.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:32.860]   - And he does everything completely barefoot?
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.940]   - The running part at work.
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:37.860]   So one of the things he has to do is fit into society,
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.300]   which means he has to change clothes and appear normal.
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.140]   - Right.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.780]   So does he wear like zero shoes?
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.260]   You know, those barefoot type shoes?
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:50.300]   - No, because that's like very hippie, wokey type of thing.
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.460]   No, like he's barefoot when he's running,
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.180]   and then he wears like normal looking stuff,
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.020]   like dress shoes.
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.300]   - How did he work his way up to running barefoot?
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.940]   - So he was significantly overweight.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:07.660]   And his advisor, this other famous person at MIT
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.620]   who was a roboticist, took his own life.
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:13.100]   And that made him,
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:16.380]   that made Russ face his own mortality, I think.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.940]   I mean, you start to ask big questions
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.460]   about your wellbeing, like,
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.700]   holy shit, this ride can end at any moment.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.780]   And so he started taking his
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.220]   sort of physical wellbeing seriously.
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:31.800]   But as a result of that, not that he become like shredded,
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.300]   but he's also discovered the intellectual value,
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:41.540]   the humbling value of physical exercise.
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:42.940]   So he's not preachy about it at all.
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:45.300]   I don't think, I actually rarely hear him
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.460]   advise it to anyone.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:49.340]   He just does it as a,
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.300]   almost like meditation or something like that.
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.460]   - It's definitely a form of meditation,
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.620]   and you can attest to that, right?
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.300]   You do quite a bit of running.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.380]   There's a thing about a (exhaling)
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:03.380]   it kind of, almost like a mantra gets formed,
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:04.620]   and you get into it.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.220]   - You know what's great here in the Austin heat,
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:09.220]   100 degree weather, that tests you.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.780]   - You know what I love to do outside?
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.260]   Pull sleds.
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.780]   That's my thing.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.620]   I love to pull sleds outside.
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.460]   - In the heat.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.940]   - Yeah, I did today.
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:18.780]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.900]   - Yeah, I love it.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.180]   - So you're also, your wife is incredible.
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.940]   You're in a relationship.
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.060]   You're married, you have a great family.
[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:29.460]   What advice would you give to me and to others like me
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.620]   who are dumb fucks and have not found a relationship?
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.060]   - Well, you're a great guy,
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.340]   so this definitely doesn't necessarily apply to you,
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:40.220]   but be someone who someone would wanna be
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:41.780]   in a relationship with.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:44.340]   There's a lot of people out there that want a great partner.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:46.180]   They want someone in a relationship,
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:49.620]   but why would someone wanna be in a relationship with you?
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.700]   Maybe you bicker a lot, maybe you're jealous,
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.700]   maybe you lie, maybe you're cruel,
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:02.760]   maybe you don't have a sense of humor,
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.100]   maybe you're not kind.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:10.100]   Like, what is it about you that people would not enjoy
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.380]   being around or that people avoid?
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.580]   Fix that.
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.820]   - Well, this applies to me as well.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.260]   Like you said something with Cam Haines.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:21.060]   One of the things you admire is the discipline it takes
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:24.380]   to sort of juggle so many things and do it successfully.
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.460]   I'm not sure I'm very good at that.
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.260]   - So juggling all this hard work
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:29.700]   and then also a relationship.
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.220]   - Also a relationship, also family,
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:32.700]   all those kinds of priorities.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:35.300]   I mean, that requires having your shit together.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.120]   - It does, it's a different thing.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.300]   But it's also, you gotta find the right person.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:43.100]   There's a lot of people who settle for sexy.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.140]   They settle for hot.
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:44.980]   - Oh, for, okay, yeah.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.100]   - They settle for the wrong person.
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:48.500]   Like, you can get hot and nice.
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:49.900]   They're out there.
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.940]   But don't get hot and mean.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.300]   Hot and mean's not fun.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.540]   Then you get Amber Heard.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.620]   - Yeah, and then you end up in a trial.
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.660]   You can be deceived by perfect symmetry.
[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:03.060]   - So you don't think it's a good idea
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.700]   to record your partner?
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.100]   - I think you should record all conversations.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.220]   The CIA's doing it no matter what.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.620]   I assume that every conversation I have is recorded,
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.120]   'cause I'm pretty sure it is.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.100]   (laughing)
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.740]   - Even when we had dinner with Alex Jones,
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.580]   he was recording.
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:17.420]   - Yeah.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.240]   - I still remember that.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.340]   (laughing)
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:21.260]   - Oh, I didn't know that was recording.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:23.260]   - He might, you know what would be funny?
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.900]   If he is the CIA plan.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.940]   - He could be, could be.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:27.780]   - That'd be the ultimate joke.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:30.100]   - But that's my advice about relationships,
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:31.880]   is be somebody.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.880]   And then also, find someone who you can grow with.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:39.940]   You don't wanna be with someone
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.580]   that doesn't share your value.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:46.020]   You don't wanna be with someone who makes excuses.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.180]   You don't wanna be with someone who's lazy,
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.900]   or who's spiteful.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:53.320]   You wanna be with someone who's genuinely kind.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.500]   That's one of the things that I really love about my wife,
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.900]   and she's very smart, and she works hard.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:01.060]   She's a dedicated, disciplined person.
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.600]   But she's also really nice.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.880]   That's one of the things I like the most about her.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.020]   She's so nice.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:07.280]   She's always smiling.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.940]   - And that energy is great.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.540]   - Yeah, I mean, you've seen us together.
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.540]   You've hung around with us.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:14.740]   She's fun.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.000]   - Yeah, she's great. - She's a lot of fun.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.780]   - Yeah, she makes you just feel great to be alive.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.140]   It's good to have people like that around you.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.260]   - She's happy.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.420]   She's a happy person.
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:23.660]   She's happy to be around.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.540]   That's the kind of people that you could have in your life
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.640]   as friends, and as coworkers, and as lovers,
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.720]   and wives, and husbands.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.140]   You can find those people.
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:32.980]   They're real.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.500]   And when you find those people, your life is better.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.140]   Like, to have a good tribe is very important.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.220]   To have a good tribe of people, you know?
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.380]   And I think if there's anything
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.420]   that I'm very, very fortunate about,
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:46.980]   it's the people that I'm around.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.960]   I have very good friends, and one of which is you.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.100]   It's so valuable to have quality people around you
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:58.060]   because it makes you want to do better
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:01.460]   because you admire the hard work that these people put in,
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:05.260]   like my Kam Haines, or Goggins, or many of my friends.
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:09.700]   And people that are generous, and people that are curious,
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:13.980]   and people that are honest, they inspire you to do the same.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:16.100]   And it's extremely valuable.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.700]   It's one of the most valuable things
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:22.980]   is to surround yourself with positive, healthy,
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.700]   friendly, generous people.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.020]   - That's why I cut out Tim Dillon for my life.
[01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:28.860]   I broke up with him.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:29.860]   - I thought you guys were getting married.
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.180]   - No, it's over.
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.220]   It's none of those things.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:36.280]   The Texas nonstop, the nonstop conspiracy theories,
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.860]   the nonstop mocking of my Eastern European origins.
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:45.580]   It's just not healthy for me.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:49.380]   Plus, he's physically abusive and a towering figure.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:50.940]   Both emotionally. - He's a big boy.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.500]   - Physically.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.460]   No, no, I love him.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.300]   Okay. - If he worked out,
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.380]   he would be a house.
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:59.260]   He's got such a large frame, you know?
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:01.940]   - So if I interview Putin,
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.340]   what should I ask him?
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:04.900]   - How's the cancer?
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.060]   How's it doing, buddy?
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.700]   (laughing)
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.100]   That's question number one in Russian.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.180]   Do you think he has cancer?
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:13.620]   - I don't think so.
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.980]   - The narrative is terrifying, right?
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:19.020]   Dictator of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:22.780]   who also has cancer and just invaded a sovereign country.
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.140]   That's a terrifying narrative.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.180]   'Cause that's what we're all afraid of.
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:26.740]   Someone who has nothing to lose,
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:29.780]   who just decides to let loose a nuke.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:32.140]   - Well, I do think, maybe it's projecting,
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.660]   but if I had cancer,
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:36.660]   or if you think about leaders that have cancer,
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:38.700]   you're facing your own mortality,
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:42.340]   I would think he would be more focused on his legacy.
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:46.340]   And dropping a nuclear bomb is not good for legacy.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:49.380]   I do believe he wants to be remembered as a great leader,
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:52.620]   as a lot of leaders do, as a lot of even dictators do.
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:55.500]   And I think he wants to figure out a way
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:01.860]   to pull out a win so he can say that
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:05.420]   whatever this thing was, whatever this invasion was,
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:08.260]   was good for Russia, was good for the nation.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:11.540]   He ultimately made it a greater nation than it was before.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:13.500]   And perhaps he could justify
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.380]   an escalation of war to be that.
[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:19.900]   But I don't, and it's just the cancer thing
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:23.620]   concerns me so much because it's been so often
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:26.420]   part of this propaganda that's been told about Putin,
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.260]   he's sick, I don't know why.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.860]   It's always, people kind of wonder that a lot about,
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.380]   especially dictators, but you had that even like
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.660]   with Hillary Clinton and obviously with Biden,
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:39.940]   that narrative is stickier.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:40.780]   So for some people it's stickier.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.180]   - Well, that narrative is transparent and obvious.
[01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:46.260]   - But the degree of it is a question with Biden,
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:48.500]   as it is with everyone.
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.780]   Like what's, you know, how healthy is this leader?
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.380]   That's a question people often ask.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:55.460]   - Always, they were doing that about Trump too.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:59.340]   The thing about Putin though is like his appearance
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:02.660]   is altered where he looks very bloated.
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:04.420]   His body doesn't look much bigger,
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:07.380]   but his face looks like puffy and swollen.
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:10.660]   I had a friend who had sarcoidosis
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:14.580]   and they prescribed prednisone,
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:16.220]   which is a type of a steroid.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:18.260]   And one of the things that would happen when he was on it
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:21.820]   is his face would get really big.
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:25.780]   It was like, he would blow up, like a swell up
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:29.860]   and maintain a lot of water and inflammation.
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:32.900]   And that's what it looks like when I'm looking at Putin.
[01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.740]   - So actually like if you're sitting with him,
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.900]   one question is about health.
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:41.020]   That's, has Biden been asked that kind of question?
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:42.700]   No, like without mockery, without any of that.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.220]   - He would have to go on Fox News.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:46.740]   Like the mainstream media treats him with kid gloves
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:49.340]   in a way that I've never seen.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:53.620]   I mean, it's so obvious there's something horribly wrong
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:55.660]   with his cognitive function.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:59.340]   - Well, to push back, I don't know if it's horribly wrong.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.420]   - You don't think it's horribly wrong?
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.340]   - I think it's, no, I think there's uncertainty
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.980]   to which degree it's wrong.
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:08.100]   I would love to there to be a serious like conversation
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:09.700]   about it with him.
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:11.820]   In fact, I actually have to now look,
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.460]   'cause of course Fox News will mock
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:19.060]   his like declining mental health.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.700]   And then I would love like sort of an objective discussion.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.020]   Are you aware of this?
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:27.140]   Are you, like, what are you putting in place?
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.980]   Are you yourself, 'cause if I was a person
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:32.660]   with declining mental abilities,
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:36.540]   like you have to start, you have to start thinking
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:37.360]   about that kind of stuff.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.820]   Like who is around you?
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:40.380]   Who are the advisors?
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.500]   What if you start, stop being able to see the world clearly?
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.340]   - Yeah.
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:46.460]   - I would be transparent about that kind of stuff.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.260]   - Well, you would be, but you're also,
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:49.580]   you would never be a politician.
[01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:50.420]   - Yeah.
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:51.940]   - 'Cause you're too fucking honest.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:55.020]   - Well, yeah, but actually from a conversation perspective,
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:57.140]   it would be nice if that kind of discussion was had.
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:00.060]   - It would be, but all jokes aside, with Putin,
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:06.780]   I would ask questions about democracy versus what they have.
[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:13.500]   I mean, without any disparaging descriptions
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:16.820]   of what is going on over in Russia.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.540]   It's clearly not a democracy.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:26.360]   I mean, the way he has it set up, the elections are a joke.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.900]   - So he would push back, that's not clearly not a democracy.
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.060]   He is still very popular.
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.460]   So majority of people are huge supporters
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:34.680]   of Putin inside Russia.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.420]   The people that push back against that would say
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.740]   that that's because any serious opposition
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.100]   is pushed out of the country.
[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:43.940]   - Yeah.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.620]   - So I guess competition. - Arrested and murdered.
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:46.460]   - Yeah.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.020]   - But yes, that's a really, really good question.
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.820]   - The value of dictatorships.
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:53.260]   One of the things about the United States
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:57.740]   that's fascinating to me is that every four years,
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:00.700]   unless it's four to eight years, right?
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.560]   Someone does two terms, but every four years,
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:06.300]   there's an opportunity for someone to be new
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:07.900]   and completely inexperienced
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:09.860]   at the most difficult job in the world,
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:12.220]   which is ridiculous.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.020]   - So the interesting thing is,
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:17.780]   it actually makes sense after eight years,
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:19.380]   you've gained the wisdom.
[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:22.180]   You would actually be a pretty good leader to keep going.
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.780]   But there is some problem where the power
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:26.620]   starts getting to your head.
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.180]   And so from Putin's perspective,
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:32.020]   I think he genuinely wants the best for Russia.
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.740]   I don't think he's lost his mind
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:37.300]   in terms of it's all about greed and so on.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.180]   Same as Stalin.
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:40.860]   I think Stalin, until the end of his days,
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:43.300]   wanted the best for the Soviet Union.
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:44.620]   So it's not like you become,
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:47.140]   Hitler, I think, lost his mind during the war,
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:50.020]   like where it was like he wasn't seen clearly at all.
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:54.020]   What Putin believes is that he is actually the best person
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:57.360]   to bring out the best for his country.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:02.060]   Now, the problem is maybe refreshing the leader
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.340]   is in fact in the long term, the best thing,
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:06.260]   versus every leader believes they know
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.700]   what's best for the country.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:09.740]   The point is to keep refreshing it.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:10.580]   - Well--
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:11.940]   - And that's the case for democracy.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:14.100]   That's the case for the system we have
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:19.100]   that creates natural, maybe emergent balance of power.
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:21.060]   - I think it makes it evident
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:24.340]   that there is no clear cut, real right way to do it.
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.980]   And that if you had the perfect person in,
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:30.660]   having them for 12, 20 years would be amazing.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:34.060]   If you had a perfect, benevolent leader
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:36.140]   who clearly only cared about the people,
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:38.580]   was doing their best and striving hard
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:40.900]   and got great satisfaction knowing
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.980]   that he is a dedicated civil servant
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:46.940]   that only wants to lead the country
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:49.540]   in a way that's gonna benefit the most people
[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.220]   in the most profound way.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:56.300]   But we have a dirty political system
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.180]   that's completely corrupted by money,
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.120]   completely corrupted by influence.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:05.100]   The fact that the lobbyists,
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.860]   I mean, there's an area outside of Washington, DC,
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.700]   it's one of the richest areas in the country
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.420]   and it's where the lobbyists live.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:14.180]   There's so much money involved in being a lobbyist.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:17.880]   There's so much money involved in special interest groups
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   and how much of an impact they have on who gets elected
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.080]   and what decisions get made once that person gets elected.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.340]   We know this, right?
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.560]   We know it's not for the people by the people.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.920]   It's just not what it is.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:33.680]   I mean, this country is an experiment in self-government.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.940]   And if we could do it all over again,
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:39.180]   I would say the most important thing
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:42.900]   is to have laws in place to keep money out of politics
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.020]   and to make it a heinous crime
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:50.520]   for someone to influence laws and policy
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:56.260]   based entirely on the amount of profit
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:01.260]   it could generate for a party or for a company
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:04.500]   that is investing in a candidate.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.460]   That's fucking incredibly dangerous and it's corrupt.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.340]   And that corruption has been accepted.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:12.640]   We've just accepted that this corruption exists.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.140]   - Last question.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:18.460]   If Putin asks to see this watch, what do I tell him?
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:20.100]   Would you give it?
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.740]   Should I let him see it?
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:23.980]   'Cause we know what happens with a Super Bowl ring.
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:26.700]   - I think a Super Bowl ring is unique.
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:29.500]   He could buy a watch like that pretty easy.
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:33.260]   - But this particular, isn't that a power move?
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.620]   - Yeah, but I'm-- - So this is the watch
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:35.460]   you gave me. - Yeah, yes.
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.420]   - There's a story. - Yes.
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.940]   - I would probably share it with him, the story.
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:43.060]   - And then maybe he'd go, "Can I see this watch?"
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.620]   - Yeah. - And then he puts it on.
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:45.460]   - Say no. - Thank you.
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:46.300]   - Do you say no?
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:49.220]   - You go like this, "Yeah, there it is, bro."
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:50.140]   (laughing)
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:51.300]   - Bro. - You know, take it off.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.180]   - So many words I'm gonna have to find translations.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.780]   Buddy, bro. (laughing)
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.660]   I guess bros, brother.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.820]   - I mean, if he takes your watch, I'll buy you another one.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.580]   If Putin steals it. (laughing)
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.100]   - Keep him going.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:05.140]   - I'll just give you the same exact watch.
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:06.620]   - Well, first of all, thank you for this.
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.940]   - My pleasure, bro. - And I really wanted
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:11.900]   to talk to you 'cause in a couple of days,
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:14.580]   I'm leaving to Ukraine and Russia,
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:18.900]   and I hope I'll be back in one piece
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:21.420]   and drink whiskey with you once again.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:22.460]   - Yeah, I hope so too.
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.700]   I'm nervous about you going over there.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.700]   I know journalists have been killed now.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:29.900]   - But they don't know jujitsu.
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:33.540]   No, I think you'll be okay,
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.500]   and I think there's certain things you do in life
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.500]   that just kind of your heart pulls towards that so much.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.700]   - What's your objective over there?
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:43.740]   - I'm not somebody who thinks about objectives clearly.
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:47.380]   It's just something about me says I need to go there.
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:52.380]   But to put in loose words is to try to understand
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:56.420]   what that world is now.
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:00.300]   So I remember what it was years ago when I was there.
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.100]   I know my family.
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.820]   I know the generations of family that was there
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:07.620]   on that land in Ukraine and in Russia,
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:12.060]   and the soul of the people, the love that's there,
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.700]   the beauty of the culture,
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.660]   and I wanna see what it is today
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:18.060]   and what this war has created,
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.340]   both the anger and the love in the people,
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:22.340]   and just hear them out and just talk to them.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:24.060]   No recordings, none of that.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:26.820]   Maybe a little here and there, but mostly just for me.
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:31.700]   I don't know, sometimes it's just something pulls you
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:35.860]   to a place, and I also,
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:39.180]   because I'm able to speak Russian and some Ukrainian,
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.100]   I do want to try to have these,
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:45.420]   a couple of the political leaders involved, talk to them.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:46.860]   And I have all the right connections.
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.220]   Everybody has said yes.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:51.620]   Of course, you don't know the likelihood it finally happens,
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.540]   but I wanna at least have that possibility there.
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:57.340]   Sometimes you have to go to a place to really understand it.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.380]   You can't just read about it.
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.540]   You can't just talk to the people that are living there.
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.340]   You have to be there.
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:05.060]   And I've never been in a war zone.
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:09.820]   I've never been in a land that's been damaged
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:15.460]   and wiped by the weapons of war,
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:17.260]   and I just want to feel that,
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:19.300]   because so much of that land is,
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:23.420]   I remember when everything was flourishing.
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:26.120]   Yes, corruption, all those kinds of things,
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:29.540]   but people were there, and the culture was flourishing,
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:30.380]   and people were happy.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.380]   There was lots of struggle, but they were happy.
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:34.780]   And now people are extremely angry.
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:36.660]   There's hate in the air on all sides.
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.620]   I wanna see that.
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.460]   I wanna understand.
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:41.980]   Sometimes it just pulls you, and you have to go.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:44.700]   So it doesn't make any sense, perhaps,
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:45.820]   but you just gotta do it.
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.620]   - What's the timeline?
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.620]   - Of when I'm going?
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:49.780]   - How long?
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:51.220]   - No, one way.
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:52.900]   I don't have a plan. - Really?
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:53.860]   Wow.
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:57.700]   - Yeah, so I'm hoping back in a month.
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:02.920]   But also, just to clarify,
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.080]   I'm not somebody who seeks risk.
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:09.840]   You're somebody who seems to be terrified
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:12.000]   of bears and sharks, so you don't.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.720]   (laughs)
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.520]   So why go surfing?
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.960]   Why go swimming in the ocean?
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.160]   So I'm somebody that's the same, probably with sharks too.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.680]   I'm not taking unnecessary risk,
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.920]   but certain things that just mean a lot to you,
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:26.000]   you take the risk.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.400]   And so a little bit of risk,
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:33.360]   willing to take to discover something about myself,
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.800]   honestly, is probably what it all boils down to,
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.880]   try to understand myself,
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.240]   'cause so much of me is from that place.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.880]   Well, this is the beautiful thing about America,
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:47.440]   is it's like stitches together all these different cultures.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.480]   Everybody came from somewhere else.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.280]   And you try to understand,
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:54.240]   in order for me to be a good American,
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.000]   I need to understand who I was, where I came from.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000]   And that's, nothing reveals the spirit of a people
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.680]   better than war.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.000]   It's like there's something about this conflict
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.680]   that really cuts all the bullshit.
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.960]   This is who we are.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.760]   This is who we are as a people.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.320]   So I wanna see it, I wanna understand.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.320]   And like I said, wanna come back,
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:23.760]   drink some whiskey with you.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.080]   - All right, well, I hope that happens.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:26.920]   I really do.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.360]   And I hope you're safe over there.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.600]   And I hope you come back with whatever insight
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.120]   you're trying to achieve.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.280]   - Thank you for doing this conversation.
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.120]   - My pleasure, brother.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.840]   - Thank you for everything you've done for me,
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:41.080]   for the support, for the love, and everybody around you.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.120]   Thank you for everything you're doing,
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:46.100]   for everybody around you, for giving back,
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:48.480]   but for just giving and being kind to everybody.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.320]   I love you, brother.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.480]   - I love you too, thank you.
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.960]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Rogan.
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.120]   To support this podcast,
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.720]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.440]   And now let me leave you with one of Joe's
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:04.240]   and one of my favorite quotes from Miyamoto Musashi.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.360]   "Once you know the way broadly,
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.300]   "you will see it in everything."
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:12.320]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:17.480]   (upbeat music)
