[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   This week on the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.600]   we are joined by guest Dr. Richard Lentz,
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.240]   who serves as the Vice President for Academic Affairs
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.720]   and Dean of the main campus of Gordon-Conwell
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.680]   Theological Seminary just north of Boston.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.400]   Dr. Lentz is also the author of a fascinating book
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.080]   that releases this winter titled,
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.080]   Identity and Idolatry, The Image of God and Its Inversion.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.200]   It's published in Don Carson series,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.240]   New Studies in Biblical Theology.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.560]   And it's, in my opinion,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.480]   one of the better ones in the series.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.440]   And Dr. Lentz, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.640]   Of course, you know, biblically,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.200]   we become like what we worship.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.220]   We become like what we behold.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.760]   That's a biblical paradigm in scripture.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.680]   We see in Psalm 115, verses four to eight,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.640]   in Romans chapter one, verses 18 to 27.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.520]   We see it in Romans chapter 12, verses one and two,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.080]   and we see it in Colossians 3.10 and 2 Corinthians 3.18.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.440]   It's really all over the place.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.600]   We become like what we behold.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.680]   Negatively, of course, this is called idolatry.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.440]   So to start out our week,
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.080]   can you summarize the Bible's explanation of idolatry
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.680]   and how idols shape us and change us
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160]   to the very core of our identity?
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.080]   - Yeah, it's a great question to start with
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.320]   because our attention, especially of late,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.240]   has been to think about the way in which
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.040]   that dynamic of our identity is formed negatively.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.000]   That is the way in which our desires are drawn
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.440]   to certain objects, which in turn shape us.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.560]   That's the core dynamic of idolatry,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.720]   but it's also the core dynamic of worship.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   It's the same experience, but flipped upside down.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.560]   And of course, the scriptures start not with what's wrong,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.680]   but with what we are created for.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.760]   So worship is also the experience of becoming
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.280]   like what we behold, like what we desire,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.240]   in the positive sense of that word,
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.480]   created, if you will, to reflect God, to behold God.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   So idolatry is kind of turning that dynamic upside down,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.960]   but it's still a pretty natural dynamic in all of us.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.600]   We still find our identity outside of ourselves.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.280]   We don't find out who we are by looking inside.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   Idolatry is the honoring of things as ultimate,
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.360]   which are not ultimate, and which therefore reshape us
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.120]   after their own image.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.200]   And the key question for us as we wrestle
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.160]   with our own idolatries are simply the questions
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   about where does our hope lie?
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.400]   What do we think gives us significance?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.880]   What do we really at heart desire to become?
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.600]   And so though it's a incredibly personal matter
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.160]   that is of the human heart to wrestle with,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   it's also very much a communal question
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.720]   because it lies outside of ourselves.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   It is not simply an individual decision.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.600]   And therein lies the complexity of idolatry.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.480]   Idolatry in any age, and we're gonna talk a lot
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.640]   about our modern idolatries in this conversation,
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.200]   but we need to be reminded that idolatry is not peculiar
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.920]   to our age, but it's present in every age.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.600]   It just happens that we have different kinds of idols today
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.800]   than we had in earlier times.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.640]   - Yeah, so fill that out for us a little bit more.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.960]   For good or for bad, we never find our identity
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.880]   by ourselves, in ourselves.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.920]   Explain that.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.000]   - Yeah, I think the way in which we have been created,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.960]   and it really has to do with this fundamental
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.560]   biblical conviction that we are reflectors,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.640]   we are images, we are mirrors, if you will.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.480]   And so that whole metaphor of the human being,
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.480]   that which reflects its environment, reflects its context,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.520]   reflects its idols, reflects its God,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.200]   is absolutely core from the beginning
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.760]   to the end of the canon.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.360]   And so in the beginning, ordinarily,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   what we call worship, worshiping God faithfully, truly,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.440]   is also a matter of our identity.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.240]   That's what we're created for.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.080]   That's who we are.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.960]   And so it's not a matter of discovering
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.840]   that critical dynamic of identity.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.600]   It's a matter of coming to grips with it,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   realizing that our identity is part of that,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.240]   I don't wanna call it an equation,
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.080]   but part of the dynamic between ourselves
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.240]   and the world outside of us.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.640]   And so lots of implications on that.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.960]   It's no accident that we are not created
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.600]   as simply individuals, but we're always individuals
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.720]   in a relationship.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.280]   Relationships remind us that identity lies outside of us
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.880]   in this community.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.840]   And of course, the fundamental relationship is with God,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.280]   but there are obviously lots of other relationships
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.320]   that take place.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.240]   And I think the mythology of the early part
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.080]   of the 20th century, and it still resonates
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.520]   to some extent in our time,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   is that the individual in isolation is who they really are.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.280]   And we've recognized that that really is a myth
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   that we find ourselves in community.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.960]   That is, we find ourselves in the reflections
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.280]   of the context that we are in,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.120]   rather than simply in the privacy of our own,
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.360]   you know, our own internal introspective thoughts.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.000]   As the adage goes, we are not who we think we are.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.160]   We are not who other people think we are.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.760]   We are often who we think other people think we are.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.280]   There is that dynamic of recognizing ourselves
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.800]   when we recognize others.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.720]   And of course, the core character in the plot,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.920]   if you will, in this novel of ours,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.840]   in this great story, is God.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.200]   God is personal, God is relational.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.120]   God, we find ourselves in relationship, ultimately,
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.480]   to him, and that's the missing dynamic
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.680]   in our own contemporary experience
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.240]   of being defined by our context.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.360]   We forget that the mega-context,
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.920]   the actual context of our lives, is God.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.360]   - Yes, I wanna return to this point later.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.040]   In your book, "Identity and Idolatry,"
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.680]   you develop an interesting connection
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.680]   in Romans chapter one, that idolatry is connected
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.200]   to our inclination to become control freaks.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.960]   I wanna pick that up tomorrow.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.120]   Thanks for joining us on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.680]   with guest Richard Lentz.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.840]   We'll see you tomorrow.
