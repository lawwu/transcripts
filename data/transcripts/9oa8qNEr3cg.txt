[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   Previously on Grace To You.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.200]   But ideologies in the current climate are seductive to people because they are mindless.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.300]   But what they want you to do is accept the, buy the package and shut down alternative discussions.
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.640]   We think critically because we think biblically.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.660]   And we have the mind of Christ. 1 Corinthians 2.16, you have the mind of Christ.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.680]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.180]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:59.540]   If there would ever be a
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.660]   gospel, I would say,
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.500]   nation of people who held the truth, it would be certainly our nation as well as most of the western world.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.560]   We have had the Bible. We've had the revelation of God.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.680]   We all are very much aware that that has been rejected in our nation wholesale.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.380]   And as a result of that, the wrath of God has been revealed.
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.460]   It is revealed against any society, any culture, any people who hold the truth in
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.520]   unrighteousness.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.820]   unrighteousness, who turn from God.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.180]   And that's exactly what our society has done.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.780]   And Romans, chapter 1 defines the wrath of God.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.860]   It says this is what it is: God, when He judges the society for rejecting Him, turns them
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.280]   over to a sexual revolution.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.840]   It's explicit.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.640]   We have had that thirty years ago, I suppose, the sexual revolution; that was the first
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.140]   sign of divine judgment.
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:12.220]   He lets men go into sexual unrighteousness, pornography, really the death of any sense
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.020]   of biblical morality.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.440]   But there's a second step in Romans 1, and that is there will be a sexual revolution,
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.600]   and then there will be a homosexual revolution.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.360]   Paul explicitly mentions that.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360]   Men with men.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720]   Men with women.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.920]   And this produces many effects.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.260]   One he talks about, I think he's referring even to venereal disease, which could be seen
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.160]   as AIDS.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.980]   So when God judges a nation that has rejected His truth, there will be a sexual revolution
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.600]   followed by a homosexual revolution, which we've been watching for the last couple of
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   decades.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.080]   But the third point is, he says, God gives them over.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.760]   God gives them over to sexual perversion.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.820]   God gives them over to homosexuality.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.240]   Then God gives them over to a reprobate mind.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.180]   Reprobate mind is a non-functioning mind.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.940]   And what that means is the final step in divine judgment is a kind of insanity where nothing
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.440]   makes sense.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.180]   And out of that, Paul in Romans, chapter 1, lists a long list of every imaginable kind
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.800]   of wickedness.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.960]   Wickedness and sin.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.300]   That will literally flood and drown a society.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.900]   In the middle of that list, of course, is deceit and the hatred of God.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.860]   So there's a reason why this country is in the insanity that it is in, and it is the
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.240]   judgment of God.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.120]   God has allowed this nation that has rejected Him to go down the path of Romans 1 through
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.520]   a sexual revolution.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.760]   A sexual revolution to the point where there is an insanity that really makes no sense
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.200]   to any thinking person.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.660]   It's a reprobate mind.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.660]   It's a mind that does not function.
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:20.060]   And out of that mind that doesn't function comes every imaginable kind of evil.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.860]   It was John Calvin who made the interesting statement that when God judges a people, He
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.240]   gives them wickedness.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.720]   Wicked rulers.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.860]   When God judges a people, He gives them wicked rulers.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.000]   So this judgment of God that has sent us down this careening path of transgression, iniquity,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.880]   and sin is also aided and abetted by wicked rulers because they tend to be the architects
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.660]   of all of this, if not overtly, certainly covertly.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.960]   So I just want to say that you have to look at this in the light of God.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.440]   You have to look at this in the light of divine judgment.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.260]   What is happening in our country?
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.840]   The chaos, the insanity, the nonsense, the things that you can't figure out, the confusion,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   the disorder, the disruption is all part of divine judgment.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.780]   And if you understand it that way, you're going to realize that you can't fix it.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.300]   You can't fix it.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.680]   We are under judgment at a severe level.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   The most severe level revealed in Scripture, short of final global judgment, yet to come
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.740]   the end of the age and eternal judgment in hell.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.360]   So what is wrong in this country is not fixable.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.200]   This is God bringing judgment.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.420]   The good news is that He protects His people in the judgment, that His cover is over us.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.980]   We are in the shelter of His protection.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.400]   We are saved from the wrath to come, and we are protected.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.600]   We are saved in the current judgment.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.800]   But I just want you to understand that the church has one great responsibility in the
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.140]   midst of this judgment.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.520]   It's not to try to fix what's wrong in society.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.060]   That same chapter, Romans 1, gives us our mandate.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.560]   Paul says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God and
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.120]   the salvation to everyone who believes, the Jew and the Gentile."
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.540]   Our responsibility is to preach the gospel, not to be ashamed of the gospel, but to preach
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.820]   the gospel, which is the only answer.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.320]   The only hope is Christ.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.800]   The only appropriate response to Christ is to embrace Him as Lord and Savior and to embrace
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.720]   His glorious gospel.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.840]   So what do we do in a time like this?
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840]   Well.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.720]   Very clear calling, as I said, to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.340]   The church needs to become Christ-centered.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.440]   For the church to reach the world, it has to stop trying to be like the world, because
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:15.060]   why would you want to identify with a society under judgment?
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.520]   Understand that what's going wrong in our society is divine judgment.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.440]   We have to be the church, the haven.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.560]   We have to be the church.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.240]   We have to be the eye of the hurricane.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.980]   We have to be the safe place.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:34.220]   We have to be the place where Christ is exalted and the Word of God is proclaimed.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:41.160]   Truth is known and believed and lived and taught.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.220]   We have the mind of Christ, and it's in the pages of Scripture.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.560]   Jesus said in John 12, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men to Myself."
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.940]   This is the time for the church to focus on lifting up Christ.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.040]   And that, of course, is the theme of the text that we're looking at.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:12.120]   Turn to Ephesians, chapter 1, Ephesians, chapter 1.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.960]   This marvelous epistle directed at the church and the life of the church starts out with
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.280]   an entire first chapter that is as magnificent.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:30.040]   Magnificent a portrait of Christ as you will find anywhere in the Bible.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:39.460]   It is so profound, and it ties the person of Christ to His people, to His people.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:46.680]   It shows us Christ, and it shows us our place in Christ.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.000]   You remember in verse 3 this amazing, comprehensive statement.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.760]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.740]   spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ."
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:09.460]   In the middle of the judgment, we are the blessed, and our blessings are in Christ.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:19.820]   And follow the flow of this, because, verse 4, we were chosen in Him; because, verse 6,
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.720]   saving grace was freely bestowed on us.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.180]   "In the beloved."
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:32.760]   Verse 7, "In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins."
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:41.000]   Verse 9, at the end of the verse, "God's purposes are in Him."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.300]   Verse 10, "Everything is summed up in Christ."
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.440]   The end of verse 10 into verse 11, "In Him we have obtained an inheritance."
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:59.240]   Verse 12, "We who were the first to hope in Christ would be the praise of His glory.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.000]   In Him you received the truth, the gospel of your salvation."
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.900]   Verse 13, end of verse 13, "In Him you are sealed with the spirit of promise."
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.400]   Everything is in Christ.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.560]   Everything is in Christ, and Christ is everything.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.160]   That's what we've been trying to say.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:28.460]   Given all those glorious realities in verses 3 through 14, Paul, in verse 15, prays for
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.220]   us to understand that.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:38.540]   It's a prayer for us to get a grip on these great doctrinal truths that speak of things
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:46.140]   that we possess in possessing all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies in Christ.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.880]   So as we looked at it last week, let me just remind you of this passage.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.880]   "For this reason, I am not a sinner.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:58.200]   For this reason," verse 15, "because of all that is ours, because we are in Him, of all
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.440]   that He is to us."
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.600]   He says, "I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.240]   your love for all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you while making mention
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.980]   of you in my prayers.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.060]   I'm thankful for you.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:19.600]   I know you're true believers because two things: you have faith in the Lord Jesus," verse
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   15.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.240]   "And you have love for all the saints.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.520]   You believe in Christ and manifest yourself in love.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.020]   So I do not cease giving thanks."
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.060]   So he knows he's talking to a believing church, evidenced by their faith in the Lord Jesus
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.720]   and their love for all saints.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.360]   "But I have a request," he says, verse 16, "while I make mention of you in my prayers."
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.760]   And here's my request, verse 17.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:49.380]   "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.320]   wisdom and of revelation.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.860]   A spirit of revelation in the knowledge of Him."
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.360]   You already know Him in terms of salvation.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.420]   You already know Him in terms of understanding the gospel.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.560]   But I want you to have far more understanding of Christ.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.820]   I want God to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:20.040]   And of course, that spirit is produced in us by the Holy Spirit, who in Isaiah 11 is
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.660]   called the spirit of wisdom.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:28.860]   I want the Spirit of God to give you wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.400]   I want your knowledge of Christ to increase.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.800]   Knowledge is deep knowledge, deep knowledge.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.600]   It's a specific Greek word for that.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.760]   So that you spend essentially your Christian life getting to know Christ better and better.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.740]   And better and better.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.880]   So the Christian life is not hard to figure out.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.140]   It's coming to know Christ, and know Him more, and know Him more.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.700]   You have the apostle Paul in Philippians saying, "That I may know Him, that I may know Him."
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.160]   And you might say, "Paul, you know Him.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   You know Him.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   You preach Him.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   You love Him.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   You live for Him.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.640]   But I want to know Him more, know Him more."
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:18.120]   This is not some wish for some mystical experience; this is for his mind to be able to grasp the
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.480]   fullness of Christ.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   And so, the Bible says, "I will know Him more than I know Christ, as revealed from heaven
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   and for us in Scripture."
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.200]   When Paul writes to Titus in Titus, chapter 1, he introduces the letter by saying, "Paul,
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.600]   a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.040]   knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness."
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.200]   Godliness is connected to the knowledge of the truth.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   Listen to 1 Peter 1:3, "According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:07.960]   of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood."
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:18.920]   In other words, Paul is an apostle to the chosen for the purpose of instructing them
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.020]   to obey Jesus Christ.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:27.480]   And as you gaze at the glory of the Lord and the knowledge of Him becomes yours, Paul says
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.780]   to the Corinthians, "You will be changed into His image from one level of glory to
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.500]   the next."
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.560]   This is what the Christian life is about.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:45.520]   The church exists in the process of sanctification to become like Christ, which happens when
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.640]   you look at Christ, and you grow in your knowledge.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.580]   And you grow in your knowledge and love, and you are better able to reflect Him.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.720]   I want you to understand your calling.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.240]   What is that?
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:10.600]   Your calling is the call of God that occurred in eternity past.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:18.360]   Your calling, your divine calling, the effectual calling.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.200]   And you are not just a calling that is being referred to.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.600]   Go back to verse 4 of chapter 1.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   "That calling occurred because God chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:48.080]   That calling occurred because He predestined us to adoption as sons."
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.340]   And inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:16:01.760]   the counsel of His will, to the end, the result, that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.580]   would be to the praise of His glory.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580]   What do you mean?
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.240]   We would be taken all the way to eternal glory.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.960]   Verse 14 calls it the redemption of God's own possession to the praise of His glory.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.800]   Now look at the sweeping reality of verse 7.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.560]   Verse 18: "I want you to understand the doctrine of election.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.320]   I want you to understand the doctrine of predestination."
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.360]   Some people say, "If you believe in predestination, it will make you lazy.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.100]   It will make you indifferent.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.360]   If you really understand the doctrine of predestination, it will make you thankful, and then it will
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:43.440]   make you holy, and then it will make you joyful, and then it will fill your life with security."
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.520]   You need to understand that you were chosen.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:54.560]   You were predestined, called to eternal glory.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.640]   Think about it.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:05.200]   Before time began, God chose you, predestined you to eternal glory, called you in time,
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:13.920]   granted you faith to believe the gospel, justified you, and set you for glory.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.240]   And it's going to take place, because in verse 13 it says, "You were sealed."
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:24.780]   "You were sealed unto that glorious end by the Holy Spirit, who is God's guarantee,
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.540]   the Holy Spirit of promise."
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:34.060]   So when you're focusing on Christ, focus on that which is eternal.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.500]   You have to fly over life in this world.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.040]   Go from eternity past to eternity future.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   Think on that.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.840]   Set your affections on things above and not on things on the earth.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.840]   It's not going to get better.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.960]   You can't fix it.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.680]   Let's set our affections in the heavenlies.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.820]   This is a very short time, and while we're here, we need to set our affections on things
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.840]   above.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:09.920]   When you know His plan, there's no fear, no anxiety, no neurosis, no panic, no dread,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.680]   because it's all planned, and you are protected to the end of the plan.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.980]   You say, "Well, how am I protected?"
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.360]   Because Christ is your protector.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.820]   You say, "Well, okay, He has a plan, and He's my protector.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.020]   Does He have the power to protect me?"
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.780]   Look at verse 19.
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:41.120]   So we want to know if we're going to have this glorious inheritance in the future that
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.960]   our protector is Abel.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.560]   So he says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.160]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.600]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.100]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."

[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."

[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   He says, "I want your inheritance."

[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:36.740]   We are His body, and He fills us with His fullness.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.980]   There's so much doctrine and so much theology in this.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.360]   This is the message we need to preach.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:52.920]   It's about Jesus Christ, who is absolutely everything, and the only hope of salvation,
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.160]   and the only deliverance from judgment.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:08.960]   Father, we thank You for leading us as You do through Your Spirit and Your Word to understand
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:20.480]   the greatness of Christ, His plan, His power, His person.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.920]   Thank You for the choosing of us before the world began.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:38.720]   Thank You for predestining us to be joint heirs with Christ and to receive an inheritance
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.020]   with Him in Your glorious presence.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.960]   Help us to live with our affections set on things above and not on things on the earth,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:55.680]   and live transcendently, triumphantly, even in the midst of judgment, and help us not
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.840]   to be disillusioned by the devil, but rather to love Christ, worship Christ, increase constantly
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:09.960]   in the knowledge of Christ, but to proclaim Him who alone can rescue sinners from the
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.540]   kingdom of darkness.
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.880]   May this be our passion.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.600]   Well, I've always known about Christ because I grew up in a Christian family.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.020]   My dad was a faithful pastor and preacher of the Word of God, and particularly loved
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.020]   to preach the gospel.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.300]   So I knew all the stories about Christ.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.980]   I knew about him, but I think it was about the age of nine or ten when I had done something
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.260]   that I shouldn't have done.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.340]   It was vandalism with another kid, and I was feeling guilty about that.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:44.380]   And I knew about Christ, but I was afraid that I didn't really have my sins forgiven.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.660]   And so I remember sitting on the steps of the church with my dad and confessing to what
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.840]   I had done and asking him how I could be sure that my sin was forgiven.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.780]   And that was a...
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.840]   That was a very memorable time in my young life.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.900]   There was another time like that, another event like that, after my freshman year in
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.660]   university, when I was thrown out of a car going 70 miles an hour, and I slid down the
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:14.440]   highway about 110 yards and should have been dead, but I survived that.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.880]   And it was at that moment that I realized that life was very fragile.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.900]   And while I certainly trusted Christ and believed in Him as my Savior and Lord, I was still
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.900]   in the midst of a very difficult time.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:23.900]   I was in the midst of a very difficult time.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:23.980]   I was in the midst of a very difficult time.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.120]   I was in the midst of a very difficult time.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.140]   I was in the midst of a very difficult time.
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:24.240]   I was in the midst of a very difficult time.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:24.340]   I was in the midst of a very difficult time.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:24.420]   I was in the midst of a very difficult time.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.560]   Lord, I was much more interested in what I wanted
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.860]   out of life than what I thought he might want.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.740]   That was the waterloo of my own ambition.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.880]   Everything that I thought I wanted for myself
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.280]   died on that highway.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.140]   I lived, but there's a whole lot of John MacArthur
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.460]   that died, and I remember being three months in bed
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:51.040]   recovering from the burns from skidding on the highway.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.780]   That I solidified that relationship to Christ
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.240]   and completely, agreeably, and happily
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.980]   yielded up my life to Him.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.300]   I remember saying something like,
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.920]   if you're going to fight like that, I give.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.740]   I can't battle against that.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.440]   And it was a wonderful time.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.900]   I recovered from all the injuries,
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.780]   and from then it was clear focus on heading to seminary.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.620]   And that relationship with Christ continued to flourish
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.660]   all the way into my preaching ministry
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:22.300]   where I spent probably 25 years of my pulpit ministry
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.140]   preaching on the person of Christ,
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.680]   from the four gospels,
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.900]   and another 10 years at least writing commentaries
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.900]   on those same gospels.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.500]   So I've never been able to let go of the Christ
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.500]   that I first really met when I was about nine or 10 years old.
