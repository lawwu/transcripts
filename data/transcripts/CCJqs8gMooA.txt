[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.680]   I'd like to invite everybody to stand.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.300]   Here this morning, Jesus' words to his disciples, to us, how we are to go, make disciples of
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.560]   all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:52.000]   We have a promise in the Psalms that has the same characteristics where God is saying,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.240]   we will be exalted.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.320]   Psalm 46 verses 10 and 11 say, "Be still and know that I am God," and he's saying to these
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.600]   nations who are in such an uproar, he said, "Be still!"
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.320]   It's not like a promise box verse, "Be still and know that I am God.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.900]   I will be exalted among the nations.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.480]   I will be exalted in the earth."
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.800]   It's that divine authority, and he says, "The Lord of hosts is with us.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.000]   The God of Jacob is our fortress."
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.240]   We're about to sing "A Mighty Fortress is Our God" based on this psalm.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.220]   I just want to remind us that these words aren't true because we sing them.
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.760]   We sing them because they're true.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:02:17.160]   "A mighty fortress is our God, the whole world ever failing.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:29.560]   For still our ancient foe, the seed to work us whole, his wrath and power are great.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:41.800]   An arm with brutal pain, on earth is not his equal.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:51.720]   If we in our own strength would fought, our striding would be losing.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   Word of the right and of our son, the man of God's own choosing.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:14.760]   The task of that may be, Christ Jesus is king, for sovereign of his name.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:28.600]   From age to age, the spirit changes and he must win the battle.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:41.480]   And though this world with devils will should present to undo us, we will not fear, for
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.760]   God has built this fruit to triumph through us.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:04:02.120]   The prince of darkness thrift, we tremble not for him, his grace we can ensure.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:15.560]   For though his doom is sure, a little word shall help him.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:25.960]   And word above all earthly powers, O thanks to them abided.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:36.680]   The spirit and the gifts are ours, through him who with us sided.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:50.600]   Let good and kindred go, this mortal life also, the body they may build.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:05:02.760]   God's truth abideth still, his kingdom is forever.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.840]   Amen!
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:24.120]   Let the glory, let the glory of the Lord, for ev'ry heart and soul, may retention be
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.160]   the theme of our song.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:38.760]   For by grace we have been saved, and by grace we shall relate, to the corners of the earth
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.360]   that Christ has come.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:56.200]   Let the nations be glad, let the people rejoice, for salvation belongs to our God.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:07.160]   Let the whole world be filled with the praise of the Lord, for salvation belongs to our
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.360]   God.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:16.680]   Let the nations be glad.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:25.800]   Though the age has gone before, through the trial and the sore, many saints and martyrs
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.720]   conquered, though they died, still we're holding out for the cross.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:43.560]   Crossing oceans of remorse, we shall endure all things to win the crown of life.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:57.160]   Let the nations be glad, let the people rejoice, for salvation belongs to our God.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:10.200]   Let the whole earth be filled with the praises of the Lord, for salvation belongs to our
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.400]   God.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:22.680]   Let the nations be glad.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:35.800]   Let the whole world be filled with the praise of the Lord, for salvation belongs to our
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.840]   God.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:50.680]   Let the whole world be filled with the praise of the Lord, for salvation belongs to our
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.240]   God.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:08:04.840]   Let the nations be glad, let the people rejoice, for salvation belongs to our God.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:15.640]   Let the whole earth be filled with the praises of the Lord, for salvation belongs to our
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.840]   God.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.520]   Let the nations be glad.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.520]   Sing let the nations be glad again.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:39.240]   Let the nations be glad, let the people rejoice, for salvation belongs to our God.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:51.480]   Let the whole earth be filled with the praises of the Lord, for salvation belongs to our
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.200]   God.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:01.960]   Let the nations be glad.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:07.000]   You know, a lot of us are going to return home to our churches and think, "This was
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.240]   amazing what we had at this conference, and I just want everybody in my church to feel
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.440]   what I'm feeling right now."
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:19.480]   We're going to be so discouraged by the response of people.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:26.840]   So I so appreciated what Joel said earlier.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.160]   When you're discouraged in your ministry, remember your future.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.160]   We get so caught up in what's going on right now.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.560]   But there is a future that awaits us.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.640]   He said, "We will gaze on Him and never have to look away."
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:53.320]   And John got a picture of that in the book of Revelation, and the Lord had him write
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.960]   it down for us.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.880]   Revelation 7, verses 9 and 10.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.000]   "After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number."
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.400]   This is where we're headed, because of what Jesus Christ has done.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:17.720]   From every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:27.240]   and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:37.720]   out with a loud voice, "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, to the
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.220]   Lamb.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.280]   You will never have to look away."
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:55.560]   So let's look at Him right now, to the eyes of faith.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:08.040]   Crown Him, crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:21.160]   Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:38.040]   Awake, my soul, and sing of Him who died for thee, and hail Him as thy matchless King
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   through all eternity.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:12:01.960]   Crown Him Son of God before the world's beginning, and He who tread where He hath trod,
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:17.320]   crown Him the Son of Man, who every grief hath known, that brings the human breast,
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:28.840]   and takes and bears them for His own, that all in Him may rest.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.800]   [MUSIC - "CROWN HIM"]
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.280]   Crown Him, Lord of love.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.800]   Behold His hands and side.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:56.280]   Those wounds yet miserable of love, in beauty glorified.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:06.760]   No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:16.760]   But Thou forbid'st his wandering eye at mystery so bright.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:35.640]   Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed o'er the grave,
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:46.120]   and rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:56.520]   To the glories now we sing, who died and rose on high,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:04.520]   who died eternal lives to bring, and lives that death may die.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:24.520]   Crown Him the Lord of lords, who over all the grave,
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:35.720]   who once on earth incarnate were for ransom sinners slain,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:46.520]   now lives in realms of life where saints with angels sing.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:59.720]   Their songs we pour Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:12.200]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.960]   Lord, we look forward to that day when wherever we look,
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.200]   we will see You.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.400]   We'll never have to turn away.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:28.360]   Thank You that You are worthy of endless praises
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.160]   of all creation, and in Your mercy,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.440]   You've called us to be a part of that endless praise.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:45.960]   Use us, we pray, by Your Spirit to bring You glory,
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.920]   not only in our songs, but through our lives.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.800]   Amen.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.300]   Amen.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.720]   Let's be seated.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.440]   And can we welcome Michael Reeves.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.920]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:29.240]   [MUSIC - "THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER"]
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:39.280]   Brothers, it is my simple but awesome privilege
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.840]   to hold out the glory of God now.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:52.320]   For the glory of God is the epicenter, the genesis,
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:59.720]   the principle of all healthy mission.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.760]   When the mission of the church goes wrong,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.000]   it is always because she has become man-centered.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:19.920]   Sometimes it is that Christians fear God more than man.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.920]   And so they do no mission not wanting to offend or confront.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.600]   Sometimes they lose sight of God's truth,
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.520]   and so they do no mission, or only a mission
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.320]   which is giving sinners the worldly things they already
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:37.820]   want.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:46.400]   And sometimes they love the glory of man
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:54.280]   more than the glory of God, and nobody notices the problem.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.560]   Because they seem orthodox.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.640]   They seem zealous.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.160]   But they are preaching Christ out of selfish ambition,
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.240]   making little empires for themselves.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.840]   And so as a remedy, we're going to look
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:23.480]   at the first three verses of John Chapter 17, Jesus'
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.000]   High Priestly Prayer.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.640]   Let me pray as we come to God's Word.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:42.600]   Oh, Holy Father, open our eyes that we might know you better.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.240]   And so have the life that comes in knowing you.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:54.080]   And so may we, weary ones, proud ones, tired ones,
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.040]   all be enlivened by the knowledge of you.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.880]   Have life and overflow with life for the blessing of the world
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.400]   and the glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.520]   And in his name we ask it.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.020]   Amen.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.320]   Amen.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.480]   Well, here in Jesus' High Priestly Prayer,
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.960]   our great high priest, we enter the true holy place
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.840]   of God's presence.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.960]   And you remember, just as the Old Testament
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:29.080]   tabernacle, which was its copy and shadow,
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.960]   that was filled with God's glory.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.040]   So look at what fills this place.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.440]   I'll read the first five verses.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   Jesus spoke these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.760]   he said, "Father, the hour has come.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:54.800]   Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you,
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.360]   even as you gave him authority over all flesh,
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:06.680]   that to all whom you have given him he may give eternal life."
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.360]   And this is eternal life, "that they
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.440]   may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.080]   whom you have sent.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.080]   I glorified you on the earth, having
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.600]   finished the work with which you have given me to do.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.200]   Now, Father, glorify me together with yourself,
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:33.520]   with the glory which I had with you before the world was."
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.960]   Here is a glimpse behind the curtain
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.360]   to see a heavenly conversation, and one
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.360]   that lifts our eyes to heaven.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:54.840]   And all John's gospel has been ramping up to this moment.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:01.480]   At Cana in chapter 2, Jesus told his mother, "Woman,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.360]   my hour has not yet come."
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.760]   Later, he was teaching in the temple,
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:16.200]   and no one seized him because his hour had not yet come.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:22.880]   Now, he says, "Father, the hour has come."
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.760]   This is the hour he described in chapter 12,
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.280]   the hour for the Son of Man to be glorified
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.240]   as he is lifted up from the earth, lifted up on the cross,
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.160]   lifted up in his resurrection, lifted up
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.960]   in his heavenly exaltation.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:47.120]   This is the hour for which Jesus came.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.240]   And you see, his whole purpose in it
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.360]   is that the Father might glorify the Son,
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.440]   that the Son might glorify the Father.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.320]   Now, I want you to notice the logic of verses 1 and 2.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.000]   Look closely.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.640]   Jesus says, verse 1, clause A, "Father, the hour has come.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.120]   Glorify your Son."
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:21.880]   Clause B, "That," consequence, "that the Son may glorify you."
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.640]   Connecting even as or just as--
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.320]   you see the mirroring here between verses 1 and 2.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.740]   Clause A, "You gave him authority over all flesh."
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:40.280]   Clause B, consequence, "That to all whom you have given him,
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.200]   he may give eternal life."
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.680]   So the Son's glorification of the Father, verse 1b,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.160]   is the consequence of the Father's glorification
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.560]   of the Son.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.640]   And in parallel, verse 2, the Son's giving of eternal life,
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.800]   verse 2b, is the consequence of his being given authority,
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.560]   verse 2a.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.280]   So the two verses parallel each other.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:19.320]   They work together so that we can see the overall logic,
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:26.680]   which is, ultimately, the glorifying of the Son, "that
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.080]   eternal life be given."
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.200]   You could compress it like this.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.680]   "Glorify your Son, that he may give eternal life."
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:48.120]   Life flows from the glory of the Son,
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.640]   which glorifies the Father.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:58.440]   In other words, dear friends, mission starts not with you.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.480]   It starts with the glory of God.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:06.960]   The giving of life is the consequence
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.680]   of glory with this God.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:16.240]   Mission does not start with us.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.000]   Mission does not start with us finding the zeal within
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.520]   ourselves to go out and do something in our own strength.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.080]   And yet, we often talk as if it did.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.520]   We separate the glory of God from mission,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.040]   as if we have our devotional lives on one side,
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   where we glory in God, and know him, and enjoy him.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.920]   And then there's this separate extra thing
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.880]   called mission, which has a different motivation.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.680]   And when you think like that, one of two
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.920]   things is going to happen.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:04.600]   You will burn out, and/or you will do your mission and your
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.040]   ministry with another glory in mind--
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.280]   the glory of man.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:18.080]   So brothers, here's a litmus test for you.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:25.800]   Do you find yourself constantly overwhelmed by ministry,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.920]   sensing the burden stops with you?
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.160]   You're the initiator.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:38.920]   Or do you find yourself constantly concerned with what
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.280]   people think of you?
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.760]   Do you long for more approval, fame, recognition?
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:57.600]   Either way, in good part, the root problem
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.880]   is probably the same.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.320]   The glory of God has dipped in your esteem,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.680]   has ceased to be your energizing motivation,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.760]   and therefore, taking your eye off the glory of God,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.920]   you are looking for life and glory elsewhere.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.040]   And of course, it hurts and doesn't satisfy.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:27.520]   And so for our health, and the health of our ministries,
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.960]   for the healthy mission of the church,
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:36.800]   we need to refocus on the glory that gives life.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.920]   So let's do that now.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.800]   Now, what is this glory?
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.600]   What does Jesus mean when he says,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.000]   "Father, glorify your Son"?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.280]   Now, throughout John's gospel, Jesus
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.680]   has been setting us up to see Jesus' glory is
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.800]   something entirely unexpected.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:06.000]   We assume, and the Pharisees assumed,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.880]   glory means searching for the acclaim of others.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:18.440]   But Jesus said, "I do not seek my glory.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:24.000]   If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing."
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.280]   No, the one who is the very glory of God himself,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.120]   he does not need glory.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.240]   He's not acquisitively seeking glory,
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:42.800]   for his glory is not [AUDIO OUT]
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   He has no need.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.720]   His is a self-giving glory.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:55.920]   The Spirit glorifies the Son, Jesus tells us,
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.800]   by taking from what is mine and giving it,
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.520]   disclosing it to you, John 16.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.800]   Or John 12, Jesus describes exactly what
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.160]   it means for the Son of Man to be glorified.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.680]   Remember John 12, verse 24?
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.360]   "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.080]   falls to the earth and dies, it remains alone.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.760]   But if it dies, it bears fruit."
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:37.720]   That death-bearing fruit, that is the hour of his glorification.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:45.040]   When he dies, it is when he is lifted up from the earth,
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.960]   then we see most clearly who he is.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.600]   Then we see the glorification of the glory of God.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:00.280]   We see the deepest revelation of the very heart of God.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:08.520]   And it is all about laying down his life to give life as a seed.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.880]   Or as he puts it here, "That to all whom you have given him,
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.680]   he may give eternal life."
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.160]   So his self-giving is the hour of his glorification.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.520]   It is the nature of his glory.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.800]   Or in Paul's words in Ephesians, it
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.640]   is in the riches of his grace that we
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.440]   see the riches of his glory.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:44.360]   He is the radiance of the Father of glory,
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.520]   the one who is so superabounding in life and blessedness
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.840]   that he generates glory.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:58.720]   Without need or lack, his is the glory
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.440]   of the overflowing fountain of life.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:10.720]   In his hour, we see a divine glory
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:16.080]   that shines light into darkness, that confers good,
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.360]   that gives life and righteousness
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.800]   to unworthy, helpless sinners.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   And in that, with that end of verse 1,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.960]   the Son glorifies the Father.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:41.720]   And so on the cross, their God is glorified.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.080]   For when you've seen the Son, you've seen the Father.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.680]   When you've seen the self-giving of the Son,
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.080]   you've witnessed the very heart of the Father who sent him.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:59.160]   You've witnessed the superabundant graciousness
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.840]   and goodness of God himself, loving first
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.600]   before we ever loved him.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:12.240]   That is what the only true God is like.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.120]   The Son, who is the radiance of God's glory,
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:22.520]   shows us that God's glory is an outgoing, radiant thing,
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.520]   which is why throughout Scripture, the glory of God
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.920]   is so often compared to a pure and dazzling light ever
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.680]   shining outwards.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.760]   Arise, shine, your light has come,
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.880]   and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   The shepherds kept their flocks outside Bethlehem.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.480]   The glory of the Lord shone on them.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:58.200]   In the new Jerusalem, it has no need of sun or moon
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:04.120]   to shine on it, for the glory of God illumines it,
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.360]   and its lamp is the Lamb.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.560]   As the sun in the sky gives of its own light and heat,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:24.560]   so this God glories in giving of himself because he is so full.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.960]   Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:38.720]   And verse 2, then, even though it does not mention glory,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.680]   is actually unpacking the meaning of glory developed
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.120]   by the thought of verse 1.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.600]   Now, remember the logic.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   Verse 1, clause A, "Father, the hour has come.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.880]   Glorify your Son."
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.920]   B, "That, in order that the Son may glorify you,
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.880]   even as," mirroring clause A, "you gave him authority
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.600]   over all flesh," clause B, "so that to all
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.760]   whom you've given him he may give eternal life."
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.080]   Now, see the mirroring there.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   Now, glorifying your Son may not sound obviously
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.600]   like giving him authority over all flesh,
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.800]   but we know they're connected, "even as."
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.720]   So the Father lifts up the Son on the cross,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.400]   in the resurrection, in his exaltation,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.880]   to glorify the Father, "even as."
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.800]   That means to give eternal life.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.320]   This is just what Paul said in Philippians 2.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.840]   "God exalted him, bestowed on him
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.760]   the name that is above every name,
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:57.400]   so that at the name of Jesus every knee may bow,
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.680]   of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.440]   and that every tongue will confess
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.480]   that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.680]   God is glorified and revealed for who
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:14.760]   he is in the giving of life through the lifting up
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.440]   of the Son.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.640]   And that is why the glory of God is the epicenter of mission.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:28.920]   God gives life because he is so gloriously super-sufficient,
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.240]   so full, so overflowing.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.000]   That is his glory, to shine out into the darkness
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.960]   in pure grace until that day when the earth will be
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.040]   filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.720]   as the waters cover the sea.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:56.960]   And that is why the glory of this God
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.720]   makes Christians delight to lift him up,
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.880]   delight to proclaim the honors of his name.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:11.120]   You see, if God were an empty God,
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:17.600]   if he were a needy idol, motivated primarily
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.800]   by getting something from us that he needed,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:27.640]   that he didn't already have, if that were what God were like,
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.240]   then he would be a burden.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   To be like him would mean loving the glory of man,
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.400]   because that's what clearly he loves.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.120]   Proclaiming him would be a heavy, burdensome duty.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.600]   All he's trying to do is take.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:54.640]   But because God is the only true God, is so full,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.440]   so overflowing with life, mission simply
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.560]   flows from who he is.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.120]   When we proclaim Christ, we are joining in
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.480]   with a pre-existent mission.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.000]   We are joining in with the divine outgoing,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.160]   with a mission that does not depend on us for its genesis
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.040]   or its momentum.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.240]   As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you,
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   we just join in.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:42.280]   Which means, if the glory of God outshining
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:51.360]   is the genesis chamber and the delight-giving motivation that
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.160]   makes saints go out and speak of him
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.440]   and shine out themselves then, it
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:09.840]   means, friends, if you take your eyes off the glory of Christ,
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.960]   the thought of proclaiming him to the ends of the earth
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.760]   will feel overwhelming to you.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.200]   If the buck's going to stop with you, that's a burden.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:26.880]   And then other motivations will start to drive you.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.440]   But see the glory that gives life,
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.760]   and you will be enlivened.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:47.880]   His glory will eclipse yours and be a greater motivation,
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:53.560]   a preceding motivation that precedes any zeal you have,
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.720]   but stirs it up.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.800]   And come now to verse 3, where we
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.560]   see the nature of the eternal life he gives.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:12.240]   "This is eternal life, that they may know you the only true God
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.360]   and Jesus Christ, whom you've sent."
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:21.680]   Now, because life is in God, you cannot have
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.520]   any life apart from God.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.960]   Life is not an abstract commodity he throws out.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:38.320]   Life is found in him, and so in knowing him,
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:45.960]   and not just knowing any God, but knowing the only true God,
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.920]   in knowing the Father by knowing Jesus Christ, his Son,
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.880]   through the enabling power of the Spirit.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.800]   So verse 2, spot the logic here.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.200]   Verse 2 had shown the Son is given authority
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.720]   in order to give life.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.520]   And verse 3 logically follows.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.680]   If the Son is to bring that life,
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:14.400]   he must bring people to know God,
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.200]   because that is what life is.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.480]   And how does he do that?
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:27.160]   By glorifying and revealing God in himself,
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.880]   because no one knows God, but through him,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.640]   and only through him, we come to know the only true God,
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.560]   and so have life.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:42.640]   No one has ever seen God, but God, the only begotten,
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.760]   who is in the bosom of the Father, he explains him.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.920]   And so life is found in knowing the Father through him.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:56.840]   Life is found in knowing God.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:04.840]   That means, friends, if you would have much life,
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:11.040]   be a theologian, be a knower of God.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:22.440]   For the knowledge of God is not interesting trivia.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.120]   It is not something to be enjoyed
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.640]   when you have a bit of spare time.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:32.720]   The knowledge of God is life.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:42.040]   And if your knowledge of God is shallow and weak,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.680]   you will be shallow and weak.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:52.080]   But Daniel 11:32, "The people who know their God
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.400]   will display strength and take action."
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.120]   The people who know their God will display strength
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.640]   because they have life.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.280]   But it's only those who know God who have that strength.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:15.480]   It all means we must not separate mission,
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.400]   making Christ known, from knowing God.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.320]   As if knowing God is an impractical nicety
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.960]   we put on one side when we feel like being active
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.160]   and going out and doing this thing called mission.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.560]   No.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.720]   A good missionary must be a good theologian.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:41.360]   You know, John Calvin is a marvelous example of this.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.000]   We often-- we usually think of John Calvin as a theologian,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.800]   and we should.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.920]   But don't imagine Calvin cooped up in a library
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.800]   thinking heavenly thoughts, unconcerned
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.640]   with the growth of the church on earth.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:02.320]   No, he educated in Geneva, primarily through the academy,
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.200]   a generation of pastors in the knowledge of God
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.880]   in order to--
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:15.960]   to use John 17 language, that he might send them out
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.880]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.680]   So he gave them a knowledge of God
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:26.520]   and turned Geneva into a theologically-fueled center
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.600]   for the propagation of the gospel.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.360]   And there, he gave them the knowledge of God.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.000]   And from there, pastors and missionaries
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.920]   were sent out to Poland, the Netherlands, Italy, Hungary,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.200]   even South America.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:49.280]   He saw it must start with knowing God,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.720]   so he raised up those who know God,
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.000]   for it's only those who know God who have life
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.920]   and can go out and give life.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.400]   And it's exactly the same logic you
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.880]   see in Calvin's great work, The Institutes.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.560]   He starts the whole thing with knowing God
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.960]   and works from there towards the Christian life,
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.480]   because knowing God is the source of life.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:24.320]   And it must then be the source of healthy mission.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:32.200]   No knowledge of God, no mission.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:38.920]   Thin knowledge of God, thin mission.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.600]   Weak knowledge of God, weak mission.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:49.840]   But I don't want to stop there, because if we leave it there,
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.280]   we're going to misunderstand what knowing God means.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:44:02.160]   See, especially when I say be a theologian,
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.600]   you all think, oh, please no.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:13.120]   Because we easily imagine knowledge
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:23.640]   as this merely cerebral thing, knowledge about God,
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.720]   as if being a diligent student of Scripture
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.120]   and a careful exegete, that's knowledge,
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.960]   and therefore that's what gives life.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.160]   So if I'm a careful exegete and a diligent student
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.760]   of Scripture, hey, I've got life.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.360]   But the knowledge that Jesus speaks of here
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:51.480]   requires glorying in God.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.520]   Now, some commentators, they read verse 3
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.640]   about knowing God, and they see it
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.600]   as an aside that's got really nothing
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.640]   to do with the glory that the surrounding verses deal with.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:11.280]   But throughout John's gospel, knowledge
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.320]   is entirely bound up with glory.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.840]   And I want to see this, because this
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.480]   is critical if we are to have the knowledge that gives life.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.640]   Let's start with John 5 from verse 39.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:39.840]   John 5 from verse 39, Jesus says to the Jewish scribes,
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.760]   "You search the Scriptures because you
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.320]   think that in them you have eternal life.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:49.720]   It is these that bear witness about me, and you are not.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.920]   You are unwilling to come to me that you may have life.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.960]   I do not receive glory from men, but I know you,
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.280]   that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.360]   I've come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:12.040]   If another comes in his own name, you'll receive him.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:17.560]   How can you believe when you receive glory from one another?
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:28.400]   How can you believe when you receive glory from one another,
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.720]   and you do not seek the glory that is from the only God?"
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.000]   So the scribes and the Pharisees,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.680]   they thought they had life in the mere searching
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:44.880]   of Scripture, but they did not seek the glory of God.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:50.160]   And so they sought to be masters of Scripture
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.600]   in order to receive glory from each other.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:47:01.760]   And so seeking the glory of man, they never
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.240]   recognized the true glory of God.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.400]   And so they crucified him.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:12.440]   They crucified the Lord of glory and mocked him,
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.760]   for they did not know God.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.680]   They were blind to who was right in front of them.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.320]   It means because they didn't glory in him,
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.040]   all their knowledge was not true knowledge of God.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:37.160]   Oh, dear friends, it means that to glory in Jesus
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.040]   is not an optional extra for some emotional types.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:47.920]   You simply cannot know the only true God
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.880]   without glorying in him, because God is so glorious,
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.240]   he is not known where he is not adored.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:03.840]   If God, my friend, is not delightful to you,
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:11.800]   your eyes have not been opened, you are blind,
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:18.320]   and that reveals a deadness of head and heart.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   If God is not glorious, if he is not your delight and treasure,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.160]   you may know something about him,
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.280]   but you do not have the knowledge
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.600]   that is eternal life.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.200]   Knowledge requires glorying in him.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.360]   So glorious is he.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.640]   Come on to chapter 8 from verse 42.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.240]   Jesus said to them, "If God were your father,
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.920]   you would love me.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.040]   For I proceeded forth and have come from God.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.840]   For I have not even come of myself,
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.240]   but he sent me."
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.920]   John 8 43.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:13.040]   Why do you not understand what I'm saying?
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.080]   It is because you cannot hear my word.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.360]   You are of your father the devil,
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.920]   and you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.560]   Now, the word "understand" there in verse 43
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.440]   is gnosko, to know.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:32.040]   Jesus is saying, "You do not know
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.360]   if you have the desires of the devil,
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.400]   and so do not love God."
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.960]   The knowledge of God is entirely bound up with love for,
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.200]   desire for God.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:55.320]   Hence the terrible words of Paul to the Corinthians,
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:00.320]   "If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus,
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:06.680]   let him be anathema, accursed."
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.840]   And last reference describing the nature of true knowledge.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.480]   Come back to John 17 verse 26.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   Jesus concludes his prayer saying,
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.440]   "I have made your name known."
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.840]   John 17 26.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.240]   "I've made your name known to them.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.960]   I will make it known."
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.000]   This is knowledge.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.880]   "So that the love with which you loved me
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.520]   may be in them and I in them."
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.560]   To know God is to love him.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:50.440]   Now, a generation ago, Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.480]   argued that a false view of knowledge
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:51:00.440]   had become the great error of the church.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.080]   He said, "If I understand the condition of the church today,
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.720]   and indeed during the last 50 years or so,
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.240]   I would say its great trouble has
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.800]   been that it has fallen into this particular error,
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:19.080]   the error of Sandemanianism, the idea that saving faith
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.560]   is nothing but bare belief of the bare truth.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:29.120]   Sandemanianism taught knowledge of God
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.400]   is bare assent to the truth.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.920]   It is mere intellectual acknowledgment
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.520]   that the gospel is true.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.200]   It imagined our real problem as sinners
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.640]   is simply that we're ignorant.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.440]   What do you think that did to their sermons?
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:55.360]   If people's problem is just ignorance,
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.400]   what is a sermon for?
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:03.000]   Their sermons were purely education.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.480]   That's it.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.280]   Nothing more needed.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:13.320]   They never sought to deal with the hearts of their people,
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.760]   the affections, the desires.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.800]   They never sought to deal with their own hearts.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.400]   They failed to recognize that the human problem is
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.600]   deeper than ignorance.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.160]   The reason people do not believe in Jesus
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.560]   is not simply ignorance.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.960]   It is to do with what they love.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   Sinners love the darkness rather than the light.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.360]   The sinful mind is hostile to God
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:49.120]   and therefore refuses to love the truth
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.760]   and be saved, 2 Thessalonians.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.720]   See, both faith and unbelief involve more than the head.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.080]   Not less than, but more than.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:04.200]   Unbelief flows from a hostility of heart
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.280]   that hates the truth.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:12.000]   Faith flows from a heart that has been turned to love Christ
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.680]   and so embraces truth.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.440]   And so we who believe, it is not simply
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:23.040]   that we know certain things about Christ.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.240]   Our eyes have been opened, our hearts
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.520]   turned so that we find to our surprise
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.640]   that He is beautiful, delightful.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.760]   We desire fellowship with Him.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   We cherish Him, we adore Him.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.920]   And here's the danger with the knowledge of God
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.840]   that is purely cerebral.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.840]   It will puff us up as it puffed up the Pharisees.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.520]   And full of ourselves, we will even
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.680]   find ourselves looking down on those simpletons
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.360]   who love Jesus, but don't seem to know as much as we do.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:06.240]   That kind of knowledge is not a taste and appreciation
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:19.520]   for the glory of God, that proud, puffed up knowledge.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:26.400]   That is a lust for the glory of God.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.480]   It is a lust for the glory of men.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:40.400]   It is so easy for us to see the corruption in a sinner.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.480]   Take a sinner whose tastes have grown so perverted
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.560]   that they revel in moral filth.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.400]   And we can think, I'm not like that.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.440]   But if we are dead to the loveliness of Christ
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.520]   and we do not glory in Him.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:59.280]   If the glory of men stirs us more than the glory of God,
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   then, oh brothers, we are corrupted.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:08.720]   At the end of John's gospel, three times,
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:14.040]   Jesus asks Peter, do you love me?
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:22.560]   And so, my dear brothers, I must ask you, do you love Jesus?
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:32.440]   I am not asking, do you love ministry or study or preaching?
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.360]   Do you love Jesus?
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:42.240]   This is the life that God shares with us.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.760]   This is what God has always been about.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:54.160]   The Father has always enjoyed knowing and loving His Son.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.160]   That is what is most characteristic of Him for eternity.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.920]   And through the Spirit, the Father shares with us His highest pleasure.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:11.600]   He opens our eyes so that we know and love and enjoy His Son as He has always done.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:20.680]   And so, our love for the Son is an echo, an extension of the Father's love.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:31.360]   That is the very heart of Godlikeness.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:35.960]   It is the prime reason the Spirit is given.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:41.600]   And so, the Puritan John Owen wrote,
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:48.120]   "Therein consists the principal part of our renovation into the image of God.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:55.920]   Nothing makes us so like the Father as our love for Jesus Christ."
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.600]   When you love Jesus Christ, that's when you're being like the Father,
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:07.760]   who loves His Son and is well-pleased in Him.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:12.600]   And so, the Spirit not only opens our eyes to share the Father's love of the Son,
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.240]   He gives us the mind of Christ.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:18.600]   And so, the Son's love for the Father.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   And what is most characteristic about the Son is John 14, 31, "I love the Father."
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:38.840]   And so, the heart of our transformation into the likeness of the Son is our deep delight
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.560]   in the Father.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:46.360]   Jesus, when He's filled with the Spirit, says, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.160]   and earth."
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.720]   And so, in our love and enjoyment of the Son, we're being like the Father.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:58.200]   In our love and enjoyment of the Father, we're being like the Son.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:02.520]   This is eternal life.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:07.200]   This is why the Son glorified His Father.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:16.520]   We get to know God in that hour, "so that," John 17, 26, "the love with which you've loved
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:19.120]   Me may be in them and I in them."
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:27.920]   When God is glorified, life is given.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.200]   And this is why the glory of God is the genesis of mission.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:44.160]   When we glory in God, knowing, enjoying Him as He is, we have life.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:51.760]   Those who know their God shall find strength and life.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:59:08.160]   And when we glory in God, we will overflow with life and go out radiantly, like Him,
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:20.960]   in mission, participating in the work of the Spirit to make Jesus known in all the earth.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:29.840]   In contrast, if we do not glory in Christ, we will not proclaim Him to the ends of the
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.400]   earth.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.960]   And that's made very clear at the end of John chapter 12.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:48.400]   Would you come with me to John chapter 12, towards the end, verse 42.
[00:59:48.400 --> 01:00:05.280]   John 12, 42, "Many, even of the rulers, believed in Him.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:11.920]   But because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing Him, for fear that they would be
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.360]   put out of the synagogue."
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360]   So what's going on?
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.880]   They are not confessing Him.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.880]   Why?
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:28.440]   Verse 43, "They loved the glory of men rather than the glory of God."
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:34.840]   That was their root problem and the reason they would not confess Him.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:42.360]   They loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:50.700]   With their eyes on others, hungry for popularity and praise, they would not dare confess Christ
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.320]   or go against the crowd.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:00.360]   They're looking to scratch itching ears, because they want the applause.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.600]   And so instead, said Jesus, they do all their deeds to be noticed by men.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.880]   They broaden their phylacteries, they lengthen the tassels of their garments, they love the
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:16.720]   places of honor at the banquets and being called "rabbi."
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.280]   God was not sufficiently glorious in their eyes, and so they preferred the glory of little
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.440]   creatures.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:36.520]   Blind to the beauty of God, they became enslaved to the hamster wheel of people-pleasing.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:43.360]   Haven't we all been there?
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.200]   Enslaved to what people think of us.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:55.040]   And it wasn't about their theological orthodoxy or their biblical competence, it was all about
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:01.240]   what they loved.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:17.200]   Dear brothers, we will share and we will smell of what we truly glory in.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:27.120]   And the fact is, we think we can, you cannot hide what you really glory in for long.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.840]   It gives off a stink.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:40.000]   What you truly glory in will be an aroma about you.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:48.340]   And out of the overflow of your heart, whatever is in your heart, you will speak.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:58.700]   In my ministry as President of Union, we raise shepherds, church leaders, in church-based
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.140]   locations all around the world.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:11.080]   We do so that the church, the Bride of Christ, might be built up, that in all these locations
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.940]   around the world, we may deploy them out for the growth of the church and the spreading
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:20.340]   of Christ's glory worldwide.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:27.620]   And so, to do that, Union provides biblical education, pastoral training, theological
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:43.440]   resources, but underneath all of that, we seek to raise leaders who glory in God.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:53.020]   Who love the glory of God more than the glory of man, for no amount of education, training,
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:04:00.220]   or resources can make good one who loves the wrong glory.
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:13.220]   Now, of course, loving the glory of men more than the glory of God, it's an itch, a lust.
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:23.940]   We all feel, we all know it inside ourselves, and we see it everywhere around us.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:36.660]   So we must ask, please ask yourself, really, which is better, the glory of God or the glory
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.500]   of his creatures?
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:45.700]   Which is more life-giving?
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:56.180]   The glory of God is the only fountain of life, and we cannot depart from it if we are to
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:01.100]   have life or to give life.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:06.700]   The Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians had a very similar thought to John 17, when he says,
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:13.860]   "God, who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' is the one who has shone into our hearts to
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:20.740]   give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:29.300]   Now, what is on Paul's mind there is how, you remember Moses saw the glory of God on
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:40.620]   Mount Sinai, and then he came down from the mountain and he did not realize his skin shone,
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:48.340]   radiant because he had been speaking with God.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.640]   He shone.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:56.060]   That is glory.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:03.860]   And likewise, says Paul, "We all with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:10.740]   the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.460]   We're doing what Moses did.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:25.580]   We, like him, turned to the Lord, and beholding his glory, we, Psalm 34 verse 5, "They looked
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:29.320]   to him and were radiant."
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:37.620]   Those who look to him begin to shine with God's own light.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:45.020]   The sight of the glory of Christ is what makes the faces of the saints shine.
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:52.500]   It's what makes them come alive, whatever their circumstances, for the glory of God
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:57.340]   in the face of Christ is like a sun shining us on a winter morning.
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:06.420]   It's like the turn of winter into spring, a warming, life-giving light grows, making
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:09.660]   life blossom.
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:17.860]   The Puritan Richard Sibbes put it like this, he said, "The saints are like little birds
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:30.460]   shivering in the darkness of the night, quiet, cold, until the dawning light shines upon
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.460]   them.
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:40.780]   And then, in the light of God's goodness and glory, they begin to sing.
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:47.420]   Shine the light of the world on them, and warmed by him, glorying in him, they break
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:51.460]   forth in joy."
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:08:00.900]   Those who glory in God, who know him with an adoring enjoyment, brothers, they are the
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.660]   ones who become like him.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.780]   Those are the ones who become like God.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:11.020]   As he is radiant, those who look to him become radiant.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:21.500]   And they become like him, fruitful, life-giving, outgoing.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:33.300]   They begin to shine like stars in this present darkness, this crooked and depraved generation.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:39.020]   Look to him and be radiant.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:48.360]   Look to Daniel 12 verse 3, "Those who have insight will shine brightly, like the brightness
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:51.180]   of the expanse of heaven.
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:09:03.020]   And those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever."
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:11.700]   Brothers, it is by the shining of his glorious face that he gives life, that he spreads his
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:13.900]   blessedness.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:18.300]   So look to him if you would have life.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:26.020]   Know him with a knowledge that falls on its knees in adoration.
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:35.260]   It is those who know him and glory in him who are radiant with life.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:41.540]   And so, dear brothers, may the Lord bless you and keep you.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:49.100]   May the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:10:09.300]   May the Lord lift up his glorious face upon you and give you peace.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:22.780]   Thank you.
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:25.160]   What a feast.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.820]   Thank you, Michael.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:33.620]   Well, we've had a pretty good day so far, haven't we?
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:38.220]   And it just is going to get better and better and better.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:39.820]   I want to highlight a couple of books.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:47.660]   And since Michael was in John 17, I want to highlight a book, a new book by Pastor John
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.220]   MacArthur.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:56.340]   And it's called A Savior Who Prays, and it's an exposition of Christ's prayer in John 17.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:01.020]   Related to that, you can also visit John MacArthur Publishing Table on the patio.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:09.020]   You can get a free study guide for this book and other books also from JMPG Books, Our
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.540]   Savior Who Prays.
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:16.540]   And along that also same line, Stephen Charnock, who is the famous author of The Existence
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:22.620]   and Attributes of God, has a book that we have available, The Doctrine of Regeneration.
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.460]   The Doctrine of Regeneration.
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:32.240]   So just two books to highlight for you this afternoon as we move into dinner.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:37.420]   We have food trucks out there, which is a very big favorite here at Grace Church.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:42.860]   There's a variety of Southern California multicultural meals provided near us.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.380]   We have a Hawaiian barbecue.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.100]   We have a Los Angeles Greek cuisine.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.820]   We have a Thai-Mexican.
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.120]   We have Italian.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.580]   We have American fusion.
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:53.580]   There's so many.
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:58.400]   You can see them in your app for Shepherds Conference.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.340]   So go out there.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:04.660]   Find some that you can kind of limit tonight and then tomorrow night and Friday as well
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.060]   just to kind of try the different trucks.
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:12.780]   But more than anything else, just take a time to really contemplate what it is that we've
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:20.780]   just heard about the glory of God, the glory of Christ preceding just knowledge so beautifully
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.940]   done and so wonderfully heartwarming, my friend.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:24.940]   Thank you.
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.540]   Well, let me just pray for dinner and then you're dismissed.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:33.740]   Father God, thank you again for just the lessons that we are learning from your Word, lessons
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:39.160]   that are transcending all things that perhaps we had even contemplated before.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:46.280]   Our love for your glory, dear Jesus, our love for you is the source of all true knowledge.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.700]   And let that be a lesson to us today.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:54.280]   Let it be the source of our conversation and let it be the joy of our heart.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.380]   Bless the food that we're about to receive in Christ's name, amen.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:57.880]   Amen.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.380]   Amen.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:58.880]   Amen.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.380]   Amen.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:12:59.880]   Amen.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.380]   Amen.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:00.880]   Amen.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.380]   Amen.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:01.880]   Amen.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.380]   Amen.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:02.880]   Amen.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.380]   Amen.
