[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   I would like to call your attention this morning to the words found at the beginning of the
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:13.020]   fourteenth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians. The epistle to the
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:21.240]   Ephesians, chapter six, the first part of verse fourteen. Stand therefore, having your
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:32.080]   lines girt about with truth. We are considering the exhortation of the apostle here, where
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.520]   he tells us that as we are confronted by the wiles of the devil and have to wrestle not
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.120]   with flesh and blood but with principalities and powers and the rulers of the darkness
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.080]   of this world and even spiritual wickedness in high places, that there are only two things
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.960]   for us to do. He exhorts us to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. And
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.720]   then he tells us to put on the whole armor of God. And we are now looking at this second
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.140]   exhortation, putting on the whole armor of God. And here in the fourteenth verse he begins
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.420]   to give us his detailed instructions with respect to that armor. And the first thing
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.960]   is we've seen is that we are to have our lines girt about with truth. And having shown
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.280]   the importance of girting the lines, we are now trying to understand the meaning of the
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   exhortation that we should girt them about with truth. That's the practical question
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.160]   that is before us. If I'm told that I stand no chance at all in this fight against the
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.680]   devil and his powers, if I haven't got my lines girted about with truth, well then obviously
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.480]   the first and the most important thing for me is to discover what is truth. What's it
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.200]   mean? If I'm told to do this particular thing, well, I must be able to know what it
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.580]   is. But as I'm indicating, it is just here that the greatest confusion of all perhaps
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.300]   prevails at the present time in the Christian Church. We are dealing only with the Church.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.920]   The world is never told to put on the whole armor of God. Can't do so. Impossible, by
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.320]   definition. This is only to Christian people. And here is the great tragedy of the age,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.440]   that the Church is in utter confusion with regard to this primary matter. What is the
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.200]   truth? I must gird it on, otherwise I'm defeated already. But what is it? Is it possible
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.760]   to know what it is? Now that's the matter that's engaging us at this moment. In other
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.360]   words, if you like, the great problem is the problem of authority. What is our authority
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.080]   in these matters? Can the truth be known or not? If it can, what is it? Now I think that
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.520]   this should be obvious to all of us. If we are exalted to take this as the first piece
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.760]   of armor and gird our lines with it of everything, well then, surely by definition it follows
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.440]   that the truth is something that can be defined. And therefore any teaching that comes to us
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.320]   which tells us that it cannot be defined, that it's something vague and indefinite
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.760]   and some spirit which possesses people without their quite knowing what it is, not having
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:42.240]   any way of testing it, well, I say that by definition that must of necessity be wrong.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   And the whole biblical teaching, New Testament in particular, denounces any such attitude
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.600]   towards what it describes as truth. Well now then, we've seen in our endeavor to discover
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.920]   what this authority is, that there are certain things that we cannot turn to as authority
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.960]   and that is our own reason. We've seen the inadequacy of that, our own feelings, our
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.840]   experiences, subjective state. I'm not saying that these have no part in the Christian life.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.120]   All I'm saying is that they are not the authority. You don't build on them. They're
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.360]   not the foundation. They come in, but they're not in this foundational position. And in
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.960]   the same way, we ended last Sunday morning by saying that the church is not the authority
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.280]   either. And I don't care what church. I dealt in particular with the Roman Catholic
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.400]   Church because it makes this claim to authority more loudly perhaps than any other. And I
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.200]   did so also because of the obvious trend at the present time back to Rome. And there is
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.440]   no other way, no other possibility, if we begin to say that we can't define the truth.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.120]   If we say truth doesn't matter, well then the end of that road is Rome, obviously, and
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.000]   of necessity. Logic will take us there. So I dealt with that church in particular. But
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.560]   now then, having done that, I still ask the question, what then is our authority?
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.080]   Now surely we've reached this stage when we've seen the absolute necessity for some
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.720]   external, some objective authority. Not my reason, not my feelings, not the traditions
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.280]   of men, which again are nothing but the outcome of reason and feelings, what the Roman Catholic
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.580]   Church and all the churches that follow are called tradition. They're the traditions
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.720]   of men, as our Lord describes them in the New Testament. Now we see that we must have
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:46.280]   something external, something objective, something by which we can test our reason, our feelings,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:56.240]   and everything else. And once more I do not hesitate to assert that this is the most important
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.880]   question confronting every one of us at this moment.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.520]   What do you see when you look into the future? How do you explain the tendencies that are
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.640]   so obvious? Is it a matter of indifference to you that the whole church should go back
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:24.320]   to Rome? Is that nothing? Did the Reformers die in vain, or was the Reformation, as so
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.200]   many are saying today in Protestant circles, was the Reformation the greatest disaster
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.680]   in the history of the church? Now, I'm calling attention to these things because they are
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:44.640]   to me absolutely vital. And a day is coming when we'll have to face these things and
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.080]   take our decision and our choice with respect to them. Very well then, I say, there is nothing
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.840]   which is more important than this whole question of authority. I wonder whether you'll forgive
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:04.000]   me if in my attempt and endeavor to make this clear, I relate to you an experience, something
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.720]   that happened to me during this past week since last Sunday. It's not my custom to
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.280]   do this sort of thing, but something happened to me and I felt immediately that it was a
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.120]   very wonderful illustration of this very matter with which we are dealing. And I tell you
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.440]   this in order that I think you'll agree it does bring out the importance of this whole
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:35.200]   matter of authority. I was seated in a train traveling in the direction of South End last
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.800]   Tuesday afternoon and reading, when suddenly I became aware of a kind of commotion in the
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:50.240]   compartment, one of these open compartments. And I began to look, and there I saw people
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.600]   standing around a man who was obviously in some kind of trouble, so I approached. And
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:05.840]   there I saw a poor man having an epileptic fit, struggling, bluish-red in color, frothing
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   at the mouth and so on. And I soon realized that these good people who were standing around
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.240]   him and who had been paying attention to him while I was still reading had arrived at a
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.120]   decision. They said that there was only one thing to do and that was to stop the train
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.480]   at the next station. And one of them knew that there was a hospital up the road not
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.120]   far from the station and that they'd have to get an ambulance and so on and put him
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.400]   there. Their idea was that the man had had a stroke or that he was having a very serious
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.280]   heart attack and that he was on the verge of death. And because they took this view,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.240]   they very rightly and naturally were proposing to make all these arrangements.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.920]   Well then, it was at that point I had to arrive at my decision. What should I do? Because
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.960]   it was quite clear to me that this man was not in any danger at all as regards his life.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.760]   He was suffering from an epileptic fit, which he'd probably had many times before. And
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.000]   I knew that the man, when he came round, would be very annoyed if he found himself in a hospital
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.240]   and all this fuss had been made with respect to him. So I decided that in the interests
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:21.760]   of the man I would intervene. But then I had a second decision to make. Should I tell them
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:29.080]   that as it happened, by accident, I did happen to know just a little bit about these things?
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:36.040]   Or should I not tell them that? Well, not desiring to be involved in a delay which would
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.480]   make me late for my preaching engagement that afternoon, I decided that I wouldn't give
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.400]   them any indication as to who or what I was. But I just said to them very firmly, I said,
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.680]   "No, no, you mustn't do this. It's quite unnecessary. This man is suffering from an
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.600]   epileptic fit. It's an attack. He'll be quite all right in a short time and he'll be very
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.160]   annoyed if you put him into hospital." I said, "There's no danger whatsoever."
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.600]   They looked at me with considerable doubt and hesitation, but I could see that I was
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.520]   making an impression, so I persisted. And after a little while, I was able to persuade
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.920]   them. Some of them were still doubtful, I could see, and really didn't quite believe,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.880]   but I was able to persuade them not to do anything at all. I assured them that the men
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:30.200]   would soon regain consciousness, which of course he did, and eventually left the train
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.960]   at South End as I'd anticipated he would. Now the point I want to make is this, and
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.280]   this is my only reason for telling you of such an incident. You see how the question
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   of authority came in there. Here were a number of people. We were all strangers to one another.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:53.840]   Here were people who were deciding to do something. I alone, and I was alone in my view, they
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.580]   were all agreed about what they were going to do. I alone was able to persuade them not
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:08.360]   to do it. How did I succeed? Well, I succeeded because I spoke with authority. They detected
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:14.000]   in what I was saying a note of authority. They didn't know, was it a hemorrhage in
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.160]   the brain, was it a heart attack, what was it? They were all agreed that he was dying,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.440]   that it was desperate, but they didn't know what it was. But suddenly somebody speaks
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.800]   with authority and says, "It's all right, you needn't do that. You don't stop the
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.480]   train, you don't send for an ambulance, you don't take him to hospital. He's going
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.600]   to be all right." And they listened to me. They accepted my opinion and they acted upon
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:41.160]   it. Yes, but you see the significant thing is this. They didn't know the basis of my
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:48.240]   authority. I hadn't told them on what grounds I was able to speak in this dogmatic and certain
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.680]   and authoritative manner. They didn't know that. But in spite of not knowing that, they
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.360]   listened to me. They changed their opinion and they acted upon my advice. Now there,
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.960]   you see, is the parable. That's a perfect portrayal, it seems to me, of the case of
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:14.240]   so many today in the Church, and then of necessity, the case of those that are outside the Church.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.440]   The people are bewildered. We're in an alarming situation. What's going to happen?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:27.440]   What should we do? And they don't know. So they're fumbling. But then suddenly they
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:35.000]   hear a word of authority, and they're ready to listen to it. Now, the point that comes
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.360]   out, it seems to me, is this. That without knowing the basis of the authority, they're
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:46.680]   ready to listen to an authoritative statement. Now, isn't that the very thing that's happening?
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.840]   That's why the cults are succeeding today. That's why certain freak religious movements
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:59.000]   are succeeding today. They speak with authority, they speak with certainty. Whereas the Christian
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.600]   Church as a whole is fumbling and hesitant and doubtful, and says it doesn't know what
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.880]   the truth is, and some even say that you can't tell what it is. It's something that's caught,
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.900]   not taught, and so on. And here we are. And the people in their bewilderment, when they
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:16.360]   hear a word of authority, something spoken definitely, they believe it, they accept it,
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.240]   they act upon it, but they don't know the basis of the authority.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:31.160]   Now then, I was able to speak as I did to those people because I had authority. It wasn't
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:38.200]   an opinion, it wasn't just a feeling that I had. I was speaking on the basis of knowledge.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:44.800]   I'd got knowledge, I'd got facts. I wasn't making what the doctors sometimes call a spot
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   diagnosis. The thing was perfectly simple, it was quite plain, it was textbook. There
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:57.320]   was no question about it at all. Knowledge, information, truth. And I was able to speak
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:04.040]   as I did. And what I said was verified because it was based upon and established upon facts
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:11.200]   and upon a knowledge of truth. Now there, I think, is a perfect picture of
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.440]   the whole situation by which we are confronted at the present time. What is needed is not
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.400]   merely a note of authority, but it is the authority which leads to the authoritative
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.300]   statement. There are plenty of people in the world who are ready to get up and make dogmatic
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.680]   pronouncements and speak with a great certainty and assurance, born of nothing but their own
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:41.560]   self-confidence and sometimes of their delusions. And that is where the whole danger comes in.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.680]   People are ready to listen to this, as these people listened to me in the train without
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.400]   knowing the basis of my authority. I was glad they did, and yet at the same time there was
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.440]   something pathetic to me about it. It shows this terrible danger. But it leads to this
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:03.240]   ultimate position, which is that it is essential that we should have some authority, authority
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:10.640]   which is based upon knowledge. Now then, it is at this point we come to the
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:20.400]   only authority that can answer these desiderata, and that is, of course, the Bible, this book
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:27.760]   from which we preach. There can be no doubt at all. This seems to me to be so plain that
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.400]   there cannot be any discussion about it, that all the troubles in the Church today and most
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:41.680]   of the troubles in the world by consequence are due to a departure from the authority
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:48.840]   of this book. And therealess, it was the Church herself that led that particular movement.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.980]   You are familiar with the history, most of you? The so-called higher criticism that came
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.820]   in from Germany just over a hundred years ago, which just means that you put philosophy
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.160]   in the place of revelation, that men's opinions, and you talk about the advance of knowledge
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.920]   and science, and then this becomes just a book like any other book, out of date in some
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.240]   respects, wrong in other respects, and so on, and no longer a book on which you can
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.280]   rely. Now there is no question whatsoever that the
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.880]   falling away even from Church attendance in this country is the direct consequence of
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.800]   that. The man in the street says, "But what do they know? It's only their opinion. They're
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.040]   just going on with something that the real thinkers and scientists have long since seen
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.080]   through and have dropped." That's the attitude of the men in the street, and he doesn't listen.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:42.520]   He's not interested at all. The whole situation is one of drift. And very largely, I say,
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:48.560]   it is the direct and immediate outcome of the doubt that has been cast by the Church
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:58.000]   herself upon her own authority. Men's opinions have taken the place of God's truth.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.400]   Very well then, I say, there is the whole trouble today, and the people you see in their
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.000]   need are listening to the cults. They're listening to any false authority that offers itself
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:16.040]   to them. So that we come to this as our ultimate and final question. Do we accept this as the
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:24.640]   Word of God and as the sole authority in all matters of faith and practice and conscience,
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:32.520]   or do we not? Is the whole of my thinking governed by this? Or do I come with my thinking
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.340]   and pick and choose out of this and sit in judgment upon it, putting myself as the ultimate
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:45.480]   standard and authority? It's one or the other. Do I accept this as a revelation from
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:53.400]   God, or do I trust to speculation, human knowledge, human learning, human understanding, and human
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:18:00.920]   reason? Which is it? Or, putting it still more simply, do I pin my faith to and subject
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:10.600]   all my thinking to what I read here, or else modern knowledge, modern learning, what people
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.560]   think today, what we know at this present time, and which wasn't known in the past?
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.480]   No, it's inevitably one or the other of those two.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.760]   Now I need scarcely remind you, and yet, unless we are living in days when one does have to
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:34.160]   remind people of this, the Protestant position, as well as the position of the early Church
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:43.640]   in the first centuries, is that the Bible is the Word of God, not that it contains it,
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:53.200]   but that it is the Word of God, uniquely inspired, in error, not only containing the revelation
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:00.680]   of God's truth to men, but God having safeguarded the truth by dealing with the men who wrote
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.960]   it by the Holy Spirit, and keeping them from error, and from blemishes, and from anything
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.360]   that was wrong. Now that is the traditional Protestant position.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.600]   And it seems to me that the moment we abandon that, we've already started on the road
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:23.240]   that leads back to one of the false authorities, and probably Rome itself. It's the only
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.120]   alternative in the last analysis. People will have authority, and they're right there.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.240]   We need authority because we're all bewildered, and if they don't get it in the right way,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.960]   they'll take it in the wrong way. They will listen to it. They can be persuaded, even
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.760]   though they don't know the source of the authority. In their utter bewilderment, they're
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.520]   ready to be persuaded by any authority to state it.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:51.920]   So that it comes back to this. You see, we are back exactly where they were 400 years
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.560]   ago. The world talks about its events, its cycles. We are going round in the cycle. We
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.760]   are back exactly where they were 400 years ago. We are having to fight once more the
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:10.480]   whole battle of the Protestant Reformation. It is either this book, or else it is ultimately
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:17.200]   the authority of the Church of Rome. Tradition, men's tradition, more important than the
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.960]   Word of God. That was the great issue at the Protestant
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.000]   Reformation. It was because of what they found here that those men stood up against, and
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.960]   queried and questioned, and finally condemned the Church of Rome. It was that alone that
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.680]   enabled Luther to stand, just one man, defying all these 15 centuries of tradition.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.360]   "I can do no other," he says. "Why?" "Well, because of what he's found here."
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.800]   He could see that they were wrong. It doesn't matter that he was alone. It doesn't matter
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.960]   that all the big battalions were there. What's it matter? He had the authority of the Word
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:55.240]   of God, and he judged the Church and her tradition and everything by this external authority.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:01.480]   Well, now we are back again in that exact position. And I am concerned about this, as
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.840]   I say, not only from the standpoint of the Church in general, but also from the standpoint
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:14.440]   of our own individual experiences. How can we fight the devil? How can we know how we
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.400]   are to live? How can we answer the things we hear, the things we read, and all the subtle
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.000]   suggestions of the devil? How can we? Where can I get this truth that I must gird on as
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.320]   I put on all this armor of God? Where can I find it unless I find it here? I'm left
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   in a subjective position of sand that gives way beneath my feet, and I don't know where
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:42.000]   I am, or else I stand on what Mr. Gladstone called "the impregnable rock of Holy Scripture."
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.120]   Well, now then, why should we do this? Why should we believe this? Well, there are many
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:54.200]   answers to this. I almost apologize for reminding you of them. But when I find that Christian,
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:00.000]   Protestant, evangelical people are so vague about this and say, "Yes, we listened to
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.240]   us on the television, some cardinal, or Roman Catholic archbishop, and he seemed a very
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.960]   nice man and a very reasonable man." Well, I'm driven back to see that the next step
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   will be they'll listen to him, and they'll go after him. And it's obvious to me that
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.040]   they don't know the truth about their own authority. They're not aware of the position,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.720]   not only not aware of the dangers, but unaware of the rock which should be beneath their
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.640]   feet. We shouldn't be children, carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the cunning
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:37.920]   craftiness and slight of men, and the only way to avoid that is to have a compass, is
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.960]   to have a chart, is to have an authority, is to have something solid on which you can
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.480]   base your everything, and if necessary, sacrifice your life for it.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   Well, now then, I ask, why should we hold this Protestant, reformed position? Well,
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:01.240]   the answer is that the Bible itself claims that it is this. That's the very claim that
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:07.840]   the Bible makes for itself everywhere. It does so sometimes explicitly, it does so implicitly,
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:13.120]   everywhere. What do I mean? Well, I mean something like this. I'm trying to reduce all this,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.960]   which could of course engage us for a very long time. I'm not proposing to do so. I
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.120]   want to give you the essence of the argument, and I plead with you to read everything you
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   can find that will re-establish your utter, absolute confidence in the Bible as the Word
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.820]   of God.
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:33.820]   But here is an argument. Here's the fundamental argument, it always seems to me, that by definition,
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:43.880]   no man in and of himself can ever arrive at a knowledge of God. Now, there is the plank,
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:50.120]   the basic plank on which the whole superstructure must be erected. Now, that is of course the
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:56.400]   whole basis of the New Testament teaching. It was the whole basis of the apostolic teaching.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:02.520]   What I simply cannot understand is how anybody can hold that other view who's ever read what
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.160]   we read together at the beginning this morning, those portions out of Paul's first epistle
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.560]   to the Corinthians, both in chapter 1 from verse 17 to the end, and also in chapter 2.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:19.560]   Now the apostle, you see, puts it down like this. Here is the fundamental position. "For
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:25.960]   the preaching of the cross," he says, "is to them that perish foolishness. But unto
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.640]   us which are saved it is the power of God." Now then, "For it is written," he's quoting
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   from the Old Testament, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:46.400]   the understanding of the prudent." That's it. Where is the wise? He's challenging.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.440]   Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? The man who relies on modern
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.480]   knowledge and science and learning and his own ability and what the philosophers are
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:02.720]   saying, where is the disputer of this world? Then, "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   of this world?" How? Well, in this way. "For after that in the wisdom of God, the world
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:15.040]   by wisdom, by philosophy, by learning, by knowledge and understanding and all the rest
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:22.040]   of it, the world by wisdom knew not God. It had failed to find Him. And when it had failed,
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.760]   it then pleased God by the foolishness of preaching, by the foolishness of the thing
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.160]   preached, by the foolishness of the gospel and the message of the gospel, to save them
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.360]   that believe." Now, there it is, and that is the whole position, and there is no answer
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:45.040]   to it. You see, this is where you see the wisdom of God. People often ask this question.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.960]   If God had proposed to send the Messiah, the Deliverer, his own Son, into this world, as
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:55.880]   he had, and as he prophesied and foretold throughout the running centuries, why did
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:02.880]   he wait so long to do it? Why didn't he do it much earlier? Well, here is the answer.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:10.280]   God sent his Son into the world with his message after he had given the world a full opportunity
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:19.120]   to deliver itself, and particularly through Greek philosophy. You see, all those great
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.600]   Greek philosophers—Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, and the rest—they had all lived and they
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.200]   had all taught before the Lord Jesus Christ came. Here was man that is very acme. There
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:35.840]   is no question about that. There is no question at all but that the flowering period of the
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:42.520]   human intellect in so many senses was reached in that great era of Greek philosophy which
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:49.040]   preceded the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, it was given a full opportunity. There
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   is man's ability and thinking at its very best and highest, but it did not come anywhere
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   nearer knowledge of God. The world, by wisdom, knew not God, and it never has known him ever
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:10.920]   since and it never will. That is it. And yet you see today that is what they are holding
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.560]   on to. The Church is doing that. The Church is quoting the philosophers, finding insights
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.680]   in these different religions and in the philosophers' teaching. Whether they are Christian or not,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.200]   it does not matter. If they are able men and are learned and can think, "Ah, they have
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:29.960]   got something to tell us," it is a complete denial of the whole basis of apostolic preaching.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God. Why not? Well, isn't it obvious? How could it? Why?
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:44.600]   Well, for this reason. Because of the character of God. Isn't it obvious?
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.880]   You see, the princes of this world did not know him, did not recognize our Lord. We preach
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.960]   wisdom, says Paul, among them that are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of this world or of the
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.680]   princes of this world that come to naught. Now, this human wisdom, even in its princes,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.440]   its greatest men, is inadequate. It will never get us to the truth. Why? Well, the thing
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:11.440]   is so elementary, it seems to me. It is because God is what God is. And what is God? Well,
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:19.280]   God is infinite and absolute and eternal in every respect. God is. And the moment you
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:29.240]   realize that truth, how can men possibly arrive at a knowledge of him? I would have thought
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:37.200]   that even your philosophy ought to prove that. How can the finite encompass the infinite?
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   How can mortal men arrive at a real knowledge of the immortal God? The God who says, "I
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:52.720]   am that I am from eternity to eternity." Absolute in every respect. The God who is
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:29:00.240]   light and in whom is no darkness at all. That's enough. Even if men were perfect, he could
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.240]   not arrive at a knowledge of God. He's too small. If you are to encompass any knowledge
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.920]   with your brain, it means that your brain is greater than the thing that you encompass.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.960]   So when man wants to understand God and find him by his own searching and power and intellect
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.480]   and understanding, he's postulating that he's bigger than God, and God is someone
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   whom he can examine. The thing is monstrously ridiculous. But when I add to that, that man
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:36.120]   is not only finite but also sinful and fallen and unpleasant, and ungodly, and ungodly
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:43.120]   and unclean, and twisted and perverted, the thing becomes ridiculously impossible.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:52.640]   Take the apostle's argument. What man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:59.200]   that is in him. It must be a correspondence. If you want to appreciate music, you must
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.320]   have some music in you. There are people who have no appreciation of music at all. They
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.560]   may be great intellects, but they're tone-deaf. They have no appreciation. You see, there
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.760]   must be a correspondence before they can be understanding. And it's the same in the spiritual
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   realm. God is not only infinite and absolute and eternal. God, as I say, is light, and
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:28.560]   in him is no darkness at all. There's no community between light and darkness. There's
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:35.560]   no correspondence between black and white. God is everlastingly holy, and every one of
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:43.040]   us is sinful and unworthy and vile. And the result is, as the apostle says, that to every
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   such natural person, these things are foolishness. He not only can't arrive at the knowledge,
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.960]   when he's given the knowledge, he rejects it with scorn. It's nonsense to him. It's
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.560]   foolishness. The Greeks seek after wisdom, and this is foolishness. Of course. It's utterly
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.440]   different from what they believe and what they are and what they have, and it will be
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.560]   so throughout eternity. The passing of the ages makes no difference. God doesn't change.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:14.120]   Man doesn't change. Sin doesn't change. And therefore, whatever we may know today scientifically,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:18.560]   which our forefathers didn't know, it doesn't make the slightest difference to this matter.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:25.560]   So we are back again in the old position. The world, by wisdom, knew not God. It couldn't
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:32.320]   know. It was impossible. The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:38.320]   can he. That's the thing. He can't. It's impossible, because of the greatness of God
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   and his own weakness and inability and sinfulness. Very well. That puts us in this position.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.880]   And we, by all our efforts, can never arrive at this knowledge of God. Well, then, is knowledge
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:58.480]   possible? If I'm to gird my loins about with truth, how can I find it? How can I obtain
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.920]   this? Where can I find it? Well, there's only one answer. If we are to have any knowledge
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.700]   of truth at all, well, then God has got to give it us. It's got to be revealed to us.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:14.700]   We can't get there. We can't climb that mountain and reach the top where God is. Impossible.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:21.200]   But God, if he so chooses, can give us the knowledge which we desire. And the whole message
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   of the Bible, from beginning to end, is just that. That's exactly what God has done.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:36.520]   In the wisdom of God, when the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.360]   of preaching, by the message which he sent out through his servants to save them that
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.280]   believe. There it is. That's another way of putting revelation. Or take the way in which
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:49.560]   this great apostle puts it when he was preaching at Athens. There he is, addressing Stoics
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   and Epicureans. It is to me, not only the tragedy of tragedies, but the most inexplicable
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:02.720]   thing of all, how the Christian Church in the last century has deliberately brought
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:09.040]   philosophy back into the Church and put it in a central position, a complete denial of
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:16.040]   the whole of the gospel. And it's still doing it. I say it is monstrous for this very reason
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:25.600]   that we are considering. That we are obviously shut in in our utter inability. And we must
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:34.480]   stand before the world and say what Paul said there at Athens, "Whom ye ignorantly worship."
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   They were trying to find him still. They had not only got temples to all their various
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.200]   gods, but there was this strange temple with this inscription, "To the unknown God."
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   They had a feeling that he was there somewhere. It's in everybody. The most primitive races
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   have got a belief in some supreme God. They don't know him. They're trying to find out.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.360]   And so were the Greeks. "The unknown God." And Paul looks at them and says, "Whom you
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   are ignorantly worshipping or trying to worship, him declare I unto you." He's making a big
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:11.560]   declaration. Here are the people fumbling. What shall we do? And then comes a man with
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:18.560]   authority and says, "Him declare I unto you." Here's knowledge. Here's the information.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:25.000]   That's revelation. And that is the whole biblical position.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.280]   In our inability, in our finite condition, and in our sinfulness, we cannot, we never
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.960]   shall be able to arrive at a knowledge of God. And we are shut up to this position that
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.840]   if God doesn't please to give us a knowledge, to give us revelation, we have nothing, we
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.360]   are undone, we are hopeless, there is no truth. But, says the Bible, God has done this very
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.680]   thing. That's the whole glory of the message. That is the good news of the gospel of salvation.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:56.680]   God has been pleased to give us this revelation. Now that is the whole message of the Bible.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:01.120]   Apart from the details which it gives us, that is what it's proclaiming from beginning
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.880]   to end. In the beginning, God, it's an authoritative statement. How does Moses make the authoritative
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.360]   statement? It was given to him. So that you find the author of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:15.440]   saying that it is by faith that we know how the world was created at the beginning. That's
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:21.240]   how we know it, by faith. It was given. It's a revelation. And so on. Well, let me hurry
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   you through it in this way. That is the claim, you see, of the Old Testament.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.840]   And the Old Testament in this matter is as important as the new. The two go together.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:41.840]   The one leads to the other. That was the whole basis on which Moses wrote his five books.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:49.900]   Not his own wisdom, not his own philosophy, not his own idea and understanding. No, no,
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:56.600]   the truth was revealed to him and he was enabled by the Spirit to write it. Then you come to
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:02.800]   your prophets, exactly the same. Not a single prophet ever stood up and said, "I am saying
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.280]   this because I've thought a lot about this and I've meditated a lot about it and I've
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.400]   come to this conclusion." That isn't the way they put it. They say, "The burden of
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:16.160]   the Lord, the message of the Lord came unto me, or the Spirit of God came upon me." Every
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.520]   one of them. Some of them didn't want to give it. A man like Jeremiah says, "I wish
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.480]   I hadn't got to speak. I only get into trouble when I do speak." He decided more than once
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.280]   he'd never speak again, but he said, "The Word of God was like a fire burning within
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   me and I couldn't refrain." That's their position. The psalmist says the same thing.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.000]   What is this? Well, this is God disturbing men by the Spirit, giving them the message
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.520]   and then enabling them to deliver it in speech or in writing. That's the claim which all
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.720]   these prophets make. And do you remember how the apostles writing in the New Testament
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:53.240]   about these very things? That's exactly how they put it. You remember the famous statement
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:58.800]   of the apostle Paul to Timothy in 2 Timothy 3.16? "All Scripture," he says, and he's
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:05.280]   referring to the Old Testament, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God. It's God-breathed.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.400]   All of it is God-breathed. It's come from God. He's breathed it into men. It isn't
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.280]   man. It isn't human literature. It's God-breathed. And it's profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.600]   for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:25.680]   furnished unto all good works." Yes, that's the girdle you put around your lines, this
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:31.340]   very thing. Listen to Peter confirming the very statement, putting it in his own language,
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:36.800]   in that most important statement of his in the second epistle, chapter 1, verses 19 to
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.960]   the end. "We have also, Moshe, a word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.320]   heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place." That's where we are in the dark
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.920]   place today, but there's a light shining, "until the day dawn, and the day star arise
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:57.960]   in your hearts." Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:03.600]   interpretation, which doesn't mean that you and I can't interpret it as we read it.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:10.080]   That isn't what it means. No prophecy of Scripture is the result of any private human
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:16.400]   excogitation. It is not the result, he says, of human reason and thinking and understanding.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   It's not of any private interpretation. The prophetic insight was not a man's own private
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.320]   interpretation of contemporary events in an attempt to forecast the future. It isn't
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:33.520]   that. What is it then? Well, he says, prophecy came not in old time by the will of man. Never.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:41.560]   Well, how then? Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, carried along
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:47.920]   by, born along by the power of the Spirit. Now the thing is so abundantly plain and clear.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.400]   That is the statement, the claim made in the old, there it is stated explicitly in the
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:58.080]   new, but over and above. The testimony of the Apostle Paul and the Apostle Peter to
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:05.920]   the Old Testament writings. We've got our Lord's own attestation of it. Read your four
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:13.160]   Gospels. Notice how he quotes it. Notice how he always quotes it as the final authority.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:21.680]   Notice that he says on one occasion, "The Scriptures cannot be broken." You'll find
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:29.440]   that in the tenth chapter of John's Gospel. "The Scriptures cannot be broken." Watch
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:36.520]   his quotations, always authoritative. Quotes from Genesis as well as the other books. Talks
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.880]   about men at the beginning, obviously accepting the teaching about Adam and about Eve and
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:50.920]   the first marriage and so on. Our Lord believed the Old Testament to be the Word of God. There's
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   never any query, there's never any question about that at all, anywhere in the whole of
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:04.600]   his teaching. He rather accepts it all. And you remember how after the resurrection, he
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:12.240]   talks to the two men on the road to Emmaus, who'd lost their faith and were hopeless,
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:21.720]   "Oh fools," he says, "and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken."
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:29.360]   And so he began to take them through the Scriptures, Moses and the prophets. He showed them in
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:35.240]   the Scriptures the things concerning himself. He'd already said it many times. He said,
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:41.520]   "They speak of me." That's what he says about the Scriptures. And then you remember,
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.920]   back in Jerusalem again, when these two men from Emmaus had arrived back, there's the
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:50.440]   entire company assembled, and there they are still, somewhat bewildered and unhappy and
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.960]   not able to understand exactly what is taking place. This is what I read. "And he said
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:01.880]   unto them," Luke 24, 44, "These are the words which I speak unto you, while I was
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:08.720]   yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:16.200]   in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me." He teaches plainly the authority of
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:22.320]   the Old Testament. He preaches prophecy as foretelling, and foretelling accurately.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:28.160]   The knowledge can only have come from God and has been recorded by God's servants.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:33.560]   Then opened he their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures. Now there
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:41.120]   you are. There's your Old Testament. And then you see you come to the New Testament,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:46.960]   and you've got the same thing but only more so. There's the towering figure of our Lord
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:54.520]   himself and what he says about himself, what he claims for his teaching. He doesn't hesitate
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.720]   to speak with authority, and the people recognized it. They said, "This man speaketh with authority,
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   not as the Pharisees and scribes," and he did. "I say unto you, this carpenter,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.080]   this man who'd come from nowhere, this man who'd never been trained in the schools
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:16.240]   of the Pharisees, he stands and he speaks with authority. I'm telling you he claims
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:23.080]   to be the Son of God. He's not a human teacher, he's come from God. He's the Son of Man
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:30.360]   who comes from heaven and who is still in heaven. Before Abram was I Am, he says. That's
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:37.520]   his note everywhere. He commands them to listen because of the unique authority that belongs
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:44.720]   to his person and therefore to his teaching. How anybody can read the Scriptures without
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.880]   seeing that, "Persis me comprehension, it would indeed were it not that I know how sin
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:55.600]   blinds and how sin fills us with such prejudices that we don't know." And the tragedy today
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.160]   is that people are sitting in judgment not only on the Scriptures but also on the Lord
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.600]   of the Scriptures. You see, you're put into this position that you say that he was wrong
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.520]   in his belief in the Old Testament, and they don't hesitate to say that, that he was
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:13.120]   a child of his age, that he was wrong in certain claims he made for himself. They don't hesitate
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.520]   to say that. Well, if that's your position, you have no authority, you'll never have
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.960]   any. The only authority I have is this, that here is one who is the Son of God and has
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.720]   come out of the eternal bosom. He was with God. He's looked into the face of God and
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:31.360]   he's come on earth and he has revealed God. No man has seen God at any time. The only
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:38.200]   begotten who is in the bosom of the Father, he has revealed him.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.920]   What do we know apart from this revelation? Well, my friends, I must leave it at that
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:49.360]   for this morning. But this is the beginning of this matter. Here's the foundation. Here
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:58.400]   is the bare minimum, the utter absolute as I'm trying to describe it. We all of us
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:08.960]   either take everything from this or we've no authority at all. You either submit completely
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:16.840]   to it or else one man's opinion is as good as another. And that means that you've no
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:24.720]   authority at all. Before you can ever succeed in guiding your lines about with truth, you've
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.200]   got to come to this as a little child or, to use the stronger word that Paul uses, you've
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:34.600]   got to come to it as a fool. If any man willeth to be wise in this world, he says, let him
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.600]   become a fool, which means this, let him say he knows nothing. Let him say that philosophies
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.640]   of no value to him. Let him agree that the world by wisdom did not and cannot know God
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:48.120]   and that therefore he knows nothing. And he bends his knees and looks up and receives
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:58.520]   the revelation. That's it. In other words, if we are to guard about our lines with truth,
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:04.560]   we've not only got to admit that we know nothing and that we are completely ignorant,
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.120]   but we've got to admit further that before the Holy Spirit works upon us and gives us
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:18.560]   enlightenment we cannot even receive God's revelation. The natural man cannot, but God
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:24.280]   hath revealed unto us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.320]   things of God. If you want to be guard about with truth, you've got to come as a little
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:33.720]   child, acknowledging not only your weakness and insufficiency and inability and complete
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:40.080]   impotence, you've got to realize that the Spirit of God must work upon you and enlighten
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:46.560]   you and cleanse your understanding and give you an anointing before you can receive the
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:56.000]   revelation that God has graciously been pleased to give us. Here is the authority, God's revelation,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.320]   which we can obtain and understand as the result of the working of the Holy Spirit of
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:12.680]   God within us and upon us. Let's leave it at that for this morning. Where are you, my
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:18.040]   friend? Do you know where you are? What are you fighting with? How do you face the future?
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.760]   How do you deal with temptation and the devil and all the uncertainty of life? Here's the
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:36.600]   only answer. May God give us grace and strength to have our lines girt about with the truth.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.560]   Amen.
