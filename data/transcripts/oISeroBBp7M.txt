[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Well, young couples face a lot of questions.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.360]   Can they use birth control?
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.560]   Should they?
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.720]   Can the wife be the breadwinner in this season and should she?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.960]   Questions like these are faced by young couples in the transition years of finishing up school
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.840]   and launching into careers.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.560]   And the email we get today is from a young man who writes this, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.800]   I'm a junior in my undergraduate work with plans to attend medical school when I graduate.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.280]   My girlfriend and I have been dating for about five months and are strongly considering marriage.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.480]   We have the support of our church community, have preserved our physical purity, and are
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.540]   both maturing Christians.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.540]   With medical school, I will not be able to support a family for at least four years if
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.140]   my girlfriend and I were to get married."
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.160]   My two questions for you are these.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.220]   One, is it pleasing to God for a young couple in our situation to use birth control?
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.240]   Number two, would it be wrong to get married knowing that my girlfriend feels her main
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.760]   calling is to be a wife and a mom and she will not be able to do this for at least four
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.660]   years of my medical schooling?
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.080]   What advice would you give to a young couple in our situation?
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.380]   Well, I would be a hypocrite if I didn't tell you our story and then either regret
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.840]   it and ask you to do something different or affirm it and commend it to you for biblical
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   reasons.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.840]   So here we go.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:35.000]   First, I want to give praise to God that you have a strong church community, that it matters
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.600]   to you what they think about your relationship, that you have preserved your sexual purity.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.200]   What a great evidence of God's grace and power in your life.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.880]   Makes my heart sing.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.320]   So Noelle and I started on a similar footing of sovereign grace.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.760]   We were married soon after college, and I was at the front end at that moment of six
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.960]   more years of school, graduate school.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.640]   Three years in seminary, three years of doctoral work.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:19.680]   Noelle had no career aspirations except to stand by me, partner with me in God's calling
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.240]   on my life.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.080]   She wanted to have children, make a home for them, make a home for me, join me in whatever
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.320]   dimensions of our ministry that were suitable to her gifts.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.440]   So it sounds similar.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:42.200]   As we talked this over and sought the wisdom of Scripture, it seemed to us that for a while
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.520]   it would be good for God's long-term purposes in our lives if we postponed having children.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:57.400]   So we took steps to avoid pregnancy, I hope, without any abortifacients.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.760]   And the reason I say I hope is because I was so ignorant in the late '60s and early '70s.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.520]   I was so ignorant, so naive in those days that we may not have taken all the necessary
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:21.080]   precautions that we should have to make sure the way we were avoiding conception was in
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.280]   fact a non-abortion.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.080]   And I tremble at what we may have unknowingly done, but nobody needs to make that mistake
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.740]   in ignorance today.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.600]   But that was a fact.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.640]   Now similarly, we talked it over and sought the wisdom of Scripture about Noel being the
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.400]   main breadwinner for a season.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   It seemed to us fitting that she would be our main support financially for a while,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.120]   with me providing some income with a teaching assistantship.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:11.560]   Salaries were about $10 a week, and our little back house in Pasadena cost $75 a month, and
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.320]   we liked it.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.100]   And we just got by.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.760]   We had no savings, and we had almost no debt.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.720]   I say almost because there was a little point about $1,500 that at the end of a semester
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.560]   I went ahead and took out a student loan, which I paid back by cutting it in half by
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.280]   this special deal that they had.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.400]   If you teach for five years, you lose—you give away half your money.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   Anyway, I don't want to say no debt, almost no debt.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.840]   Then we headed off to graduate school in Germany, and even though Noel got a job at the European
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.560]   Exchange, she had worked now for three years, right?
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.280]   She was our main breadwinner all through seminary.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.440]   And we both were beginning to feel now into our fourth year of marriage that postponing
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.880]   children any longer was just undesirable.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   We wanted children.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.920]   You couldn't imagine waiting six years, right?
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.040]   That just seemed not good.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:17.000]   So we dispensed with the contraception and bang, pregnant, immediately.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.440]   We had no clear plan.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.400]   Whether you want to consider this wise or not, I would do it again.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.160]   We had no clear plan for how to support ourselves or pay for school, and you might think that
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.360]   that was just foolhardy, but there come points in your life—and I want to be careful with
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.960]   this, I don't say it's normative and you always have to act this way—but there come
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:48.000]   points in your life where you think the risk is worth it, and it seems God-ordained.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.380]   You don't claim any infallibility, it just seems right.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.760]   And we only knew that it seemed right at that point to move ahead with a family.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:06.000]   Seven months into her pregnancy, Noelle resigned her job, and she has never worked outside
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.600]   the home in a regular job since for the last 46 years at her own choosing.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.680]   Now, we didn't know what we would do financially.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:28.000]   So we prayed earnestly for wisdom and for provision, and the phone rang one afternoon,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.920]   and Professor Goeppelt said, "Herr Pieper," they called me Pieper, "Herr Pieper, a student
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.400]   from Africa had a stipend from the Bavarian Landeskirche, the state church, and he's
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.380]   not able to come.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.540]   Would you like to have the stipend?
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.460]   It's only for foreign students, and if you take it, since you're married, it will be
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.900]   770 Deutschmarks a month."
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.820]   Well, I was stunned.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.260]   I was just trembling.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:09.580]   "Ja, ja, jawohl, we would like to take it."
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:16.900]   And from that day until the end of our studies, those 770 Deutschmarks a month covered all
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.700]   our expenses so that we went into doctoral studies with no money in the bank, and we
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.740]   came home with no money in the bank and no debt and a baby from Germany.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:36.500]   Now, of course, the fact that we did it that way doesn't make it right.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.580]   But I think doing it this way can be right.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:48.100]   If your heart is right, and if you are trusting the promises of God and seeking to be holy
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:54.820]   in all that you do with a view to glorifying Christ in everything—so let me just say
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.380]   a word why I think that's so.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:02.500]   With regard to the circumstances in which birth control or conception control would
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   be better, with regard to the circumstances in which that could be right, I've done
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:16.220]   two "Ask Pastor John" episodes, number 230, number 552.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.860]   You can find them at the Desiring God website.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.980]   So you can check those out.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.700]   But the gist of the argument is this.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:32.160]   One, that according to 1 Corinthians 7, 2-5, sexual relations in marriage is not only for
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:40.900]   making babies, as glorious and blessed as that is, it has other purposes.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.460]   And that's the first step in the argument.
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:51.540]   Number two, having children in marriage is normative and good in the same way that marrying
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.660]   is normative and good.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.620]   Genesis 2-18, "It's not good for man to be alone."
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.620]   It's normative.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.580]   And yet, Paul says, "There may be kingdom reasons for not marrying."
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:10.380]   And I infer that similarly, there may be kingdom reasons for postponing pregnancy.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.280]   Not just selfish reasons.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.040]   If it's selfish, you should do it.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:22.720]   Now with regard to Noel working as the main breadwinner for a season, we considered that
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.780]   was a kind of extension of two biblical realities.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:37.480]   One is that women in the Bible and all through history were almost always fully engaged in
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:44.140]   making the farm, or whatever other family business sustained a family, making the farm
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.080]   a sustainable enterprise.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.000]   Just read Proverbs 31.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.020]   Nobody's a couch potato in this family.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:59.740]   It takes everybody to make the enterprise of our family and bread on the table work.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:07.180]   The other reality is that in thousands of situations, a husband may be either dead or
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:16.020]   incapacitated, which means that the sustaining of the family falls on every able-bodied person,
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.060]   especially mom.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:27.220]   So our thought was that my schooling, that short season, was essential to the long-term
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:34.020]   enterprise of the family as we conceived it, and Noel would look at this season, where
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:41.260]   she's the main breadwinner, as part of the overall united effort that we would make together
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:49.780]   to create a home that we thought God was calling us to long-term, with me as the main breadwinner,
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:56.700]   which I think is normative as part of what it means to be the head of a home in leading
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.340]   and protecting and providing.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:06.860]   So I hope that helps to give you at least a glimpse of one fallible couple's effort
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.460]   to walk in the truth.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.940]   Yeah, that is a super helpful word for young married couples and really for any married
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.940]   couple.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.540]   I'm surprised how many couples are not aware of this important word, abortifacients.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:25.260]   Abortifacients, it means chemicals that are designed to induce the abortion of a fertilized
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:31.460]   egg, most commonly through birth control pills, but also through Plan B morning after pills
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.460]   as well.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.100]   Every couple needs to be aware of what they do.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:39.500]   For more, again, see that pair of APJ episodes in the archive, episode 230, "Should Christians
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.260]   Use the Pill?" and episode 552, "Is Permanent Birth Control a Sin?"
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.660]   You can find those episodes and all of our episodes at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:56.820]   Well, is a Christian righteous or unrighteous?
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.780]   A simplistic yes or no answer is the wrong answer.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.940]   This is a tricky question and it calls for theological care and is our first question
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.780]   on the table next week.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.580]   Am I righteous or unrighteous?
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.580]   That's Monday.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.820]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.700]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:17.180]   [End of Audio]
