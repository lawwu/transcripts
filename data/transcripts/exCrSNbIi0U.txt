[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.120]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 175.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.120]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ, joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.480]   Jesse, we are fortunate you are able to make it in today.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.120]   This is an early Sunday morning, and it is snowing outside.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.160]   So I'm sure it was treacherous going for you to get here, but the truck made it.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.840]   Truck made it.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.800]   Yep, didn't have to use four-wheel drive.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.080]   I don't want to alarm Deep Questions listeners, but as I walked over to the studio today,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.120]   there was up to and including a quarter inch of snow on grassy surfaces.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.200]   And that like shuts down the DC area because they're afraid of snow.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000]   A little bit, yeah.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.680]   No, I believe the official, and I have the official rules here,
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.440]   is that if there's more than two inches of snow in the DC area,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.400]   and I'm looking at the city rules here, they just declare a purge.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   There's just no law.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.760]   You can just--
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.720]   Sounds reasonable.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.800]   Eat your neighbors, use burning cars to barricade your neighborhood.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   That's two inches of snow.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.760]   That's what happens.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.480]   No, but we made it today.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.480]   We made it in.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.680]   We're recording this early, so I am going on a trip.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.000]   So we're actually recording this quite a bit earlier than normal.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.440]   This is actually just a peek behind a curtain,
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.800]   just a couple days after we were in the studio recording episodes 173, 174.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.080]   So we're doing some back-to-back recording, get a couple into Cannes.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.960]   So we're going to have to talk sort of generically about the Super Bowl winners.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.520]   Man, that team really did well.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.120]   I'll tell you what, if there's some places where there's good talent,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.440]   there's talent in Ohio and California, both have a lot of talent.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.920]   It was really impressive how the one guy was throwing the ball,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.680]   and then that other guy caught it.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.960]   And then that team got a commiserate number of points,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.560]   and then that helped that team actually have the ultimate victory in the game.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.600]   So that's my timely Super Bowl chatter.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.560]   Sounds reasonable to me.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.360]   That sounds good.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.440]   Joe Burrow, go Joe Burrow.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.720]   Yeah, Joe Burrow.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.680]   I'm such a non-sports guy, I don't know who Joe Burrow is.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.880]   Joe Burrow is the starting quarterback for the Bengals,
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.680]   and he's an absolute stud.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.080]   Oh, this is the guy that they got with their...
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.680]   They went all in on like, "We just need to rebuild the quarterback
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.120]   with a high draft pick or something."
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.600]   Well...
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.000]   Or they traded for him or something.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   No, the Bengals got him with the number one pick.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.160]   He went to LSU, won a national championship, and then...
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.600]   He tore his ACL last year bad, but he's come back.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.280]   He's back in it.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.960]   Well, I mean, I think what this means is like,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.000]   you and I should do terrible sports radio talk.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.120]   Like, the whole premise is we go deep on sports
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.560]   that I know very little about.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.000]   So it's just a lot of me asking, "Well, who is that?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.400]   And what does that work?"
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.560]   And then we take in callers, and with every caller,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.600]   I'll just say, "You know, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   I'm sorry."
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.040]   And then we just go to the next caller.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.520]   "I think this would be great.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.160]   We figured it out.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.960]   We've cracked it.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.080]   We've cracked away."
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.600]   Because there's that...
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.320]   Who's that sports YouTuber guy that just...
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.800]   McAfee, who just got...
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, Pat McAfee.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.680]   Like, all of the dollars in the world for his podcast.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.800]   33 million a year.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   33 million a year.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.000]   He's also on Sirius.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.280]   All right.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.720]   So we're going to use a Pat McAfee style approach here.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.000]   Jesse and I are going to exclusively talk about sports.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.560]   He's like shirtless and like stands up and yells and stuff, right?
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.400]   He wears a tank top.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.160]   He's a funny guy.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.960]   He's also on...
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.400]   Mad Dog comes on right after him.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.920]   Mad Dog's like my hero.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.480]   They're completely different, but they're compatible.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.840]   All right.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.200]   Well, I think it's going to be great, especially for our foreign listeners.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.240]   I will be wearing a tank top, yelling about sports I do not understand,
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.880]   and telling callers that I have no idea what athlete they're talking about.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.720]   Except for the Nats.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.160]   You know what's going on.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.000]   I'll talk Nats, man.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.960]   I'll talk Nats all day.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.160]   There is a Nats podcast in the area.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.440]   Mark Zuckerman from Masson co-hosted.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.920]   It's called Nats Chat.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.920]   We got to do some synergy here.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.480]   If they ever allow to play baseball again, we got to get some synergy.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.600]   I'm going to have Zuckerman in here.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.920]   We're going to do an hour-long episode.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.720]   We're going to get deep on the Nats.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.040]   I'm going to record a podcast once from inside Nats Park.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.000]   We're going to figure that out.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.720]   These worlds are going to come together.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.160]   All of our energy is going into that.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.720]   But not this morning.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.560]   This morning, I want to put some energy into doing yet another core idea video.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.360]   Again, we've been racking these up, 10 to 15 minute videos,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.680]   where I'm touching on the big ideas I come back to again and again.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.760]   So you have something to reference, to save, and to share
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.480]   when you're interested in these ideas.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.280]   So I wanted to do another one of those today.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.200]   This is a core idea on a topic that actually
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.040]   was almost born on this podcast.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.720]   It was born as roughly the same time as this podcast,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.480]   and that is the deep life.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.640]   So let's go deep about what we mean when we talk about the deep life.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.440]   Now, I want to start with the background.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.920]   Where did this come from, this terminology come from?
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.400]   It's all about the beginning of the pandemic.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.680]   It's all about spring of 2020.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.320]   This is when I began, first on my email newsletter,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.840]   and then soon after on this podcast, coining the term the deep life
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.320]   and talking about it.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.400]   Now, what was it about that period that made this general type of topic
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.040]   really relevant?
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.280]   There's three things that went on.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.560]   So when the pandemic hit and there was those stay at home orders,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.720]   there was definite disruption in people's routines,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.440]   which is important.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.160]   When you're in a routine, you're used to going from this to this to this.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.880]   I'm in this job.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.320]   I want to get this promotion.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.520]   Where do we want to move?
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.200]   What's my next vacation going to be?
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.880]   It's very difficult to get some distance for critical self-reflection
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.080]   when you're just rolling all systems go.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.800]   So a lot of people, myself included, got interested in notions
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.880]   like the deep life when those routines were disrupted.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.480]   I think the early pandemic also did a good job for a lot of people
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.120]   of highlighting both the negative and the potential positive
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.360]   of their lives.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.560]   It helped highlight, well, what is it that I don't really like
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.600]   but I've been avoiding?
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.960]   I don't really like this condo I live in, in this sort of annoying neighborhood
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.760]   in this city, and when I'm forced to have to spend all my time here.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.920]   And I didn't have the normal escapes of let me go to the movies and a bar
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.640]   and weekend trips.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.040]   It really made it clear, I don't really like where I live.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.120]   Or having to spend all this time on Zoom with your colleagues,
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.680]   you're realizing there's excitement about commuting
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.000]   into my nice building downtown, but I don't really like these people.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.720]   So there's negatives that were highlighted
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.120]   by the disruption of the pandemic.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.880]   There was also positives.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.600]   Being home a lot, being around your family more, being outside more,
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.200]   getting separation from having to drive into your office.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.480]   So people also saw positives they weren't used to before.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.600]   And I think most importantly, things got very disrupted,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.720]   especially in the coastal places where we had mitigations that
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.560]   lasted for a very long time.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.200]   Schools were closed, jobs had completely different configurations,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.400]   people moved to completely different locations temporarily.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.120]   Like, let me go live with my parents in Colorado
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.600]   instead of being in suburban DC.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   And it showed a lot of people that actually really different stuff
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.680]   is possible.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.080]   You can do something different than what you have been doing
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.680]   and it's not going to fall apart.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   It's not as risky or scary as you once thought.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.600]   So we had these forces come together and people
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.040]   were stepping back and saying, I don't know,
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.360]   I want to rethink my life.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.760]   I don't know that I want to just get back
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.800]   to what I was doing before as quickly as possible
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.080]   and let's just keep rolling.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.840]   So that was the context in which we began
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.280]   talking about the deep life.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.840]   Now, the issue was, once we started talking about it,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.320]   is that this is a timeless topic and one that is universal.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.560]   Many, many people have these reflections
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.040]   on what a life well-lived is like and what they want out
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.600]   of their life.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.360]   It's one of the oldest, most cliched topics that we have.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.680]   But it's a difficult topic to actually get
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.520]   good pragmatic advice on.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.360]   This is what we quickly realized as we
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.760]   scanned the landscape of pragmatic or aspirational
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.800]   literature on this topic, is that there's three things you
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.840]   would come across.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   One, purely inspirational information.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.680]   Like, here is a story of a person who did something
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.880]   and just something about what they did hits me like,
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.360]   oh, that's cool, I want to do that.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.280]   You read Will Finnegan's Barbarian Days.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.760]   Like, man, there is something about him
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.680]   roaming the world surfing.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.040]   And something about that feels interesting and resonant.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   We don't know what it is.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.080]   It's just generic inspiration.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.400]   The other type of literature that
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.160]   was common addressing this topic would
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.680]   be hyper-focused on one aspect of your life.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.600]   So we've all seen this.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.000]   You hyper-focus in on one aspect of your life.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.040]   It's going to be self-acceptance,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.920]   or it's going to be intense fitness health routine,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.520]   or it's going to be a job.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.600]   I'm going to get out of this job and run a company,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.520]   and I want advice specifically about doing it.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.240]   So there's a lot of very specific advice,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.760]   but it just shoots like a laser beam on just one topic.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.680]   Or we get that genre of book where
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.880]   you have someone who says, OK, I'm
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.840]   going to try to improve my life and write about it.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.800]   And it's self-deprecating.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.320]   And typically in the genre of books,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.120]   the person has a child or a wife that's
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.960]   rolling their eyes at his efforts,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.040]   and it's kind of bumbling.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.920]   And in the end, he learned some good lessons
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.520]   and makes some small changes, but it's basically
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.440]   back to his same normal life he had before.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.720]   So there's that genre, too.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.600]   I'm going to go out there and change my life.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.760]   And they try all these things.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.560]   It's kind of kooky.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.880]   And they meet kooky characters.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.080]   And the main character's wife rolls their eyes
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.960]   at the bumbling guy.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.200]   And in the end, they're like, well, I have a better--
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.920]   in the end, I'm now doing some meditation and am a vegan.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.560]   And so some changes have been made,
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.480]   but they're basically back to where they were before.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.120]   Because you don't want to stick your head out too much,
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.800]   because people might push back.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.000]   So we didn't have a lot to draw on.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.840]   And so the thought I had at this point early in the pandemic
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   is, let's get specific.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.200]   Let's give this aspiration a name.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.480]   Let's give it a definition.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.200]   Let's come up with specific steps
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.960]   you can do to try to achieve it.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.160]   Let's be super specific.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.120]   Let's not just be vaguely inspirational.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.440]   Let's not just hyper-focus on one aspect of your life.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.800]   And let's not do this sort of weak sauce, self-deprecating
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.920]   memoir type thing.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.960]   Let's just get after it.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.440]   Now, of course, this is quixotic.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.600]   There's nothing more complex and ambiguous
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.360]   in trying to build a life of meeting.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.880]   Philosophers and theology have tried
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.280]   to tackle this for centuries.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.320]   So of course, what we're going to do
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.720]   is not going to be comprehensive.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   But I have found it's often useful to put
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.880]   a stake in the ground.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.920]   Let's put a stake in the ground and get specific,
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.200]   something you can go towards, see what works,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.880]   see what doesn't, and let that be a starting point for trying
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.560]   to get where you want to go.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.000]   Specificity is useful even when it's not comprehensive.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.560]   That is one of the big guiding lights of my advice.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.840]   So we introduced this term, the deep life.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.560]   Let's give a name to this generic aspiration
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.160]   a lot of people felt, especially during those early months
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.560]   of the pandemic.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.840]   Then we gave it a definition.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.800]   So what do we mean by the deep life?
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.480]   How about this for a definition?
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:19.000]   It is a life lived in radical alignment with your values.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.480]   Let's be specific about it.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.400]   Radical alignment with your values.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.560]   All of the parts of this definition matter.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.760]   So alignment with your values means
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.240]   you're focusing on things that are very important to you
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.720]   and not wasting too much time on things that aren't.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.320]   Radical means in at least some of these areas,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.520]   you have made really big head-turning shifts
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   or transformation in your life to pursue those values.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.880]   So not just small, but big.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.800]   You have to have both parts of those
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.200]   if you want to capture that thing that we intuitively
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.480]   are attracted to, that intuitive notion of the deep life
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.200]   that we know it when we see it.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.920]   If you just do the alignment with the values part
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.400]   without the radical, what do you end up with?
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.760]   Nothing bad, but also nothing phenomenal.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.120]   What you end up with is, hey, I tuned up parts of my life.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.080]   It's like the character at the end
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.840]   of those sort of weak sauce nonfiction memoirs.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.720]   You have slightly better health habits,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.960]   and you've joined a reading group,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.360]   and you're trying to walk more regularly, and you meditate.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.200]   And it's good, right?
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.760]   Like you've added things in your life
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.640]   to be more in line with your values.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.880]   If you're not doing that as bad,
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.160]   it's better than doing nothing.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.440]   But you're not going to watch a documentary
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.840]   about someone who has taken up a meditation habit
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.360]   and tries to walk more and be like, man, that's what I want.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.040]   That guy's got it all figured out, right?
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.880]   It's not touching you deep.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.680]   The radical piece is important too,
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.600]   because if you just do the radical
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.480]   without thinking about all the things that are important
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.400]   to you and aligning with things that are important to you,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.760]   you get this burst of satisfaction
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.840]   because just making disruptive changes
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.040]   is exciting in itself, and then it dies off.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.640]   Years ago, I read this book that had a great example of that.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.520]   It was a book that was called "Made by Hand."
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.280]   The author was Mark Frohenfelder.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   Now, Mark Frohenfelder went on to become the editor
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.000]   or co-editor of "Make" magazine.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.960]   So he became a big player in the DIY makerspace movement.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.520]   But he wrote this memoir,
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.720]   and I remember reading it years ago,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.040]   and for some reason, I remember being
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.000]   at San Francisco in the airport.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.120]   So I don't know what trip this was.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.360]   But they opened that book with him and his wife,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.240]   and they had some young kids at the time,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.760]   doing radical without the alignment of values.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.440]   Like, we just need to do something different, right?
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.320]   We feel this urge to live a deep life.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.600]   And what they did was they moved to an island
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.200]   in the South Pacific, just in the middle of nowhere.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.080]   I think it was like Rotonga or somewhere like this.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.600]   'Cause they're like, "Let's just be bold
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.040]   and do something completely new."
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.640]   It was miserable.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.720]   Like, it turns out you can't school your kids.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.360]   There's all sorts of insects and things
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.200]   that are stinging you.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.680]   There's very bad medical care.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.120]   And they felt really weird and guilty
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.480]   about being there year-round
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.920]   because it's an impoverished place.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.800]   And why were you guys coming here from San Francisco?
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.160]   And they just hated it, and they moved back.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.600]   So that was a radical change that wasn't built
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.240]   upon a very clear understanding of promoting things
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.720]   that are very valuable to you.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.160]   So you gotta have both the radical
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.880]   and the alignment with values.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.000]   You do those two things,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.160]   together you get something like the deep life.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.560]   So let me give a concrete case study.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.240]   This is someone I know.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.600]   I didn't ask him if I could use him as an example.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.280]   So I'm gonna try to be a little bit vague about details,
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.240]   and I'm actually changing a few of the details here.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.920]   But this is roughly a true story, someone I actually know.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.880]   All right, so I have a friend, longtime friends,
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.840]   who until recently, they were living in suburban DC,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.600]   out in Virginia, sort of suburbs of DC,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.240]   outside of the Beltway, right?
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.160]   So kind of relatively far out suburbs.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.040]   Now, it's a husband and wife with two kids,
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.440]   and they had a third kid around this time.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.280]   He did video production for hire
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.160]   and some of his own projects.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.640]   And would do some freelance copywriting,
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.040]   he's a sort of overly educated guy, a good writer,
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.240]   would do freelance copywriting
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.720]   for corporate public relations firms.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.080]   So writing press releases and stuff like that.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.920]   And then she had a wellness business online,
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   a pretty time consuming.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.040]   This wasn't like goop,
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.200]   like it wasn't gonna be a hundred million dollar whatever,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.600]   but it brought in good money,
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.320]   but it was also complicated and time consuming.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.040]   And they lived in the suburb out in Virginia
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.720]   where it was like very expensive.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.600]   They did not particularly like their neighbors,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   they didn't mind them,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.960]   but these like creative type people
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.000]   and the neighbors were all just
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.400]   dual income government employees
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.440]   who were living in that neighborhood
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.120]   because it clipped like a good school district
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.960]   and just striving,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.640]   like we just want our kids to like get good grades.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.320]   And just like commuter suburb,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.880]   everyone's commuting in and out,
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.120]   it wasn't that inspiring.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.040]   He had a WeWork to do his film production.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.960]   All you could afford was like a WeWork space
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.200]   that was shared and you kind of drive into the city to do it.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.480]   Like this was their situation.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.560]   And they were living in the suburb
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.880]   because one of their big interest was alternative education
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.800]   and there was a particular alternative school
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.400]   that was kind of around there
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.840]   so they could send their daughter there
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   and he needed to be near a city
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.960]   and so they were kind of trying to figure this all out.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.760]   Okay, pandemic hits, third kid comes along,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.920]   they're like, all right, enough of this,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.760]   we want the deep life.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.200]   Like if not now, when?
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   And here's what they did.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.120]   They moved to a plot of land,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.080]   it was 20 plus acres near the James River
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.280]   outside of Richmond, Virginia.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.280]   So they bought land, it has fields, forest, and riverfront.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.400]   Not nice land, right?
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.120]   This is not nice mansions or giant second homes,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.080]   but there's a modest home there,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.280]   fields, forest on the river,
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.640]   but also close to Richmond, 20 minute drive.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.000]   Okay, so they go out there, they buy that land.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.800]   It's cheap relative to anything in DC.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.520]   It's cheaper than the starting house
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.600]   they could buy anywhere in DC,
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.560]   which they were also looking at.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.120]   So this is not, oh, we have a lot of money.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.720]   This is actually much cheaper to buy land
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.280]   outside of Virginia than to buy a house in the DC area.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.880]   They just had their third kid.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.560]   He stopped doing the copywriting.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.040]   She put that company on hold
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.200]   because it was causing a lot of headaches.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.560]   They're gonna put their energy into their kids.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.080]   They're gonna homeschool their kids
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.320]   'cause again, they're really interested
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.400]   in alternative education
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   and they built this whole curriculum surrounding their land
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.840]   and a lot of their kids' experience
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.760]   was gonna be helping to clear this land
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.560]   and they're building these sort of cool
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.080]   yurt style buildings on the land.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.200]   And she got very involved
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.880]   in starting up a homeschooling cooperative.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.000]   So there's these other families
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.720]   that the kids would be doing things with.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.040]   And so they were going all in on
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.200]   being able to build that lifestyle.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.000]   And he rented, because everything's cheap in Richmond
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.600]   compared to DC, this really nice office space
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.640]   in downtown Richmond in the arts district.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.720]   It has like a balcony
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.360]   and he brought someone with him from DC.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.600]   And now he sort of can work
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.680]   in this new up and coming district of the city
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.000]   and he does his video production
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.760]   and they live much cheaper here in Richmond
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.000]   so they can kind of afford to not bring as much money.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.360]   And they built this whole different life
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.120]   that's very intentional and it's deep.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.560]   There's a radical component to it.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.960]   They're living in the woods on land
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.840]   and homeschooling their kids,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.280]   but it's all coming from alignment with things
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.480]   that are really important to them.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.600]   Slowing down, alternative education,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.240]   being around their family,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.760]   outside of like normal rat race suburban type of living,
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.720]   but also connection to arts and the cities and creativity,
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.920]   which he has with what he's doing in the arts district.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.120]   They shifted towards a deep life.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.760]   That is that definition in action.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.240]   So how do you do this yourself?
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.320]   Well, over the months,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.000]   we worked out some specific strategies you could try.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.880]   And most of the strategies that I talk about
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.440]   with the deep life start with,
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.840]   identify the different areas of your life
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.180]   that are important to you.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.040]   The deep life does not work
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.400]   if you neglect parts of your own existence
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.240]   that are important.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.960]   If you get too myopic, it's all about my work.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.880]   It's all about my religion.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.560]   It's all about my family.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.400]   You get too myopic, it doesn't work.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.240]   So you have to identify,
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.480]   let's start with just listing out
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.040]   what the different areas are.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.920]   For whatever reason,
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.240]   when we began talking about this on the podcast,
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.320]   we began to use the terminology buckets
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.480]   to describe these areas.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.120]   We say, what are the deep life buckets?
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.920]   What are the areas of your life that are important to you?
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   This list should be personalized,
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.340]   but as a starting point,
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.440]   we often talk about, for sake of example,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.820]   we'll talk about craft being one of these buckets.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.080]   So that's the things you produce or your work,
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.400]   but also other types of high quality leisure type activities
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.160]   where you literally create things in the world.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.240]   Community, it's your family, that's your friends,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.520]   and that's the people that live around you,
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.660]   dedication to that.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.840]   Constitution, that's your health, that's your fitness.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.600]   Contemplation, that's philosophy, ethics, and theology.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.500]   So the part of that Aristotelian deep thinking
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.680]   about what makes humans humans and the life well lived,
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.000]   that's a key part for most people.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.240]   We sometimes add a fifth bucket in these discussions,
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.680]   which we, to be alliterative, we call celebration,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.500]   which is that commitment to, with presence and gratitude,
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.720]   just enjoying things about the world.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.360]   You're really into craft beer
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.100]   and being able to be at that craft brewery,
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.560]   overlooking the valley, enjoying like a new brew
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.800]   that you really understand why it's really good,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.780]   and just having deep appreciation of that.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.640]   You're really into music and being at that show
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.480]   and really just being able to appreciate that artist.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.160]   So celebration is a big part of it
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.100]   for a lot of people as well.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.720]   So you have your buckets, whatever they are.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.560]   You have these different buckets,
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.280]   and the deep life has to respect all of them.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.940]   That's step one.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.600]   Step two is part of our deep life strategy
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   is let's warm up by developing a keystone habit
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.040]   in each of the buckets.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.420]   So something you do every day
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.180]   and you write down that you did it,
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.180]   that is relevant to that bucket and signals to yourself,
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.860]   I take this part of my life seriously,
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.500]   and I am willing to do non-required activity
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.860]   on a daily basis to support this piece of my life.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.260]   These should not be completely onerous or complicated
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.100]   because you won't do them,
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.360]   but they should also not be trivial.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.180]   You have to walk that line.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.380]   It's tractable, but meaningful.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.500]   They're simple, but you do them every day.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.940]   Now this warmup is about teaching yourself
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.980]   that you care about different parts of your life,
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.100]   teaching yourself that you are the type of person
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.600]   who does optional activity on a regular basis
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.320]   in pursuit of a greater good in your life.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.580]   A lot of people need that warmup,
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.780]   and it's something I think that is missed
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.860]   in a lot of self-help or advice type writing
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.880]   that we jump right into, just do this, this, and this.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.300]   Most people don't even have the practice yet
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.420]   with what does it feel like to say,
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.680]   shoot, I gotta go do this, and it's kind of a pain,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.980]   but then I get the satisfaction knowing
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.000]   that I did this thing anyways, even though it was a pain,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.180]   and you say, wow, I'm willing to do things
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.720]   that are a pain if I think they're important to me,
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.900]   and I think that's a key first step.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.980]   Next, once you have all those keystone habits going,
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.300]   pump is primed, you dedicate four to six weeks
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.500]   to each of your buckets,
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.580]   and when it's the turn of a particular bucket,
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.640]   you spend that time saying,
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.540]   now let me do a more significant overhaul
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.660]   of that part of my life,
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.020]   and this is an alignment overhaul,
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.620]   so what you're trying to do is clear out of your life
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.060]   stuff that's not that valuable that's related to that topic
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.060]   or that actively gets in the way
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.740]   of the things you care about in that topic
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.160]   while adding in place more things,
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.900]   a small number of things that are very important
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.620]   or valuable related to that,
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.120]   so when it comes to constitution,
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.940]   you're going through and really overhauling how you eat,
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.540]   integrating a fitness habit deeply into your daily routine,
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.980]   maybe you start training for something,
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.180]   so you take each element,
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.460]   so I'm gonna do a real overhaul there,
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.420]   clear out the distraction,
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.160]   pump up the thing that creates the value,
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.140]   pump up the things that creates the value,
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.740]   do this for each of the buckets.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.540]   Now at this point, you're really humming
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.940]   because two things have happened,
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.420]   one, you do really think about yourself as someone
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.060]   who can take optional action
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.620]   towards things that are important,
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.880]   and two, you've been doing non-trivial action
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.740]   towards all of these areas of your life that matter,
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.460]   and it is in that action that you get the real self-insight,
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.740]   it's in the fact that you spent a month
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.380]   focusing on just this part of your life,
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.020]   and now have lived the next four months
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.780]   with that part of your life being emphasized
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.140]   that you begin to gain real insight
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.340]   about what's important to you and what's not in that area,
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.300]   what matters, what doesn't,
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.820]   what opportunities out there are lurking,
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.820]   you're not just staring blindly at,
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.820]   I don't know, maybe I should live on a farm,
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.240]   maybe I should move to Rotonga,
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.500]   you're starting to figure out what really matters,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.860]   you get this nuanced understanding of yourself.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.660]   Now we're ready for the final step
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.340]   of the transformation towards the deep life,
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.380]   which is engaging the radical.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.780]   Now let's make some radical changes,
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.700]   we're leaving that suburb of DC
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.700]   and moving to the James River in Richmond,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.100]   now you're primed for that,
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.180]   if you start with that,
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.220]   you end up on the island in the South Pacific
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.200]   picking lice out of your kid's hair,
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.900]   worried about there being no doctors,
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.820]   and say we made a big mistake,
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.420]   but you do the keystone followed by the overhauls,
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.740]   now you're coming from a place of confidence
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.380]   and self-awareness,
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.960]   and now you say, okay,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.940]   what can we do that would be a radical shift
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.860]   that would further align us with these values
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.580]   I now much better understand?
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.980]   And here the best way to do it is lifestyle-centric,
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.220]   work backwards from various visions,
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.300]   you have to iterate through these,
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.300]   various visions of a lifestyle,
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.100]   lifestyles that are radically changed
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.580]   from where you are now,
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.380]   and you have to evaluate these potential new lifestyles
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.220]   in terms of their impact on all of the buckets,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.620]   what you're looking for is a lifestyle
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.940]   that has some sort of radical change that gets you there,
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.260]   but it enhances all of your buckets,
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.460]   not just we're going to an island in the South Pacific
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.820]   'cause it seems big,
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.920]   but what's it gonna do to community,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.180]   what's it gonna do to constitution,
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.140]   what's it gonna do to contemplation,
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.100]   what's it gonna do to celebration,
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.660]   you think about this whole new lifestyle,
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.260]   and you try to find one that,
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.300]   okay, this is tractable,
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.820]   we can afford this,
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.160]   and if we do this right,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.660]   this change is going to pump up some of these things
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.900]   we really care about very clearly into a big level,
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.580]   and it's not gonna get in the way of the other things,
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.860]   it's not gonna take one of these away,
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.340]   it's not when we move to the South Pacific,
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.340]   mean we never see our friends,
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.440]   we never see our family,
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.660]   we have no connection to our community,
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.100]   it's not gonna get in the way of any of these,
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.860]   and that is how you make the decision
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.280]   about doing something radical,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.980]   so it's after a lot of work and practice and training,
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.420]   then you try to make that shift,
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.180]   and then you repeat,
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.960]   and then you do these overhauls again,
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.500]   this is an annual thing probably,
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.380]   you go through your buckets,
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.220]   how's it going,
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.140]   what do we need to tune up,
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.780]   every few years you might step back and say,
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.860]   do we need another type of radical shift here,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:45.700]   you're not afraid of it
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.100]   because now you're not doing it randomly,
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.500]   now the radical is not reactionary,
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.900]   it comes from a place of informed self-awareness,
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.340]   it comes from a place of confidence and practice,
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.220]   and so that is my attempt to make this vague,
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.900]   but deeply aspirational idea
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.880]   that I want the type of life that when someone sees it,
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.660]   they say, whoa, I want that,
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.780]   I want that in my life,
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.420]   and I wanna get there in a way that's systematic,
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.540]   and this is the best strategy
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.820]   that at least on this podcast,
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.140]   we've been able to come up with so far,
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.780]   fix the word, fix the definition,
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.860]   fix the areas of your life,
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.140]   Keystone Habit Overhaul, lifestyle-centric,
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.460]   evaluation of different radical shifts
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.540]   to find one that might work,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.780]   and then take that radical shift,
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.060]   that's how you get to the deep life,
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.500]   it doesn't happen tomorrow,
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.620]   but it doesn't take two years,
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.020]   so if you are feeling that yearning,
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.420]   at least consider setting down this particular path.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.800]   All right, and that's what we have for today's core idea.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.700]   Now, I've got a good list of questions
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.740]   I wanna get into today,
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.180]   as normal, we have a group of questions on deep work
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.780]   and questions on the deep life,
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.600]   as always, before we jump into that,
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.940]   we should probably pay the bills,
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.300]   talk about a couple of the sponsors
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.540]   that make this show possible,
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.280]   so I'll start by talking about Headspace,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.820]   you have probably heard about Headspace,
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.140]   this is a guided meditation app,
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.440]   so it's an app where you can select
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.700]   from a very large library of guided meditations,
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.500]   and then you hear them straight in your ears,
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.660]   and that meditation brings you through,
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.420]   you follow it right there to get those benefits,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.660]   I mean, this is the time where this becomes relevant,
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.500]   I don't know about you,
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.380]   but the new year is over,
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.100]   we're in the depth of the winter,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.340]   it's snowing outside,
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.860]   Jesse's truck barely made it
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.020]   through the quarter inch of snow
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.340]   on the grassy surfaces today,
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.460]   like, this is the type of time
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.180]   where you're in your head,
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.020]   and you're anxious,
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.620]   and things are bleak,
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.400]   it is when you need to take your mental health seriously,
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.460]   and Headspace can really help you there,
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.260]   look, we all say fine,
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.700]   when we don't mean it,
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.540]   people say, how are you?
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.940]   And we say, I don't know, I'm just fine,
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.260]   but that's not really an emotion,
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.780]   we just say that even if we feel anger,
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.880]   sadness, or nerves, or anxiety,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.000]   this is where something like Headspace can help,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.700]   it is scientifically proven
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.460]   to help you manage your feelings and mental health,
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.180]   there's one study that came out recently
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.860]   that showed that just two weeks of using Headspace
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.900]   can reduce your stress by 14%,
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.380]   you can use Headspace meditations
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.540]   to relieve stress and anxiety,
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.040]   to sleep better, to improve your focus,
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.020]   they call themselves an everyday dose
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.820]   of mindfulness for real life,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.960]   Jesse, I'm not sure if you know this,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.140]   but Headspace, I found this
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.660]   when I was working with the app recently,
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.420]   has guided meditations for focus,
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.960]   so like, I wanna get into a mode of concentration
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.340]   on something hard I have to do, right,
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.140]   like I have to write an article,
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.900]   you can do a guided meditation for focus,
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.220]   and there's the music there,
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.900]   and it gets you locked in,
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.860]   and I talk a lot about deep work rituals,
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.500]   so that's not a bad one to throw into your mix there,
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.420]   'cause they know what they're doing.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.260]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.180]   - So here's what we can offer,
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.220]   however you're feeling, if you try Headspace,

[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.380]   one month free, look at that, that's pretty good,
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.260]   one month free, all right,
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.100]   so however you're feeling,

[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.000]   this is the best Headspace offer available,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.660]   so go to headspace.com/questions today,
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.160]   that's headspace.com/questions.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.620]   Let's also talk about Blinkist,
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.660]   I am a Blinkist believer,
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.300]   this is another one of the long time advertisers
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.220]   for the Deep Work podcast,
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.620]   with Blinkist you get access to short summaries,
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.580]   so we're talking 10 to 15 minute summaries
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:50.580]   of thousands of bestselling and important nonfiction books,
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.380]   so if you wanna know the main idea
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.980]   from a bestselling nonfiction book,
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.180]   you can listen or read the Blink,
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.780]   if you're a Blinkist subscriber,
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.980]   and get right to the chase, what are the big ideas,
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.900]   it's a good time to be thinking about that,
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.060]   it's the new year, we wanna get off to a good start,
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.000]   we wanna infuse our life with inspiring
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.900]   or interesting or very useful ideas,
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.500]   Blinkist can help you get there.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.380]   Now, Jesse, I've told you about this before,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.940]   but the way I like to use Blinkist is to figure out
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.220]   what books do I wanna read or not,
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.540]   so if there's a topic I wanna know about,
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.300]   I'll read the Blinks of all the related books,
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.780]   learn the lay of the land, learn the main ideas,
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.420]   and decide, oh, is there one of those books
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.740]   I actually wanna buy and read in more detail,
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.460]   so you add Blinkist to a reading habit,
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.420]   and I think you supercharge your reading habit,
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.180]   so it works pretty well.
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.980]   For example, technology and future,
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.340]   that's a category they have that I spend a lot of time
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.340]   in my own work looking at,
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.060]   if you're interested in Yuval Harari,
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.300]   maybe you read Sapiens, you said,
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.060]   oh, I know he has this new book, "Homo Deus,"
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.660]   and this other book, "21 Lessons for the 21st Century,"
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.700]   Blinks of both of those books are right there,
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.220]   you could jump in right away and say,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.180]   what exactly is going on in "Homo Deus?"
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.220]   Oh, I see, now should I buy this or not?
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.340]   Incredibly useful, I actually read the "Homo Deus" Blink,
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.840]   that was useful, "Irresistibles" on there.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.940]   Good friend of mine, Adam Alter, author of "Irresistible,"
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.820]   it's a great book about the mechanics of digital addiction,
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.140]   so we hear about this all the time,
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.340]   read the Blink of "Irresistible," get the basics,
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.380]   oh, now I know what I'm talking about,
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.380]   and if it hits you right,
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.940]   like now I know I need to buy this book and read more of it.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.980]   Anyways, if you're into the reading life,
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.900]   Blinkist is a good idea.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.340]   Be a bad sign if the Blink for your book
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.260]   was somehow longer or more comprehensive
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.940]   than your book itself, or if it was just like,
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.460]   or if the Blink, this would be the thing
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.260]   I'd be worried about, the Blink for my book
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.060]   was like two sentences long.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.620]   Like, we tried to condense this,
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.820]   and this is what this whole thing is about.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.060]   So you want a long Blink,
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.100]   like you want your book to have a meaty Blink,
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.420]   because that means you wrote a meaty book.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.540]   I think that's what it comes down to.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.020]   I haven't looked at my Blinks.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.220]   I think all my main books are Blinked.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.180]   I haven't looked at my own Blinks, though.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.180]   I probably should.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.420]   - Yeah, you probably should, check 'em out.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.580]   - Yeah, yeah, see what the people are thinking.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.140]   Hopefully when you read the Blinks of my books,
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.460]   you will say, "I gotta own this thing."
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.420]   But not just own this thing, I need four copies.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.140]   That's the right reaction when you read a Blink
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.980]   in one of my books,
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.380]   I need to buy multiple copies of this book.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.940]   - You've actually been getting a lot of questions
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.740]   about like the counterargument to stuff,
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.260]   so Blinkist would be a good way to dive into that, too.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.420]   - Yeah, because this is a discussion we've had on the show
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.820]   about expose yourself to alternative points of view
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.180]   to strengthen your understanding of a topic.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.140]   Blinkist is perfect for that.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.420]   Like, look, I'm not gonna go read six books
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.660]   just because my cousin was talking about something
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.620]   and I wanna understand it better,
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.420]   but I can do six Blinks, you know, no problem this week,
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.380]   and now I really understand something better.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.740]   - Yeah, it's a good point.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.580]   - Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.940]   just for our audience.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.380]   If you go to blinkist.com/deep,
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.500]   you can start a free seven-day trial
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.500]   and then get 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:12.340]   And that's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:17.340]   blinkist.com/deep to get 25% off and a seven-day free trial.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.500]   That's blinkist.com/deep.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:26.060]   All right, I think it's time that we do some questions.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.220]   So I got some questions here and we'll start as always
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.280]   with some questions about deep work.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.820]   Our first query comes from Jack.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.380]   Jack asks, "Any tips for time blocking
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.160]   for those of us in ADHD land?"
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.980]   Well, Jack, I hear a lot from people with ADHD
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.940]   and they talk about the various habits I talk about,
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.580]   which ones work well, which ones don't,
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.760]   which ones need to be adjusted.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.460]   And the thing I hear most consistently
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.560]   about time blocking is that it's a double-edged sword.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.780]   So time blocking for those in ADHD land
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.700]   is actually really, really useful
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.220]   in the sense that having clarity about,
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.380]   I'm doing this, that I'm doing that,
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.320]   and then I'm doing this.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.260]   I mean, committed to that habit
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.580]   can be a really good target aimer for your attention
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.500]   and make it less likely that you fall into a rabbit hole
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.620]   as compared to, let's say, a list reactive approach
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.900]   where after each task, you say,
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.620]   let me just look at my inboxes and calendars
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:25.860]   and think about what I wanna do next.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.180]   If you're in that mode
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.820]   and you're combining that with ADHD,
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.220]   it's very difficult to make, let's say,
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.400]   a difficult, persistent progress
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.460]   on things that need to get done
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.020]   because there's so many shining objects pulling at you.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.520]   The double-edged sword of time blocking in this context
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.920]   is you can't over block it.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.120]   You can't overdo it.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:44.960]   If you try to build
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.860]   one of these heroic time block schedules
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.900]   that's 10 hours long with 15 different precision blocks,
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.820]   it's really asking a lot from anybody
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.180]   to stay so on task and so focused
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.940]   and deny the lack, the cognitive energy draining,
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.900]   the distractions pulling us.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.740]   That's hard for anybody,
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.460]   but if you have ADHD, that becomes almost impossible.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.860]   So you need to rely on blocks
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.740]   while at the same time not blocking too much.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.080]   Bigger blocks, break blocks,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.420]   and not trying to squeeze too much precision work
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.420]   into any one day.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.920]   So that's why it seems to be a double-edged sword.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.380]   You're kind of screwed if you don't do anything like that,
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.260]   but you're also setting yourself up for failure
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.560]   if you go overboard with the method.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.160]   So hope you find that useful.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.260]   All right, moving on, we got a question here from Andrew.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.820]   Andrew says, "I'm starting a PhD.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.260]   "How would you approach a PhD knowing what you know now
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.140]   "regarding deep work, et cetera?"
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.900]   Andrew, assuming you're looking for an academic job,
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.940]   assuming that's why you're doing a PhD,
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.260]   care a lot more about the research topic right now.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.980]   When you're very new, you've got to think,
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.820]   where is there heat right now
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.900]   just beginning to emerge in my field?
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.500]   And I want to be working on something like that
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.880]   with the best possible people
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.100]   who are helping develop that field.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.500]   I underestimated this, I would say, in my PhD program.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.340]   I didn't think about it.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.820]   I just said, I'll deal with the job market
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.020]   when I deal with the job market.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.340]   But really what you want to be doing,
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.180]   if your goal is to get an academic job,
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.160]   is to say, I want to align myself with someone
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.100]   who's doing something very hot right now.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.160]   'Cause here's what's gonna happen
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.980]   when I enter the job market.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.420]   They're gonna say, we want,
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.480]   whatever your advisor's name is.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.180]   And then the response will be, well, she's not available.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.260]   She already has a job.
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.860]   They'll say, all right, well, can we get basically
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.220]   like a clone of this person
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.540]   who also knows how to do that work?
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.060]   Like, great, who is her student?
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.500]   Let's get that person instead.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.140]   That's where the really good job offers come from.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.260]   That's what opens up options.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.380]   So care a lot about what research you're working on
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.340]   and then get in the habit of working on research
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.400]   every single day.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.840]   I'm gonna suggest the first three hours of every day.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.520]   The first three hours of every day,
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.800]   you're reading stuff relevant to a paper or article
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.840]   or essay you want to write,
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.520]   or you're directly writing a paper, article, or essay.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.200]   So three hours a day, every day, you're always doing work.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.560]   That adds up.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.400]   Produce, produce, produce, okay?
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.360]   So align yourself with the hottest topic you can.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.800]   Someone who's doing great work on a field that's emerging
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.000]   really makes such a difference.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.540]   We really underplay topic.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.140]   Research topic is so important on the job market.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.640]   It's not just, here's a generic talent.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.000]   It's like, we're hiring for this topic.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.220]   And then B, three hours, three hours every day.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.320]   And also in your writing, don't do what I just did,
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.760]   which was enumerated one, followed by B.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.280]   That's the type of stuff that's not gonna go well
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.720]   in your article for whatever academic journal.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.760]   - All right, he's getting his PhD in film studies.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.600]   - Yeah.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.760]   - I was wondering what your thoughts on,
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.440]   even on that film study kick with books and stuff.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.260]   - Yeah.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.200]   - A lot of people have PhDs in film studies?
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.320]   - No, but it's a department at a lot of universities,
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.440]   but not every university, right?
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.040]   So it's not as widespread as like English or something.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.480]   But film studies is a great example.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.840]   I mean, basically in film studies,
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.560]   you need to be aligning yourself with an emerging
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.680]   framework of critique that seems to have a lot of heat
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.440]   around it, is what I would say.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.880]   And then you need to start reading all that
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.400]   and writing in that as early as possible.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.940]   Align yourself with someone who's doing really great work
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:26.060]   with that new framework or type of critique and master it.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.540]   And you gotta be doing reviews and essays
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.980]   like pretty early on, is what I would say.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.800]   - Yeah, film studies would be cool.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.640]   - Yeah, I read that textbook.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.200]   It's a complicated field, man.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   - Yeah, that's why I was curious.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.440]   - Yeah, it's all complicated.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.000]   I mean, it's like any other field, I think right now.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.200]   So like whatever the, there's like theoretical frameworks
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.640]   that get popular and then they infuse lots
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.480]   of different fields.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.280]   Like film studies is very susceptible to that.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.320]   So whatever is big at the time.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.060]   So if we were talking 15 years ago,
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.840]   you're gonna get a lot of sort of post-colonial theory
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.680]   or queer theory.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.360]   And now there's like a lot more specifically
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.480]   post-modern critical theory subsets
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.120]   that are like really injecting themselves
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.240]   through film studies.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.560]   So like probably what you should do in film studies
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.300]   is look to an emerging theoretical framework
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.840]   that's generating a lot of heat in another major field
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.440]   that hasn't yet made it to film studies
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.860]   or is just making it there.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.840]   And then be one of the people that helps usher it in.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   That's like a pretty sure path to academic jobs.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.560]   All right, Andrew, let's move on here.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.960]   Alex, Alex asks, what's the best way
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.180]   to meet other deep workers?
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.600]   I'm a freelance writer.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.200]   I make a living doing deep work.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.200]   I love to meet regularly with other people
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   who prioritize deep work to compare notes,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.040]   discuss goals, et cetera.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.240]   But I do not know where to find other people like this.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.680]   Alex, that's a good question.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.640]   I don't, I mean, I've been thinking about it.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.420]   I don't have an answer, first of all.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.840]   I don't have a great answer for you,
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.300]   but it gets me brainstorming.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.680]   Maybe we should be involved in finding a better way
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.000]   of helping people do this.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.380]   Like, I don't know, Jesse, what do you think about,
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.400]   what would be good here?
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.920]   Like, let me tell you like a model
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.160]   that's interesting to me.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.800]   Mr. Money Mustache, Pete Adney, yeah?
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.640]   - I was thinking exactly--
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.480]   - Are you thinking about it?
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.300]   Right. - Yeah, you're gonna,
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.480]   I had a feeling you were gonna mention that.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.240]   - Yeah, so Justin and I have talked about this.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   But so, Mr. Money Mustache, who blurbed digital minimalism,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.640]   so I met him when I was working on that book.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.720]   He's a personal finance guy.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.120]   Made a bunch of money with his personal finance website.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.560]   He lives in Longmont, Colorado,
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.540]   and he bought just a building downtown in Longmont,
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.420]   and they renovated it,
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.340]   and it's basically like a coworking space.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.820]   But it's like a coworking space, but it's also a gym.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.220]   They have like an outdoor gym,
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.380]   and they have a lot of kegs there
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.460]   for these like evening talks.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.940]   So they bring in people to talk about,
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.820]   I guess, business and stuff like this,
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.980]   and they have talks, and craft brewers in the neighborhood
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.260]   bring in kegs of beer.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.780]   It's just created this whole physically located,
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.820]   physically cited community about, in this case,
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.020]   people who believe in his sort of,
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:16.020]   whatever it says, financial advice type philosophy.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:21.260]   But like, should there be something like this for deep work?
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.300]   - I think people pay a small fee to go to this thing,
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.700]   like $50 a month or something like that,
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.820]   and you submit some small application.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.060]   You gotta live in the area.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.460]   - Yeah.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.280]   - Yeah.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.540]   - But like, coworking space that's like deep work focused,
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.380]   not a bad idea, actually.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.300]   - And if we had a building here in Tacoma Park
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.220]   where you could come in,
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.980]   and I don't know what would make it deep work focused.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.220]   I think I would probably,
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.000]   pulling from the Utimotia machine,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.140]   there'd be the common space and then pods.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.940]   Like you go into these pods to do deep work.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.180]   It's not even like, oh, here's my office.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.260]   No, that stuff can be out in the common space.
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.180]   You can go into these pods to do deep work,
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.540]   and then there's like kind of a more social space.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.780]   And then like another space is just for, I don't know.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.060]   I don't know exactly how it would work,
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.820]   but that would be cool.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:02.660]   That'd be cool.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.780]   It's something you could see happening more commonly
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.600]   across the country.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.860]   So Alex, I'm just using this as a chance to brainstorm,
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.220]   but I think there's like a deep work
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.860]   meets we work play here that could be cool.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.500]   At a smaller scale, Jesse,
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.940]   like should we do an event you think at some point?
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.500]   - You had mentioned this early on in your podcast.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.580]   - Yeah, I got lazy.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.300]   - I was like, oh, I'll definitely go to that.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.460]   This is before I even started working here.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.220]   So I was definitely gonna go whenever you announced it.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.420]   - Yeah, like that could be fun.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.420]   I mean, it seems like a pain.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.340]   That's why I didn't do it,
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.540]   because I had no time.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.660]   But if we had some help, it could be interesting.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.820]   We have some, I don't know where we would do it.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.100]   If we would do it here in Tacoma Park
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.980]   or do it somewhere where we had more room.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.500]   It just had a lot of people in the DC area
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.340]   who are into this stuff.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.380]   Like let's all get together and just like-
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.820]   - Go down near a Nats game.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.580]   - Go down near a Nats game, yeah.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.540]   Yeah, do it in the dugout.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.420]   It'd be awesome.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.140]   But yeah, we could do it down there.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.900]   We could do it here at the restaurant
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.920]   that the Deep Work HQ is over.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.540]   I mean, I don't know how much space we have here.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.780]   I don't even know how many people would come.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.260]   That's my question. - Probably a lot.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.900]   - My only, I'm trying to think,
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.940]   my only benchmarks,
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.020]   I've done some book signings here in DC
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:15.860]   that were pretty popular.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.980]   I did one for Digital Minimalism at Politics and Prose,
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.420]   and we definitely standy-roomed only that place.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.940]   And then when Scott Young was here,
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.380]   we did a joint one down on 8th Street
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.980]   at a bookstore down there.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.020]   And we definitely standy-roomed only that place.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.260]   So I don't know, we might get a good crowd.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.260]   It's kind of hard to tell.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.500]   All right, let's think about that.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.380]   Yeah, 'cause I haven't seen people.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.200]   I mean, I see people now.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.700]   I do speak in events again and stuff like that.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.180]   So I do see people, but that might be kind of cool.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.580]   We get together like a lot of deep life, deep work,
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.840]   deep questions type people.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.900]   We all get together and just meet.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.740]   People can meet each other.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.740]   Like, hey, here's some other people that, you know.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.340]   - People meeple. - People meeple.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.100]   Yeah, deeple meeple with some people meeple.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.260]   The problem is I'm like an introverted curmudgeon
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.700]   who is a mythanthrope and say,
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.740]   I don't wanna bother talking to people.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:02.660]   Sometimes I'm in that mood.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.660]   And then other times, like, I wanna meet all my listeners
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.580]   and readers and it just depends on like my mood for the day.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.900]   Oh, well, so Alex, we're working on it.
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.860]   All right, that's the long and the short of it.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.700]   All right, let's move on here.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.700]   Shane asks about effective and speedy Zoom meetings.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.580]   Contradiction in terms, I don't know if that's possible.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.500]   Let's get some more details here.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.540]   He's in some group.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.340]   They had their first meeting with 12 members.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.140]   And while the agenda was set
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.500]   and the reports were sent out prior to the meeting,
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.820]   it still took nearly two hours.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.580]   And so Shane is frustrated with Zoom meetings.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.020]   Yeah, look, here's the thing about meetings like that.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.580]   First of all, meetings with 12 people
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.420]   where everyone gets to just talk are a huge waste of time.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.500]   So the idea is we have like a 12 person board
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.180]   and let's all just get together and kind of discuss things
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.020]   and figure things out.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.580]   That's a huge waste of time.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.940]   It's better to say, okay,
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.900]   there's one person gonna present this thing
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.020]   and here's our proposal.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.300]   And then we have like a 15 minute Q&A period
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.940]   and then a suggestion is gonna be made.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.660]   So more structure there really matters.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.660]   In general, having more processes for work
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.900]   before the meetings make a big deal.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.940]   So the more you're trying to accomplish ad hoc
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.460]   and on the fly in the meeting itself,
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.300]   the more the meeting is gonna be dragged out
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.700]   and frustrating.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.540]   And the more you say,
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.100]   this is our mechanisms for making decisions,
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.620]   the more that's in place ahead of time,
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.940]   the more focused and effective your meetings can be.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.580]   So if there's some process ahead of time
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.860]   for here are the motions being proposed
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.500]   and there will be a 10 minute discussion
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.220]   of the motion at like at one meeting.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.100]   Then there's gonna be a period of, I don't know,
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.300]   I'm just making this up,
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.180]   of like back and forth, whatever,
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.300]   people are marking up with emails or thoughts
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.740]   in like a shared doc, how they feel about it.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.540]   And then a concrete proposal is brought up
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.860]   for a vote at the next meeting.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.460]   There's a 10 minute Q&A portion
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.300]   and then the vote happens on something specific.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.140]   Right, what I'm talking about here
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.860]   like really clear processes for how things happen.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.420]   We're part of the process is like,
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.180]   here's where discussion happens,
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.920]   this type of discussion on this piece for this long.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.180]   That gives you a lot more control
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.940]   as opposed to let's just figure this all out in the meeting.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.540]   Once you have more than three people,
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.540]   that's not gonna go very well.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.560]   The other thing that's really useful
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.780]   is to make everything concrete.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.700]   Okay, we're talking about this topic in this meeting.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.740]   Here's a shared screen where I'm taking notes,
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.020]   this conversation is going to conclude
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.900]   with a clear action item assigned to someone.
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.860]   So when people know that like this is live ammo
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.420]   they're playing with,
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.540]   they're usually a lot more circumspect and careful
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.180]   about just let me just chime in and bloviate.
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.340]   When it's like, here's the thing we're trying to get to,
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.920]   like this person is gonna do this thing,
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.580]   makes it more serious than if they think like,
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.540]   we're just time wasting, like let's all just talk about it
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.460]   and hopefully this dies away
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.860]   without me having to do more work.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.660]   So it's like, okay, here's our goal.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.020]   I'm gonna take notes on what people are saying,
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.540]   we're gonna clarify, okay, let me clarify
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.140]   then let me propose that these will be the next steps.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:54.960]   What do we think about it?
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.460]   We changed it, great, Jack is gonna do it, move on.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.740]   So be really clear.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.940]   Everything you're discussing is wrapped up.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.700]   It's written down, wrapped up, summarized and assigned.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.660]   All right, Zoom effective and speedy Zoom meetings,
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:09.620]   not a lot of those.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.320]   All right, let's do one more deep work question.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.820]   We have one here from Heather.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:19.820]   Heather asks, how do I make a better transition
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:24.380]   from working from home to afterschool with the kids?
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.940]   So Heather says, pre-COVID,
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.840]   my transition from a working mindset to mom mindset
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.120]   was easy since there was a 30 minute commute
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.700]   from the office to aftercare.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:38.040]   Now I permanently work from home and there is no transition.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.040]   They get off the bus when school is out.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.280]   She says in parentheses, we nixed aftercare since I am here
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.800]   but is that a bad idea?
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.160]   In parentheses.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.480]   But I'm still getting a few things done
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.980]   during that hour, thoughts.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.740]   All right, well, Heather, my specific thought
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.000]   for your situation is you should not have nixed
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.920]   the aftercare.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.520]   Work is work.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.360]   Don't let the fact that the work is happening at your home
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.380]   make you change the status of that work to be half work.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.560]   Work slash I'm also doing another job
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.840]   which is taking care of my kids
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.580]   after they get home from school.
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.360]   I mean, that's sort of equivalent of being like,
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.500]   I work at this office job,
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.400]   but for like two hours in the afternoon,
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.480]   I'm also serving food in the cafeteria.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.220]   Your bosses will be like, well, you can't have both those
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.580]   jobs at the same time, right?
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.540]   Like, you know, when you're here in the office,
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.780]   you can't also be serving food in the cafeteria.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.500]   Like this is your job here.
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.100]   But when we work from home, we blur those lines a lot more.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.340]   And we say, yeah, but I could do like childcare too.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.740]   And can I just mix that all together?
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.940]   And it's very hard to do.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.580]   This is why during the heat of the pandemic,
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.320]   when schools were closed and offices were closed,
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.900]   I kept describing the situation as a dumpster fire
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.180]   because it was impossible when you ask people,
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.680]   do all your work and do all the childcare
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.200]   and do that at the same time.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.560]   It's like being the cafeteria worker at the same time
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.640]   that you're trying to be an accountant.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.760]   It's impossible and we pretended like it's not.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.880]   So my specific answer for you, Heather,
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.080]   is if at all possible financially,
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.460]   go back to exactly the same care setup you had pre-pandemic.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.160]   And it sounds like the setup you had was after school,
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.680]   your kids went to aftercare,
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.840]   which brought them to the normal end
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.200]   of a standard nine to five workday.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.800]   And then you would pick them up.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.840]   Go back to that aftercare.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.220]   Yes, you're working at home, but who cares?
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.000]   You're working till work is over
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.160]   and then you're shifting over to the mom mindset,
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.220]   not trying to mix the two.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:28.240]   So if that's possible, that's what I would suggest.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.960]   Let me give a more general answer here
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.980]   about I think a very good point, more generally,
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:39.720]   shutting down when you have a hazy boundary
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.400]   between work and non-work, which again, is pretty common,
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.640]   especially in these work from home days.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.280]   So you might have this hazy period.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.880]   So let's say the aftercare thing doesn't work out.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.500]   You have this hazy period where you're kind of working
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.740]   and you're kind of doing something else
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.060]   and you recognize this, you don't schedule meetings
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.500]   and you know you're just gonna get a little bit done
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.200]   because you're also doing childcare.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.340]   You have to find how to have a definitive shutdown
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.220]   that still works.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.420]   So even if you're in this hazy period,
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.880]   have a definitive into the hazy period.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.820]   All right, now I'm doing my shutdown complete.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.620]   Even though the last 90 minutes I've been half shut down,
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.300]   I have to get my kids going with their homework
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.620]   but then I have to return and answer emails
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.460]   and I have to get snacks
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.600]   and then I'm going back and sending out these reports.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.040]   Even though that's back and forth and hazy,
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.580]   have a clear shutdown at the end of that
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.780]   where you're like, now work is completely done.
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.260]   Now, if possible, if you can have one
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.340]   that gets you out of your house
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.620]   and completely changes your state,
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.120]   I think that would be good.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.480]   I don't know your marital situation,
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.540]   but if you have, let's say a partner that's working,
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.140]   sounds like here, maybe they're working at an office,
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.500]   when they come back,
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.100]   that spells you to do a 30 minute transition
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.780]   to really fully change your mindset.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.100]   I think exercise is a good one here.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.180]   I've been doing this some more,
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.260]   especially on my teaching days
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:52.140]   when I can't get exercise in earlier in the day.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:55.180]   I'll do this when I'm with the kids in the afternoon,
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:59.300]   I'll set it up so maybe one's working on their homework
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.380]   and one's playing Minecraft and I'll let my youngest,
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.300]   I'll bring them down to the basement
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.720]   to where my exercise equipment is.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.820]   Like, okay, you can watch this video here
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.800]   and then I'm gonna go in the garage
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.500]   and do evil things to a rowing machine.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.980]   And it's a transition,
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.460]   even though I'm kind of watching the kids,
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.300]   the exercise is very different.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.420]   It's very different than looking at a screen.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:21.020]   And it really is a way of, okay, now I come out of that
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.940]   and I've physically changed my state.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.940]   And I come out of that not doing other types of work.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.660]   So have a clear shutdown,
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.180]   even if that shutdown happens after a period
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.940]   of sort of hazy boundaries.
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:38.100]   All right, so let's wrap up questions about deep work.
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:42.740]   I wanna do a few quick questions about the deep life.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.660]   But before we get into it,
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.260]   I wanna talk about two more sponsors
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.500]   that makes this show possible.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.740]   Jesse, these are both food related sponsors.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.420]   So you can tell I'm getting hungry.
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:55.860]   Both food related sponsors that I actually really enjoy.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:52:00.460]   So the first one is MonkPak and that's M-U-N-K.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.220]   And I wanna talk in particular about MonkPak
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.660]   Keto Nut and Seed Bars.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:11.440]   So these are granola bar style snack bars,
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.020]   but instead of just being full of sugar and junk,
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.900]   they have one gram of sugar or less,
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.380]   two to three grams of net carbs,
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.140]   and they're only 150 calories.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.640]   Now they have that name keto in the title
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.000]   because they were originally designed
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.540]   for anyone following a keto lifestyle
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.280]   because they're so low on carbs.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.460]   But they're a perfect snack for anyone
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.300]   who's trying to eat better,
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:35.940]   cut back on sugar and carbs without sacrificing taste.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.140]   These are really good tasting bars.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.820]   The key to me with granola bars is they can't be too hard.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.000]   So these are soft, but they have nuts on them.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:43.960]   So you get a bit of a crunch.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.520]   I think they taste great.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.960]   They have a lot of flavors, sea salt, dark chocolate,
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.260]   caramel, sea salt, and peanut butter, dark chocolate.
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.760]   I'm a big sea salt, dark chocolate fan.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.880]   I mean, you eat that thing, at least in my case,
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.260]   you're hungry, it's in the afternoon,
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.180]   you don't wanna eat junk, but you need something.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.340]   You've been podcasting all day.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.160]   You've been stuck in the studio with Jesse.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.420]   You're like, I gotta get some food.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.860]   Jesse insists on everything being keto friendly.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.240]   Actually, Jesse just doesn't eat.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.400]   Do I have that right?
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.360]   Here's Jesse's diet plan if I have this right.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.620]   Like eat one meal every three days.
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.200]   Is that how it goes?
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.360]   - I just eat dinner.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.200]   - He just eats dinner.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.160]   Okay, so you're around Jesse all day.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.280]   You're like, he makes me hungry just seeing him.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.960]   But you don't wanna eat junk.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.800]   You grab one of these keto nut and seed bars.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.640]   It tastes great.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.460]   You feel like you're having a treat,
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.960]   but it doesn't have the junk in it.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.600]   So I'm a fan of those.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.440]   I ate them all.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.300]   So they sent me some and I went through them really quick.
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.760]   That's how I judge their Leica products.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.720]   Like, okay, I am eating these things good.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.960]   In addition to being keto friendly,
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.600]   they are gluten-free, plant-based and non-GMO,
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.600]   no soy, no trans fat, sugar, alcohols, or artificial colors.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.460]   So try it for yourself and you'll see.

[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.420]   We thank them for sponsoring the podcast.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:39.700]   Another thing I wanna talk about food-wise
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:42.700]   on the sponsor is Just Egg.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.260]   I am an egg guy.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:49.900]   I have eggs almost every day for breakfast.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:54.900]   That's my thing, but that's also a lot of eggs.
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:55:00.540]   This is why I was excited to learn about Just Egg.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.980]   Now this is a cholesterol-free plant-based egg
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:06.640]   that will give you the most decadent quiches of your life,
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.100]   the fluffiest scrambles,
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.480]   and the easiest egg sandwiches of all times.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.360]   It has about the same protein as a chicken egg,
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.740]   but less saturated fat.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.080]   And plus, Just Egg is packed with cholesterol-lowering,
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.200]   polyunsaturated fat.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.120]   Chicken eggs wish they were this healthy, right?
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.980]   So because Just Eggs comes from plants,
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.600]   you're also helping to save our planets.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.560]   And that's nice if you're into the whole
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.940]   saving the environment thing.
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.720]   So Just Eggs allows me, for example,
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.600]   to still have my routinized habit of eating eggs
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.820]   every morning without actually going through
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.980]   that many actual chicken eggs every week.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.200]   I can throw Just Eggs into the mix
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.600]   and have a cholesterol-lowering plant-based alternative
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.460]   that still tastes roughly the same.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.440]   Just Eggs are so good,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.200]   they might even convince Jesse to eat food
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.240]   more than once a week and before 6 p.m. or whatever.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.740]   So what happens, this is Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.480]   So do you go nuts on a night like tonight?
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.360]   - Today I'm definitely gonna eat wings
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.120]   and then some other good stuff, yeah.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.160]   - But no food until then?
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.160]   - I mean, the game's on at 6.30 anyway.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.640]   - Okay, all right, yeah.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.000]   So you're gonna destroy some wings tonight.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.400]   - Yeah, I'm gonna have wings, eat whatever I want, and then--
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.960]   - And then not eat again for seven days.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.200]   - Yeah, I might not eat tomorrow.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.120]   Tomorrow might be no eat.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.040]   - All right, so don't be like Jesse.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.640]   Eat more regularly, substitute in some Just Eggs,
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.440]   show off the new cholesterol-free you
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.680]   by buying a bottle of Just Eggs today
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.680]   and doing the planet a solid at the same time.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:45.540]   Just Eggs, really good eggs.
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.140]   All right, let's do some really good questions now.
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:52.960]   I wanna do a few here about the deep life.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.020]   Let me find my questions, my goodness.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.940]   You see how the sausage is made, guys?
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:02.460]   Oh, here we go, here we go, I see.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.180]   All right, we got ourselves some questions here.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:11.160]   First one comes from Agnes McGyver, awesome name.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.180]   McGyver, do you watch McGyver?
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.700]   We're the generation.
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.580]   - I've seen it in the past, yeah, for sure.
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.180]   - Yeah, McGyver's awesome.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:23.700]   So Agnes McGyver, which is, I believe, McGyver's aunt.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.140]   It's just basically the name,
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:29.100]   like the aunt that sends him a birthday card.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.780]   All right, Agnes McGyver says,
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:34.060]   "I've been applying deep work concepts and time blocking
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:36.380]   "to both my personal and professional life.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.040]   "I'm ambitious in both.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.120]   "Do you recommend creating a clearly defined separation
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:40.960]   "between the two?
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.240]   "Do I use two time block planners?
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.240]   "I catch myself wanting to open a time block planner
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.340]   "and plan out my personal life."
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.460]   Agnes, I usually recommend do not fully time block
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.220]   your personal life if you're also time blocking
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:55.860]   your professional life because it's too much structure.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.220]   You will eventually burn out.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.900]   Time blocking is very artificial.
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:02.020]   All right, so when you're time blocking,
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.540]   it's not like you are rolling with our natural instincts
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:07.380]   of humans about how we approach our time.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.180]   It is an artificial solution to the artificial load
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.980]   of diverse work tasks that we get poured on our plate.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.860]   So it's not easy to do, but it works.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:18.180]   It gets a lot done, it keeps things in control,
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.620]   it allows us to survive the deluge of tasks
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:23.700]   that's thrown at us in the modern work situation.
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.820]   In a perfect, slow productivity enriched world,
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.460]   you might not need time blocking at all,
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.660]   but we need it today.
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.580]   But you don't wanna do something so difficult
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.440]   and so unnatural in every waking hour,
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:33.740]   you are gonna burn out.
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.160]   So go lighter in your personal time.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.420]   I often just recommend sketching a plan.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.060]   End of the day, it's the evening, what's going on?
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:45.500]   Well, is there any time specific things we need to remember?
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.340]   Let me jot that down.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.540]   We're going to dinner,
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.820]   I have to pick something up from the store,
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.100]   and then you sketch out other things you wanna get done.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.140]   Here's my plan for tonight,
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.340]   I wanna get some reading in later,
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.040]   I wanna watch this show.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.540]   You kind of figure out a reasonable plan,
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.480]   you kind of jot it down.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.420]   It's not planning out every minute.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.620]   Here's the things that have to happen,
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:02.820]   here's some things I wanna get done.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.820]   Rough plan, do your best.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.140]   Same thing for weekends.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.860]   Well, I'm gonna go, we're going on this trip
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:10.700]   for most of Saturday, but I wanna get a walk in before.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.140]   You're just sketching out a plan.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:15.060]   So it's not a full-time block plan,
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.580]   but it's not just winging it, it's somewhere in between.
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.580]   I think that's probably the right balance between the two.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.420]   All right, Samantha asks,
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:25.460]   how do I pick a college major
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:29.000]   if I shouldn't follow my passion/interest?
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.120]   Well, so Samantha, this is where I can point again
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.440]   to my core idea videos.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.220]   There is now a core idea video live on the YouTube page
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:40.460]   about my idea of not following your passion.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.160]   So the background for this discussion
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.960]   can be found on that video.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.060]   Everyone can go reference it
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:48.460]   to get the specific thoughts behind my ideas about passion
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.800]   and its role in career selection.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.500]   And the thing you will notice
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.940]   if you go back and re-watch that video
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:59.340]   is that passions/interest
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:05.040]   is a problematic conjunction there, not the same thing.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.380]   So the issue here
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.740]   is you're joining those two things together.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.180]   Passion is the idea that you are wired
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.460]   for a particular pursuit or direction,
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.100]   and that if you align yourself with that pursuit,
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.180]   you will be happy and fulfilled,
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.180]   and if you don't, you won't.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.620]   It is a very high bar.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.020]   There's one true thing you're supposed to be doing,
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.860]   get it right or you're screwed.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.420]   Interest is, here's something that seems interesting to me.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:34.340]   There can be many things that seem interesting to you,
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.260]   and many things that don't.
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.380]   I think interest is a perfectly fine criteria
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.260]   to help select, let's say, a major.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.260]   This major seems interesting to me.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.000]   I like the opportunities it would open up if I did it well.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.060]   Good, go for that.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.700]   And what if there's five majors that pass that criteria?
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:53.200]   Then it doesn't really matter which one you choose.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.480]   Passion is not the same as interest.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.940]   Passion says there's one true thing.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.460]   If you get it wrong, you're screwed.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:00.860]   Interest is just a useful piece of information
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.540]   you can use in making a choice.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.900]   So what I'm trying to do here is lower the bar.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.820]   Lower the bar when it comes to selecting something
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.900]   like a major or selecting a career,
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.060]   lowering the bar from there's one right answer,
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.700]   if you get it wrong, you're screwed,
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.540]   down to there's a lot of reasonable pursuits
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.100]   on which you can build a enjoyable academic career
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.860]   and which you can build an enjoyable professional career.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.100]   There's a lot of them.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.140]   So give it a little bit of thought,
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.580]   but once you find something that's reasonable,
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.280]   go with it and don't overthink it.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.460]   I think the straw man that you're sitting up here, Samantha,
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.820]   is throwing the bar out and say,
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:33.900]   no, it doesn't matter what you do.
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.460]   Just choose completely randomly.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.940]   Film studies or computer science,
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.500]   I'll just throw a dart, who cares?
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.720]   And I think that's nonsense, right?
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.620]   Like we have inclinations, we have interest,
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.620]   we have skills we've already built out
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.780]   in one area versus another.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.400]   We like the lifestyles enabled by this path
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.200]   better than the lifestyles enabled by that path.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.100]   Use all that information to make a selection,
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.580]   but just don't overthink it and be happy with the fact
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.860]   there might be a bunch of different choices
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.780]   that all satisfy those criteria.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.780]   What really matters is what you do next,
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:05.500]   what you do once you actually made that choice.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.180]   And the reason why this is important
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.580]   is that it was actually college majors
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.500]   was the original thing that got me interested
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.420]   in the topic of following your passion.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.540]   It was the original thing that set me down the path
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.780]   to writing my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.980]   Because what I was seeing when I was a graduate student
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.620]   writing advice for students
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.940]   is I kept hearing the same story again and again.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.660]   Students at these elite schools like MIT
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.140]   would come time to choose their major
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.540]   and they'd been taught, follow your passion.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:39.460]   So they believed there's one major I'm wired to do.
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.580]   The chorus of angels will start singing
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.700]   if I choose that right major.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.620]   And if I get it wrong, it's gonna be bad.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.260]   And here's what would happen.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.100]   They would get to their junior year.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.540]   The courses would get harder.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:50.740]   Why did the courses get harder?
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.500]   Because they're in their junior year.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.260]   This is where you have to take the upper level courses
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.660]   that depend on the intro courses as their prerequisites.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.040]   Hard courses aren't super fun.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.340]   The problem sets are difficult.
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.580]   It's frustrating, you can't get things right.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.420]   They're difficult.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.740]   You get worse grades on essays than you're used to.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.420]   That's part of how this works.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.740]   But because these students were taught,
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.300]   you have a one true passion in the course
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.540]   that angels will sing if you find it,
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.500]   they would take this hardness,
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.620]   this sense of, oh, I don't love this every day
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.500]   as an indication that I must not have chosen
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.100]   the one true passion.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.740]   How could this possibly be my one true passion
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.500]   if it's frustrating me and I don't love it?
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.300]   And know what they would do?
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.780]   They would switch their majors late in the game.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.660]   And it would be a problem
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.940]   because it's hard to start from scratch with a new major.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.100]   And it was this epidemic of late stage major shifting
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.460]   that actually first got me interested
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.380]   in these topics of passion culture.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.340]   I thought this was crazy.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.620]   Like, what are you guys doing?
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.220]   You can't switch your major this late.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.940]   Like you're gonna have to spend an extra year.
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:46.780]   You're gonna be scrambling.
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:47.600]   You're gonna be miserable.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.460]   But they were so sure that passion was a thing
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.940]   and passion means you'll love it.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.740]   And they weren't loving it because,
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.700]   you know, the differential equations you're doing
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:59.340]   in your junior year in your physics major are a pain.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.020]   And they would switch and it would really be bad for them.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:01.860]   It would really be negative.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:03.780]   It would hurt their academic life.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.540]   It would make them miserable in their personal life.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.020]   And it didn't open up any new opportunities.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.420]   And so that's what actually got me
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.660]   into this topic in the first place.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.960]   So no, we're not wired to do one thing,
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.940]   but it doesn't mean we can do everything.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.540]   So use reasonable criteria to make a choice.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:18.940]   Have a reason why you choose something,
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.180]   but don't over sweat that reason.
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:22.540]   And don't be worried if more than one thing satisfies it.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:26.060]   There's lots of path to a passionate, interesting life.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.580]   You don't have to find the one true thing,
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.140]   but you do have to give it a little bit of thought.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:35.900]   All right, let's put in one more question here.
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.620]   So final question here comes from Liata.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.220]   Liata said, "Is there a place where I can find
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:45.000]   all of your insights from the podcast written down?"
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.860]   She says, "I often listen to your podcast
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:49.920]   when walking to work, but can't keep stopping,
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.800]   pulling out a notebook and writing your ideas down.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.820]   I know that many of your ideas appear in your books,
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.220]   blog and New Yorker articles,
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.600]   but do they cover all of your ideas?
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.980]   If you espouse a new idea in the podcast,
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.780]   you always write it down somewhere for future prosperity.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.020]   I'm thinking I might have to stop listening
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.920]   to your podcast when walking and instead treat it
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.800]   like listening to a lecture, i.e. sitting down at a desk
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.000]   and writing down notes."
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.800]   Well, no, there's not right now a place
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.960]   where every idea from the podcast is written down,
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.360]   but there's a few things I will suggest here.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:23.360]   One, the big part of the YouTube page we launched,
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.500]   and I keep trying to make this point,
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.520]   is not about trying to build up a large YouTube audience.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.940]   It's not about trying to be a YouTube influencer
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.920]   that is getting people to smash the subscribe button
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.720]   while doing giveaways on Minecraft videos.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.560]   It's not the goal.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.400]   The goal is to make the information
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.240]   from the podcast much more usable.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.580]   So now the big ideas I talk about
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.200]   are gonna have a core idea video.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.760]   You can go to the core idea playlist on YouTube
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.480]   and see in one place, me talking about each of the big ideas
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.800]   on which I base a lot of my answers.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.580]   So if you hear a particular answer,
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.480]   like where's that coming from?
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.320]   There's probably gonna be a core idea video
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.980]   where the foundational ideas are.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.280]   There's deep dives on there.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.720]   Usually when I'm working out an idea,
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.320]   I might try it a few times in answers,
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.120]   and at some point I'll do a deep dive on that idea.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.960]   There's a playlist of just those deep dives.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.260]   You can go and see those.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.720]   If there's a particular question, you say,
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.440]   "Man, I'm walking and I hear this question,
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.840]   and that seems like a big idea."
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.120]   Well, there's gonna be a video of just that question
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.720]   within a couple of days of that episode airing
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.220]   that you can find in Bookmark.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.160]   And you could just go and look at the show notes,
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.160]   like, "Oh, what was that question called?"
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.000]   And you'll find it.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.880]   It'll be posted pretty soon after it comes out.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.800]   So I'm hoping the YouTube page will make it easy
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.440]   for people to begin pulling out.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.840]   Like this will be the good archive of the information.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.340]   Now, when the portal launches,
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.760]   the standalone portal launches
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.780]   from which you can access all of the videos
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.120]   and podcast episodes without even having to go to YouTube,
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.800]   it is gonna include a dedicated page
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   for every episode of the podcast.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.640]   You're gonna see the show notes,
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.040]   the description of every question
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.400]   in that episode on that page.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.640]   You are gonna be able to play it straight from that place.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.580]   You're gonna see every video taken from that episode
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.840]   accessible in a horizontal carousel
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.000]   right there from that page.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.960]   Once we're doing that,
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.360]   we might start adding more information to our show notes.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.360]   So that will become a pretty good record as well.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.600]   But we really are hoping that people can remix
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.900]   and gather their favorite questions,
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.520]   their favorite videos, et cetera.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.520]   Now that they're all accessible,
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.040]   people can find them, they can put them into their own pages,
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.420]   they can put them into their own playlist.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:31.880]   So we're really thinking this through.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.960]   But the YouTube page was a major step
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.040]   towards making the information in this podcast
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.320]   way more accessible and findable and saveable
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.800]   than it just being in the long form audio.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.040]   So Liata, start there, get used to the YouTube page,
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.440]   bookmark or save videos that are important to you,
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.520]   create your own playlist.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.520]   That's probably the right way to begin collecting
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.280]   the things we talk about on the podcast
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.040]   that are of particular interest to you.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.320]   All right, well, what's of interest to me right now
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.160]   is wrapping this up.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.640]   We are short on time.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.160]   So thank you everyone who sent in your questions.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.720]   Remember to check out that YouTube page,
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.400]   see videos of all the questions and segments
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.240]   we talked about today,
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.240]   as well as videos of the full episodes.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.280]   If you like what you heard,
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.840]   you will like what you read
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.640]   on my longstanding email newsletter.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.560]   You can sign up for that at calnewport.com.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.360]   I'll be back on Thursday.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.600]   The listener calls episode.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.400]   And until then, as always stay deep.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.200]   [MUSIC]
