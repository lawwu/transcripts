[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   I made 10 grand off of a coin that I had bought for 400 bucks and I was like probably in seventh
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.400]   grade and I had bought this Franklin half dollar just basically generic silver coin
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.240]   and it was graded already so it was in like one of the holders that PCGS or NGC or like
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.080]   grading companies the same as sports cards you can get them certified and have a specific
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.960]   number attached to it and so I was able to get that number upgraded pretty quickly by
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.760]   using different techniques that restoration people would use so I was pretty good at doing
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.120]   what they would call just coin restoring so I'd be able to identify it, get it re-graded
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.760]   and then be able to sell it again.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.480]   That's a specific path that a lot of people do in the coin industry to make a lot of money.
