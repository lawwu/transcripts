[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   a licensed tax preparer, is saying, "I deduct all my haircuts because they're my brand."
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.720]   And he's like, "Well, I deduct my blue suits because blue is my brand."
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.360]   And that's your perfect example of he's saying he's relying on IRC 162, which is our classic
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.320]   ordinary necessary business expenses. So you go there and you say, "Okay, yeah,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.640]   well, it says ordinary necessary business expenses." The mistake he's making is he's
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.200]   looking at it and saying, "I think it's ordinary necessary to my business."
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.360]   It's literally just made up in his mind when obviously what we want to do is go to the tax
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.960]   law. So then what do we do? We look at treasury regulations. For this one specifically,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.600]   it doesn't help us. So then we go to court cases. The court cases say, "That's cute,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.800]   but you're going to get a haircut anyways." They say personal grooming. It's so inherently
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.600]   personal. It can't be for business purposes. And then we get that same result for clothing.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   There's actually a three-part tax court test for clothing. And so the one that everyone violates
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.720]   is it can't be suitable for personal use, even if you only use it for business.
