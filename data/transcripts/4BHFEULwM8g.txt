[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.760]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.160]   We are back to talk about education,
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.900]   specifically how do we pursue education in this world
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.120]   without getting taken captive
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.200]   by the thinking of this world?
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.960]   It's a question we get often from students
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.560]   navigating higher learning
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.040]   and wanting to do so with discernment,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.120]   both in non-Christian and in Christian schools even.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   James, one listener, asks it this way.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.840]   Hello, Pastor John, I'm a Christian studying philosophy
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.680]   at a secular university.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.640]   What steps can I take to do, as Colossians 2:8 says,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.860]   and avoid being taken captive by philosophy
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.220]   and empty the seat according to human tradition,
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.960]   according to the elemental spirit of the world,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.040]   and not according to Christ?
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.880]   And the question comes from Michael as well.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.040]   Hello, Pastor John, I'm about to begin my senior year
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.560]   as a philosophy major,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.400]   and I am currently working on an honors thesis
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.640]   on Christian compatibilism.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.600]   As I have felt God lead me to study philosophy
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.480]   and take great delight in what I study,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.240]   I also recognize that Colossians 2:8
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.480]   challenges the study of this discipline as a whole.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.760]   While I esteem the Word of God above all else,
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.880]   I also believe that the study of philosophy
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.180]   can be used for the church.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.640]   The question that I would like to ask is,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.500]   in your view, what is the role of Christian philosophy
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.200]   and where should one take care
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.240]   in the pursuit of this discipline?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.080]   Is it okay to explore possibilities
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.340]   and things that Scripture does not directly deal with
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.320]   as long as one does not speak with authority
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.760]   on these issues?
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.800]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.200]   - Well, thanks for the question.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.320]   I was a literature major in college,
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.920]   but I did have a philosophy minor,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   so I had enough of a taste to be able to resonate positively,
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.960]   because of my experience at a Christian school,
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.380]   positively with what they're saying.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.380]   The word philosophy occurs one time in the Bible,
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.240]   namely in Colossians 2:8, where it says,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.120]   "See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.000]   "and empty deceit according to human tradition,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.520]   "according to the elemental principles of the world,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.080]   "and not according to Christ."
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.880]   So let's think about this verse for just a moment,
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.440]   and then we'll step back
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   and think about the larger task of philosophy.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   The word philosophy, both in English and in Greek,
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.720]   literally means love, philos, of wisdom.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.080]   Sophia, love of wisdom.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.160]   It means thinking about the great issues of life.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.100]   What is ultimate reality?
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.560]   How can you know it?
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.960]   What's right and wrong?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.700]   What's the good life?
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.960]   In and of itself, therefore, one would, I think,
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.080]   be inclined to say, who could find fault with that?
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.000]   Like, loving wisdom?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.320]   Well, of course, we should love wisdom
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.760]   and pursue it with all our might.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.000]   In fact, this book of Colossians is filled
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.440]   with positive references to wisdom.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.880]   Colossians 1:9, Paul prays that they would be filled
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.120]   with spiritual wisdom.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.480]   Colossians 1:28, Paul says that he teaches everyone
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.160]   with all wisdom.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.240]   Colossians 2:3, he says that in Christ are hidden
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.680]   all the treasures of wisdom.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.400]   In Colossians 3:16, he tells us to teach
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.080]   and admonish one another with all wisdom.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.840]   In Colossians 4, 5, he says, "Walk in wisdom."
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.280]   My goodness, it seems to me that in view of all that,
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.240]   just in Colossians, I mean, not to mention
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.720]   all the other places in the Bible,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.080]   it seems to me that in view of all of that,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.720]   it would be a sin not to love wisdom,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.440]   not to be a philosopher in that sense, right?
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.080]   A wisdom lover.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.800]   So if you just take the word philosophy,
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   love of wisdom, by itself, it would surely be a good thing.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.360]   But Colossians 2:8 says it's not a good thing.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.960]   Why not?
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   Paul says four things about philosophy in Colossians 2:8,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.240]   and let's look at them to see what the problem is here.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.200]   First, he says it is empty deceit.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.640]   Deceit means that it pretends to offer a fullness,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.440]   but is in fact empty.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.360]   It pretends to be full of what would make the good life
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.520]   and bring us lasting satisfaction
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.560]   and finally get us to eternal happiness,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.240]   and none of it is real.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.680]   It proves to be totally empty
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.400]   and leaves us miserable in the end.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.960]   That's the first thing he says about this so-called
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.440]   philosophy that he's worried about in Colossi, empty deceit.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.160]   Second, it is, quote, "According to human tradition."
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.960]   In other words, it has no true warrant from God.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.800]   It's coming out of human heads rather than from God's mind.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   It's mere human thinking, not dependent on God's thinking.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.520]   Of course, and this is the really interesting part
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.720]   about philosophy, aspects of human thinking,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   human thinking, can parallel or overlap
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.560]   with God's revelation of his own thinking in Scripture
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.040]   and in the world, but what Paul means
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.400]   is that this teaching doesn't carry in it
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   any built-in submission to God's thinking.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.600]   Therefore, it is fundamentally flawed,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.560]   not because it may not have some overlap with truth,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.680]   but because at its root,
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.800]   it doesn't care about conforming to God's truth,
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.960]   and therefore, even in those places
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.440]   where it may parallel some divine truth,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.000]   it has the aroma of error because it doesn't love
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.640]   that truth as coming from God and conforming to God
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.400]   and glorifying God.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.360]   That's the second thing he says,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.820]   human tradition, mere human.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.320]   Third, Paul says this so-called philosophy
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.880]   is according to the elemental principles of the world.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.560]   Now, later in the chapter, Paul explains
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.000]   what he means by elementary principles.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.960]   He says in verses 20 following,
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.560]   "If in Christ you died to the elemental principles
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.480]   "of the world, why, as if you were still alive,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.400]   "do you submit to regulations?"
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.080]   And these are, I think, the names
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.880]   of the elemental principles.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.560]   "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.120]   "according to human precepts and teachings."
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   These have indeed an appearance of wisdom
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.520]   in promoting self-made religion and asceticism
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.320]   and severity to the body, but they are of no value
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.520]   in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   Virtually every philosophy points to a way to live
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.040]   that it considers wise or profitable,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.640]   the path to greatest meaning, greatest satisfaction.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.480]   And in this case of this philosophy
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.400]   threatening the church in Colossae,
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.720]   the way to live in this philosophy
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.840]   was summed up in certain ascetic elements and rules,
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.400]   elemental principles, they call them,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.080]   rules so that through severity to the body,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.600]   one might find a pathway to illumination
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.840]   and to good life and the approval of angels.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.800]   And it was backfiring because this ascetic rule-keeping,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.400]   this philosophy, was feeding the sin of pride
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   rather than subduing the power of sin.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   And the fourth thing he says about this philosophy
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.920]   is that it is not according to Christ,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.480]   which is the fundamental issue for him.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.960]   It says in 2:19, Colossians 2:19,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.520]   "Not holding fast to the head
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.360]   "from whom everything is coming."
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.280]   So as we step back now and ask,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.960]   how can the study of philosophy,
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.440]   the history of the love of wisdom
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.520]   as humans have tried to see it,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   how can this study be made truly profitable
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.960]   rather than a snare like it was at Colossae?
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.920]   And I think the central answer
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.280]   in the book of Colossians is this.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.480]   If you want to measure all philosophy rightly
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.080]   and thus profit from what God has revealed
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.480]   by special revelation in his word
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.000]   and general revelation from the writings
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.640]   of influential thinkers in history,
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.800]   if you wanna profit from that,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   one, know Jesus Christ as he is pervasively
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.200]   and profoundly revealed in scripture.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.280]   And two, treasure his fullness
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   as the ground and goal and access to all true wisdom.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   And three, live in a way that shows in your life
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   how this wisdom defeats pride and sin and exalts Christ.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.680]   I say it that way,
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.480]   with those three criteria of good philosophy,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.400]   knowing Christ as supreme,
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.480]   treasuring Christ as supreme,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.040]   showing Christ as supreme in your life,
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.880]   because of these texts in Colossians, Colossians 1:15.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.800]   He is the image of the invisible God,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.760]   the firstborn over all creation,
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.320]   for by him all things were created in heaven and on earth,
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.640]   visible and invisible,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.520]   whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities,
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.520]   all things were created through him and for him.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.120]   In other words, he is the ground and the goal of everything,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.640]   all true philosophy.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.400]   Colossians 2:7, be rooted and built up in him
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.680]   and established in the faith.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.280]   All true life flows from him as root and foundation.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   Colossians 2:8, do your thinking according to Christ.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.800]   Let all thought, all affection, all action,
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   accord with Christ and all that can be known about Christ.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.040]   Colossians 2:19, hold fast to Christ as the head,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.200]   that is hold fast to him as the all supplying one.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.320]   His redemption makes all knowledge
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.480]   and all the enjoyment of all that is good possible
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   for forgiven sinners.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.480]   And then Colossians 2, 3, in him are hidden
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.800]   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   Whatever is valuable in any truth found anywhere
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.960]   is the way it points to Christ.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.040]   Let me say that again, 'cause that's a little complex.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.960]   Whatever is valuable in any truth found anywhere,
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.720]   whatever that value is, is this,
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.080]   it's the way that truth points to Christ
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.640]   and helps us know him and treasure him and show him.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.860]   That's the truth.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.140]   That's what's found in him.
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.640]   There are very, very few scholars in the world
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.560]   who are willing and able to pursue wisdom
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.720]   that is due philosophy in this Christ saturated,
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   Christ treasuring, Christ showing, Christ exalting way.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.640]   But if you can, if God gives you the grace to do that, do it.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.920]   - Yeah, very good.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.740]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.440]   And thank you, James and Michael for the questions.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.520]   If you have a question of your own,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.500]   get it to us via email through our online home
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.600]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.360]   We're now headed into the weekend,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.840]   but with a big week ahead.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.240]   On Wednesday, we're going to look at
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.040]   what we as Christians do with our disordered desires.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.080]   We still have those desires in our hearts,
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.560]   those disordered desires.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.960]   So what do we do with them?
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.960]   That's on Wednesday.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.120]   Then Friday, we look at whether or not
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.840]   we can become more holy by treating our bodies more harshly.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.880]   It's an important discussion on asceticism to end the week.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.960]   But first up on Monday, we start the week
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.840]   looking at the power of our adversary, the devil.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.840]   The Bible tells us that Satan has been disarmed.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   So what did he get disarmed of?
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.240]   What powers did he lose in the death
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.240]   and resurrection of our Savior?
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.160]   Wow, see, I told you, it was a big week ahead.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.840]   and we will see you on Monday.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.880]   Have a great weekend.
