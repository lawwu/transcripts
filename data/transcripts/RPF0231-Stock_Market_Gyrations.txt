[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.840]   memories with your little ones.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.080]   I'm a little late to the party, but not too late.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.060]   And I've decided to go ahead and take the bait and talk stocks today.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.820]   Global stock markets all over the place.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.760]   US stock markets also all over the place.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.440]   And today I'm going to share with you some ideas and some thoughts that I hope
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.620]   will be useful to you as you try to figure out if you should be changing
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.920]   anything in your portfolio.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:57.280]   Welcome to the radical personal finance podcast.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.960]   My name is Joshua sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.240]   This is the show where we work each and every day to help you clarify your
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.800]   path to financial independence.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.440]   And today we're going to talk about that within the context of investing
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.080]   quite frequently, actually, you get these opportunities to do that.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.160]   And it's always interesting to try to tackle a current event with a long-term
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.240]   perspective, but let's see if we can do that today.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:31.560]   Been a busy last couple of weeks around the sheets household here and around the
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.360]   radical personal finance global headquarters.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.920]   We have indeed moved, as I mentioned to you on a recent show.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.120]   And so the move has been, uh, it's been great, but it's also been more
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.080]   challenging than I thought.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.920]   The biggest challenge in our lives right now is working with a colicky baby.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.360]   Uh, and that's really been a major impact.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.200]   And also I have been working day and night to get our old house ready to list and
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.880]   ready to sell and have been moving as fast as possible, had a goal of having it
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.320]   finished.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.680]   As I record this, it's Tuesday, August 25, 2015, had a goal of being finished by last
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.200]   Friday, but had some things come up, uh, that the house wasn't quite ready.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   So now I'm working hard to get done by the middle or realistically end of this
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.480]   week.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.400]   So that's the biggest priority for me right now is to get that house on the market.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.400]   And so as such radical personal finance has taken the toll and I apologize to you
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.800]   for that.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.000]   Hopefully, uh, you will all be able to understand.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.800]   I am convinced that it's a great move just as I see how much my situation, my
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.560]   time is going to be freed up with being just in the future, being able to produce
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.640]   the show and being able to bring you more content.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.920]   I'm, I'm extremely excited about it and I'm learning a lot of things about the
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.760]   real estate process and a lot about myself.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.320]   I'll bring you all those details on a future show, but, uh, the, the show content
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.880]   here has been spotty and hopefully, uh, you can understand and bear with me.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.480]   I expect, uh, after August, September ish year, I expect, uh, things to be much
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.280]   more consistent and hopefully we'll, we'll turn the corner both with personal
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.760]   life and, and, uh, business life.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.240]   Uh, but I want to talk about a stock market.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.040]   Now it's been a little tough.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.560]   I didn't get my studio fully set up and had some issues even getting it, uh,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.160]   working here in the new house.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.320]   And so it hasn't been easy for me to get things set up and I've been watching
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.480]   the, uh, stock market drops over the last few days.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.240]   If you're not familiar, it started late end of last week.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.200]   Uh, and then yesterday, Monday, uh, was, uh, the market open was in the United
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.800]   States was marked by greater than a thousand point decline in the, in the Dow.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.880]   And so this obviously is food for fodder from all, all perspectives with finance.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.080]   And this is an interesting, an interesting time for me to be watching
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   things because I'm in a unique position, which I've never been in, uh, through
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.040]   the course of my adult life, ever since I started paying attention to money.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.600]   And I'm in the unique place of sitting on the sidelines completely and absolutely
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.920]   of this, uh, of these market changes.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.440]   Uh, ever since I was, I guess I'd say probably about 18, I've been an investor
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.760]   in public and trade of securities.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.000]   Uh, so I've owned stocks through every market change since I was 18, which
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.440]   would have been 95, 95.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.040]   So it would have been about the end of the nineties, uh, that, uh, I was born in
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.880]   1985.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.160]   So end of the nineties was about 98, I guess would be when I was 18.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.800]   And I started to purchase my first mutual funds.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.280]   Then I've been for the last six years in the marketplace as a professional
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.400]   investment advisor, uh, having a direct financial interest in the movements of my
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   clients and being a steward of their funds.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.040]   And so those are different perspectives that bring different potential biases
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.640]   into, uh, into my own life.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.600]   As an investor, we often are going to have a, uh, a bias and a desire to kind of see
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.920]   ourselves doing the right thing.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.200]   And so we're going to have, usually if you listen to most people talk about
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.920]   investments, they've got their way that is what they're convinced is right for
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.760]   them, but they're not able to step back and be objective about it because the pain
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.280]   of a change or the pain of admitting that they might be wrong about something is
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.200]   too deep, too difficult.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.840]   Also, uh, there are conflicts of interest as a financial advisor.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.400]   Uh, there are conflicts of interest with, uh, where your fees come from, with where
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.440]   your markets come, where your, just your revenue comes from with the actions of
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.080]   your clients.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.920]   This is a constant challenge that financial advisors face.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.360]   And it really is truly, uh, a challenge.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.000]   If you're, if you get paid fees based upon your clients being invested in
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.920]   stocks, and that's the bulk of your earnings.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.600]   And if you get paid fees based upon your clients continuing to be invested in
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.720]   stocks, that does create a powerful incentive for you to encourage your
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.640]   clients to stay the course.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   And you've got to recognize that.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.880]   Doesn't mean you can't surpass it, but you've got to recognize the conflict of
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.400]   interest.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.880]   But the interesting thing is for the last year, I've had no personal financial
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.680]   connection to anybody else's investment accounts.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.200]   I don't earn any fees off of anybody's investments.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.480]   I don't do any, uh, asset management services.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.760]   So I make, I have no financial incentive to, uh, to maintain a certain course of
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.200]   action with regard to investments.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.320]   Doesn't mean that I don't still have biases.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.240]   So for example, one of the interesting things I've, I've been giving time as
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.240]   I've transitioned here on radical personal finance, I've gone, been going
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.920]   back and kind of examining some of my own biases, examining some of the things
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.960]   that I previously believed to see, do I still believe these things?
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.640]   Uh, just so if you walk away from a certain way of, of, of acting and
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.960]   thinking, it doesn't mean that immediately, just because you don't have
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.800]   a financial incentive, uh, that all of a sudden you can walk away from your
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.680]   pattern of thinking.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.200]   Best example to illustrate that, that I can think of is if you, uh, let's say
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.560]   that you're raised in a, uh, a devoutly religious family, a Christian family or
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.760]   a Muslim family or Jewish family, and then you decide, well, I need to change a
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.280]   course.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.760]   And I've decided that the way I was taught is not how things are.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.040]   And you become atheist.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.480]   So you transition doesn't mean that all of a sudden now the entire way of
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.920]   thinking in which you were trained is suddenly changed.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   Or if you go the other way, you're raised in atheist and, uh, you're
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.200]   converted to become a believer.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.280]   Then all of a sudden you're not entirely different.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.200]   There's a new way of thinking that you have to take on and adopt.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.920]   And I have the same experience with, uh, the, the place of being a professional
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.720]   financial advisor.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.360]   However, the other aspect of it is, as I've stated here on the show, as of a
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.760]   number of months ago, I can't remember the exact date.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.800]   I'm no longer invested in any publicly traded securities.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:39.360]   So at the moment, currently in August of 2015, all of my family's household
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.120]   investment accounts are in cash.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.120]   I don't own any bonds.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.960]   I don't own any stocks.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.840]   Everything is in cash as I've readjusted and reoriented my own personal
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   investment strategy.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.120]   And I don't intend to give on the show here, the blow by blow of exactly what
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.040]   I'm doing with my money and why, but I will give some big picture and try to
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.680]   share some, some lessons from that.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.720]   But what that means is that when I went ahead and sold a number of months ago,
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.760]   I've got money sitting on the sidelines.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:12.640]   So I can watch these gyrations in the market with a somewhat more dispassionate
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.520]   eye, which is interesting because since I was 18, I haven't been in that position.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.400]   I've had my money on the line every step of the way.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.320]   My point in sharing these things with you is just simply to say that it's, I
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.480]   have a unique perspective and I'm going to try to share some of that with you.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.560]   In addition to my own personal experience, I want to tell you just a
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.080]   little bit about systems of thought and schools of thought and how that also
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.480]   gives me a unique perspective.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.880]   I am personally intensely suspicious of mainstream thought.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.320]   I, any long time listener of the show is going to know that.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.600]   I'm very suspicious.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.960]   I'm very suspicious of propaganda.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.760]   I'm very suspicious of how societies are controlled, but I'm also
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.120]   trained in mainstream thinking.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:01.040]   So when I watch the different perspectives and I read people's opinions and
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.000]   philosophies on different sides, I can relate to most of them.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.040]   I can relate to the hardcore mainstream financial advisor on CNBC, and I can
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.720]   also relate to the hardcore conspiracy theorist on CNBC if they make it there.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.120]   So I can understand what's behind those.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.920]   And so what I'm going to try to do here is give you some ideas that are filtered
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.800]   through the fact that I understand where you might be coming from.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.680]   And I don't claim to be an expert.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.160]   I don't claim to have a crystal ball for the future, but I do have some
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.880]   observations that I believe will be helpful for you as you try to make sense
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.520]   of the things that are going on, specifically as you try to figure out,
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.640]   should you be making any changes in your own personal portfolio based upon
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.080]   the events of the last few days?
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.240]   That's my hope and my purpose, and you can let me know how I do.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:59.520]   First, I'd like to point out to you that the news engine, the
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.920]   news industry thrives on disaster.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.320]   This makes it very, very challenging to be able to make excellent decisions.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.400]   If you are at all connected to the news machinery, you're going to be
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:21.200]   influenced by the messages therein, whether that's mainstream news or
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.080]   whether that's just simply the internet news that comes out most of us through
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.640]   our Twitter feed or Facebook feed.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.880]   You're going to be influenced by what you see and times of disaster and times of
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.200]   crisis make for the best headlines.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.600]   Now, I can make some arguments that are going to put you into a panic.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.640]   I can talk about the ephemeral value of money, how the fact that our entire
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.440]   society is built on valueless paper money.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.560]   I can talk about the indicators of global collapse.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.680]   I can talk about the manipulation of the economy, and I can work you into a frenzy
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.920]   and say, "Well, it's time to sell everything and get gold coins and move to the
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.480]   mountains."
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.400]   But I can also flip it around and talk about why everything is great and why
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.840]   you should simply stay the course.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.080]   Both of those messages – and there are many more messages that could be done.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.240]   Both of those messages can be powerful because depending on your background,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.280]   they might feed a bias that you have.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.920]   If you're already inherently suspicious of government and political control of
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.760]   society, then when I talk about the fact that the whole financial world is very
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.000]   much a scam and that the whole idea of telling you as an investor to do nothing,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.200]   to stay investment, that's just part of the financial company fee assurance
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.480]   program to make sure that the investment management fees keep coming in.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.360]   Or if I talk with you about how you've got to stay invested, stay invested, and
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.160]   you say, "Well, wait a second.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.760]   Who's making money off of my staying invested until retirement?
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.840]   Why is all my money locked up?"
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.640]   That's going to feed a certain bias of you.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.600]   But if you are – if you have a perspective on the world where you say
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.560]   everything is going to be great no matter what, I'm just going to keep doing what
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.240]   I'm doing and I talk about staying the course, staying the course, and that's
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.000]   also going to feed a confirmation bias where you just want to continue on.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.480]   And so I want to just point out that the information that you expose yourself to
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.160]   is going to have an influence on your thinking.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.440]   You need to be very careful with the information that you expose yourself to.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:27.240]   With regard to the market, one thing I believe to be pretty much true is that
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.640]   all of the opinions that you hear about why people are buying and selling today
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.120]   in the markets are simply unfounded lies.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.440]   Nobody has a clue why people are buying and selling.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.200]   There are millions and millions and millions of people who are participating
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.240]   in the public securities markets and each one of them has their own individual
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.360]   perspective on why they're going to buy or why they're going to sell.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.600]   Remember that in times of market panic.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   Now it may be true indeed that various pieces of news might have an impact on
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.160]   the market, so China's markets might be changing and correcting and therefore
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   that's going to have an influence on the U.S.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:13.760]   stock markets.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.840]   That might be true, but that doesn't necessarily indicate what's going on on
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.320]   any moment to moment, day to day basis in the market.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.600]   So for example, you might have two traders and both of them have
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.920]   predicted this trade, but they've set themselves up in opposing positions,
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.600]   one to profit from the rise and one to profit from the fall in stock prices.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.240]   So people are making money both ways.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.200]   Professional traders make money on the upside and on the downside,
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.920]   depending on their perspective.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:48.040]   That is going to exert an influence on the market prices of stocks and those
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.040]   people are in the same market as the little old lady who just sits back and
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.880]   cashes her Coca-Cola dividend checks and then she dies and then her son or
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.400]   daughter as the executor or executrix of her estate feels the need to go ahead
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.560]   and sell those shares and that sale might be taking place on the same day for a
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.560]   totally different reason.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.480]   Multiply that times millions and millions of people and nobody has a clue why the
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.360]   markets are moving in a certain direction.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.640]   If you acknowledge that as being true in any sense, then it will make it very
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.800]   annoying to you to watch the news because what happens is that when you see
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.760]   somebody reporting on financial news, you can quickly see that people are mixing
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.120]   up their strategies and they might be reporting on here's what these
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.200]   professional traders from this company are doing and that's an accurate
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.720]   assessment.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.200]   But in the aggregate, the market is just simply a giant auction house and people
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.600]   are all buying and selling for their own different reasons.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.520]   When those things are shaking out in the short term, it's very difficult to
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.760]   pinpoint what's going on.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.000]   In the long term, you can pull back and look and get a broader assessment of the
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.320]   aggregate, but in the short term, it's very difficult to know what's actually
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:02.840]   going on.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:10.120]   The biggest lesson that I'd like you to take from this, from the last few days,
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.400]   is ask you a question.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.680]   Do you know what you own, why you own it, and what your plans are with it?
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.040]   If you do, then we'll know how to respond and that's where I'm going right now
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.960]   with some responses.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.760]   You need to know what you own, why you own it, and what the value is.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:36.480]   If you do that, then you won't be knocked off your feet by market movements like
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.520]   the last few days.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   This, I believe, is one of the fundamental problems with our modern
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.920]   investment culture.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.800]   We've taken the realm of investing from experienced professionals, pension fund
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:56.880]   managers, large corporate investors like insurance companies, and we moved it into
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.640]   the realm of everybody.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.120]   But there hasn't been a corresponding transfer of knowledge and experience and
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.600]   temperament from a professional investor to an individual investor.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.960]   One of the most damaging things, I believe, that has happened to many people's
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.000]   personal finances is instead of being enrolled in a professionally managed
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.160]   pension portfolio, now many people have a privately run 401(k) account.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.520]   And so with a press of a smartphone app or a click of a mouse, you can open up
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.440]   your 401(k) balance and you can see everything that's in there and you can
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.720]   buy and sell at a moment's notice.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.000]   If you haven't developed the education and the temperament to be able to respond
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.280]   to market conditions appropriately, that can be a death trap.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:45.920]   And statistics indicate and the analysis of the real life returns of many
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.760]   investors indicates that most investors simply don't have the temperament or the
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.440]   experience to be able to handle it.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.360]   So you need to be confident what you own and understand it.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.840]   Now, should you respond to the last few days of trading losses?
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.720]   And as I record this, right now it's 1.38 PM on August 25, 2015.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.760]   Lots of trading losses the last few days.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.680]   Today, the Dow is up 1.5%.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.000]   The S&P is up by a percent and a half.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.760]   So today they're trading gains.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.880]   Who knows?
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.000]   That's often to be expected after a day like yesterday.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.960]   But should you respond?
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.280]   That's the question that you might be asking.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.120]   My answer is yes, you should respond.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   You should take a look at what's been going on and then you should respond to
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.920]   the last few days of market activity.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   Now, those of you who are extremely astute will notice I didn't say how to
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.320]   respond.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.560]   So let's ask that question next.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.920]   How should you respond?
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.960]   Is Joshua Sheets going to tell you to buy stocks now that they're down?
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.640]   Or Joshua Sheets going to tell you to sell stocks now because this is the
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.520]   beginning of the end?
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.560]   Well, here's my answer.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.360]   Yes, you should respond to the market conditions and your response should be
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:12.680]   the exact precise response that is outlined in your written investment
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:18.600]   policy statement, which has been crafted based upon your overall investment
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.280]   strategy.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.840]   So you should open up your written investment policy statement.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.160]   You should take a look at the parameters, the goals, the decisions that you've
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.720]   made surrounding the portfolio and then you should respond as you previously
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.040]   planned to respond.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:39.280]   Frustrating, isn't it?
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.320]   But this is the difference between professional investors and amateur
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.000]   investors.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.920]   An amateur moves constantly based upon the whims of the moment.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.000]   This is how many people – this is interesting.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.760]   We also – I believe one of the major differences between people who are
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.960]   successful in life and people who are unsuccessful in life.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.480]   The amateur investor takes the news of the day and reacts to it.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.960]   That reaction is unpredictable because it's non-premeditated.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.720]   It's random.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.240]   It's based upon whatever the last little bit of information is that slid into
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.800]   that person's line of sight.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.600]   But a professional doesn't react.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.040]   A professional responds.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:28.280]   A professional investor has a clearly written investment objective.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.000]   Here is something that I am working to accomplish.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.640]   Then they have a clearly written investment strategic plan and they have
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.680]   parameters in that plan.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.280]   Now, that doesn't mean that they're not going to adjust in the moment.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.040]   There may be reasons to change the investment policy statement.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.000]   There may be reasons to change the plan.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.400]   But you don't do those things in reaction to what's going on.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.280]   You do them when it's appropriate to change the plan.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.760]   Let's compare this for sake of illustration to goal setting.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.040]   Let's talk about something like an exercise program.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.080]   An amateur like me goes out and exercises based upon how they feel on a given day.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.520]   Well, I feel like doing this today.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.120]   I feel like doing that today.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.760]   I feel like doing the other exercise.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.280]   Today I don't feel so much like this.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.680]   There's no – generally from many – most people who work out in a gym, there's no
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.840]   clear objective.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.680]   Most people aren't working towards a specific goal.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.960]   They're not working towards a specific athletic event.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   They're not working towards a specific biomarker that they're trying to improve,
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.160]   their weight, their body fat percentage.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.840]   They're just kind of working out because they know that they should exercise.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:42.000]   And so their results are random and their approach is random.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.160]   Some days they feel like running, so they run.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.240]   Some days they feel like lifting weights, so they lift weights.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.960]   But a professional doesn't do that.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.320]   A professional athlete has a clearly written objective.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.280]   I am going to compete in the Olympics.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.120]   I am going to compete in this weightlifting competition.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.000]   I'm going to compete in this bodybuilding competition.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   They have a clear objective for what they're trying to do.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.080]   They also have a clearly developed plan.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.240]   If they're training for a marathon, they have a marathon training schedule.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.120]   If they're working towards a specific weightlifting competition goal, they have a
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.960]   training schedule.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.800]   Now, within that training schedule, they have some flexibility.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.320]   So if they have a particularly heavy day on Monday and then they have a light day
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.520]   on Tuesday and they're supposed to have a heavy day on Wednesday, they come in on
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.560]   Wednesday and they really aren't feeling like lifting heavy that day.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.080]   They have a consultation with their coach and they sit down and they say, "I don't
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.480]   feel -- I just don't think we should do that."
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.000]   And the coach adjusts a few things.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.440]   But it's not random.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.520]   It's planned.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:46.320]   Now, look at the results that a professional athlete gets as compared to the results
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.520]   of an amateur athlete or even just an average person and compare those to
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.080]   investing.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:57.760]   If you're investing professionally, you're investing with a clear objective.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.480]   So that means that your portfolio has an objective.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.120]   For one portfolio, let's -- as an example, let's say that you're managing a trust
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:12.760]   account for a trust that is designated and your intention is this trust account is
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.080]   going to be transferred to your grandchildren.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.000]   Well, in that account, you now have -- let's say that I've done that.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.520]   I'm 30 years old and I'm thinking about my grandchildren.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.480]   So I've got a now 100-year time investing perspective.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.840]   If that's my goal for the funds, then I'm going to sit down and I'm going to create
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:41.200]   a strategy that I believe will help this trust fund to grow long-term with an eye
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.800]   on those 100-year returns.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.560]   Now, in light of that, this is why we talk so much about time horizon in
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.040]   investing.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.880]   In light of that 100-year goal, does it make any sense for me to change my
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.960]   portfolio based upon the market correction this week or next week?
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.960]   If I've got a 100-year time horizon, hopefully the investment strategy that
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.480]   I've outlined for myself is going to have taken that into account.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.640]   If not, I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.920]   Now, compare that to a fund that I've set aside and let's say I've shared on the
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.920]   show at some point I plan to take a year or two off and take my family and we're
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.720]   going to travel to all 50 state capitals.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.360]   It's going to be part of Joshua's home education plan of U.S.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.360]   American education to understand the U.S.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.080]   American culture.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.200]   We're going to take a year.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.880]   We're going to travel to all 50 state capitals.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.040]   Well, the funds that I've set aside for that, I definitely need to have a plan
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.960]   that's going to account for short-term market corrections.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.440]   If we were leaving on a trip next week, I'd be in trouble if that money was all
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.320]   sitting in a Dow Jones ETF.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.640]   But my response is going to be dictated by the strategic objective and the plan.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.960]   So the same thing should be the case with your portfolios.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:02.600]   Each portfolio should have a clear objective, a clear goal, and then a
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.120]   clearly written investment policy statement.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.520]   No professional invests without a written policy statement.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.840]   In fact, I could probably make that the difference between a professional and
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.320]   an amateur.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:23.040]   My point is you should respond based upon the plan that you've already
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.960]   established.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.840]   You should not react.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:33.440]   Now, what if you – what if all the – everything I've just said for the last
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.360]   10 minutes is going over your head because you don't have an objective, you
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.280]   don't have a clearly stated goal, you don't have an investment policy
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.120]   statement, you don't have a written plan.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.440]   What if all that is true?
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.000]   Well, my plea to you is don't do anything.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.120]   Don't start with saying, "Okay, I'm going to cash my investment accounts out.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.280]   I'm going to change these things.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   I'm going to go over why."
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.480]   But don't just react to this.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.640]   Rather, take this as a learning experience and start at what actually
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.600]   matters, which is building out an objective, creating a plan, and then
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.760]   implementing the plan in an intelligent way.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:14.320]   Now, let's talk about some responses to market – current market conditions.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.360]   I want to – and I want to illustrate to you how depending on your plan, your
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.760]   response will differ.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.760]   What you actually do will differ based upon your plan.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.200]   And I believe this will show some of the distinctions that there are among
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.560]   investors, but it will be broad enough that it will be applicable to many of you.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.600]   And I'm going to go over four major strategies.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.120]   Now, there are an infinite number of variations of each of these.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.040]   So for example, my first of the four that I'm going to cover is I'm just
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.640]   lumping it together as a short-term trading strategy.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.200]   We could talk about dozens and dozens and dozens of short-term trading strategies.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.440]   I'm just trying to teach you a framework for looking at things, not focus on the
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:55.960]   specifics.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.200]   But the four strategies I want to cover are what if you have a short-term
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.120]   trading strategy?
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.800]   What if you have a long-term single-stock ownership strategy?
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.880]   What if you're pursuing an active mutual fund ownership management strategy?
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.160]   Or what if you have a passive mutual fund management strategy?
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.640]   Now, I want to illustrate how your responses will vary dramatically
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.840]   depending on which of these strategies.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.720]   So let's start with a short-term trading strategy.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.040]   Now, this is obviously very nebulous.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.200]   What are we trading?
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.360]   You could be trading any number of things.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.240]   Here I'm just going to be talking big picture about stocks.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.840]   But you could be trading options.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.880]   You could be trading commodities.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.720]   You could be trading futures.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.640]   There are so many different markets that you could be trading and any of those
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.840]   markets could be moving independently.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:47.320]   So here I just want to emphasize the fact that your trading strategy is going to
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.840]   dictate your move.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.360]   And for some of you, the last few days could have been the most profitable days
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.200]   ever.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.520]   For some of you, they could have been the most destructive days.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:07.280]   Some strategies that you might pursue thrive on volatility.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.800]   Some strategies die on volatility.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.520]   You can put in place some options trades that are only in the money if markets
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.200]   stay flat.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.080]   You can put in place some trades that are only in the money if markets move and it
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.080]   doesn't matter which way they move.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:30.840]   That's a very specific segment of the trading population.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.600]   I'm not going to go any deeper into this.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.440]   But you're not the ones listening to this show for investment advice at least.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:44.920]   But I only mention it because to point out that many of you have been making a
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.200]   lot of money the last few days.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.360]   I should qualify the statement.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.480]   Some of you might have been making a lot of money the last few days if you've
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.360]   established your trades based upon volatility.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.560]   Most people are not pursuing a short-term trading strategy.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.760]   I mention it just to be fair.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.200]   But what about if you have a long-term ownership strategy?
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.840]   So simplistically, you're taking a long position with individual stocks.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.520]   Well, then here, your response to the gyrations of the market the last few days
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.920]   would be to ask yourself, "Has something fundamentally changed with the companies
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.880]   that you own?"
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.960]   That's a key question.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:27.920]   Because just because the market price of what the auction called the stock market
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.200]   says they're willing to pay – the infamous Mr. Market says he's willing to pay for
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.960]   your company.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.520]   Just because the market price has changed doesn't mean that anything
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   fundamentally has changed.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:45.040]   So you want to ask yourself the question, "Has anything fundamentally changed with
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.360]   one of the companies that I own?"
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.960]   This is the reason I short-circuited short-term trading strategies is that although
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.240]   I have a cursory interest in it, interest in strategies and I enjoy reading
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:00.880]   overviews of them, the nuts and bolts of trading strategies, short-term strategies
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.640]   do not appeal to my temperament.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.960]   So I like to interview people on the show from time to time about them, but they
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.440]   don't appeal to my temperament.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:12.400]   My temperament is most suited personally with long-term ownership of carefully
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.240]   chosen companies.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.800]   So this type of long-term going long on individual companies, this is most suited
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.600]   to my personal investment temperament.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.920]   So given that, the way that I'm going to approach it is I'm going to say, "Has
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.920]   something changed?"
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:33.280]   If something has changed, then I might want to buy or if something has changed, I
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   might want to sell.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.960]   Excuse me.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   I mixed that up.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   If I own a company, let's say I own Apple Computers, the most loved stock on
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.440]   Wall Street, I'm going to ask myself, "Has something fundamentally changed with
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:55.840]   Apple's business model, with their ability to earn money and create profits for
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   me?"
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.440]   Because ultimately, that's the only thing that a company is, is just simply
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.880]   something to generate cash for me to fund my lifestyle goals.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   If something has fundamentally changed for the negative, I might want to sell.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.320]   Now on the flip side, if something hasn't fundamentally changed, then when the
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.880]   market price goes down, that might give me an opportunity to want to buy.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.600]   Someone said that I own Apple Computer and I love owning Apple Computer.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.400]   I'm convinced that the fundamentals of the Apple Computer company are
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   incredibly strong.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.160]   Well, I turn around and the market price was destroyed.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.960]   Well, now it's a buying opportunity.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.080]   But you've got to know that based upon the fundamentals of the company.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.200]   Ideally, those trades were possibly already established in the sense that
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:45.280]   perhaps you'd collared your position and you had it ready to sell at a certain
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.160]   decline or you'd already established the fact that you want to buy more Apple
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.400]   Computer and you've got money sitting aside in your cash account and you're
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.280]   just waiting for a price but you knew that if Apple were to ever hit this
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.120]   price, then you'd be ready to buy in.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:07.560]   So that's how you respond based upon your strategy.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.320]   Those short-term and long-term strategies, the people who are involved on
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.240]   either side, usually they don't seem to mix much, at least the ones – the
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.000]   traders that I talk to.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.600]   Many traders can't even conceive of how they would own a company for weeks
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.200]   and months and some traders can't conceive of why they would ever pay any
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.720]   attention to the daily stock price or the weekly or even the monthly stock
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.720]   price.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.840]   They just read the annual report once – some investors read the annual
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.040]   report once a year.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   That's more my temperament is to read the annual report once a year and ask
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.520]   myself has something fundamentally changed.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.680]   But your strategy will dictate your response.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.280]   What about the strategies that most people in the United States are engaged
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.480]   in whether knowingly or unknowingly?
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.640]   Here I'm just simply thinking of the 401(k) accounts, the IRA accounts of
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.320]   most individual investors.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:58.440]   Well, here primarily you're going to be having mutual funds and those mutual
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.320]   funds are either going to be active or passively managed mutual funds.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.640]   So let's talk about what do you do if you have a portfolio of actively
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.160]   managed mutual funds, say within your 401(k).
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:14.400]   How do you respond to gyrations in the market?
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:21.960]   Very simply, you must do nothing and trust your managers.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.320]   This is the one that annoys me more than anything because people forget
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.000]   about the fact that if you've purchased a mutual fund, by definition you've
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.420]   hired a professional portfolio manager.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:37.480]   If you don't trust them to do their job, you should sell.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:44.160]   But if you trust them to do their job, do nothing because what happens is –
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:50.320]   this is actually a major contributor I think to market volatility is if you
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.440]   sell your mutual fund, your fund manager has to liquidate their underlying
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.320]   investments.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.680]   Mutual funds will keep a certain amount of cash on hand in order to handle
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.680]   redemptions.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.480]   But if all of a sudden many of their subscribers to the mutual fund
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.440]   start selling shares, then they have to go and they have to liquidate
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.440]   investments.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.520]   Don't put your mutual fund manager in the position where they've got to
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.440]   go and liquidate their investments when the market is down.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.520]   That's one of the more difficult aspects of managing a mutual fund,
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:23.400]   which is one of the reasons why many of the great investors and portfolio
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.800]   managers can be drawn to hedge funds because in a hedge fund, they can have
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.140]   a lockup period and they can make it so that you can't redeem your money.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.680]   That way, they can work their way through the times of market volatility.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.900]   But if you've chosen a portfolio of actively managed mutual funds and you
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:44.240]   just invest within your 401(k), trust your managers.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.480]   Do nothing.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.000]   What about the argument – I often hear this one that the managers are stuck
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.280]   in their asset class.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.540]   That's true.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.560]   So the argument goes like this.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.580]   And so when someone like me starts saying, "Trust your managers.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.580]   Do nothing.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.580]   Let them invest the money."
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.580]   That's what you hired them to do.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.320]   It's what you're paying them lots of money to do.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.440]   I say, "Well, don't you know that the fund manager can only invest in
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   large cap stocks?
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.440]   So even if they think large cap stocks are going to tank, they have to
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.960]   sell a certain number – excuse me.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.200]   They have to maintain a certain percentage of their portfolio in large
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   cap stocks."
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.560]   It's true, which means if that bothers you, you should have chosen a
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.840]   mutual fund that had a different investment strategy where the fund
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.180]   manager was given more leeway.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:32.880]   But if you chose that mutual fund, you chose them because you wanted
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.200]   your money invested in large cap stocks.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.760]   And so you should have read your prospectus and your prospectus says the
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.040]   restrictions that are on your manager and the manager is just simply doing
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.520]   the job for you.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.480]   And so ideally you've intelligently constructed a portfolio that's
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.880]   going to match your goals and if you're choosing an asset allocation
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.260]   strategy, you're saying that I don't know what the future holds.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.560]   So I always want 20% of my assets to be invested in large cap stocks
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:03.440]   and because of that, I want my fund manager to maintain their funds, at
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.340]   least 80% of their investable funds in large cap stocks.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.160]   If you want a fund manager who is going to be trading the account and
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.360]   saying, "We're getting out of large cap stocks and moving into small cap,"
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.280]   you should choose a different mutual fund and you should have chosen
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.520]   one.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.580]   But trust your mutual fund managers.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.240]   At the end – on the end of my outline today, I'm going to emphasize
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.760]   this point but I'll go ahead and say it here.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:37.080]   You are the small guy or gal in the world of investing.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:44.260]   You have no possible chance or hope of competing in the stock market and
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:49.020]   intelligently trading ahead as an individual layperson listening to this
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.020]   show.
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.820]   Don't think for an instant that you're going to be able to pull open
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.220]   your Fidelity app on your smartphone and you're going to see the stocks
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.660]   are going down and you're going to be able to intelligently trade your
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.660]   401(k) dollars out of the account.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:07.900]   You're not going to be able to say, "I'm going to move from my large cap
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.140]   US stock mutual fund into bonds right now because I'm going to predict
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.320]   the market gyrations."
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.800]   You don't have enough information.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   You don't have a plan.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.060]   You don't have enough expertise.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.380]   So the number one thing you can do in that situation is do nothing and
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.580]   trust your managers.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.340]   Now a tiny proportion of you get really annoyed when I say something like
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   that.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.780]   You're the portion who should change.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.620]   You should not buy mutual funds and you should go and manage your money.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.740]   But the vast majority of the listeners of this show, you have no possibility
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:47.860]   of competing effectively in this market which is why I encourage you,
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.180]   compete effectively in a market where you do have an outsized advantage.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.660]   Compete where you're the big dog.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.740]   That might mean in your company of salespeople, you become the key salesperson.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.420]   It might mean in your local real estate market, you compete there.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.580]   It might mean that you look around and notice that your city or town has a
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:08.020]   dearth of hot dog vendors and so you start a hot dog vending business.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:13.500]   But you're not going to compete in the mainstream US stock market.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.020]   So recognize that and trust your managers.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.060]   Let's move on to the fourth one.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.220]   I belabored that point a little bit too much but I just – I hate it.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:25.260]   I hate seeing it because what happens is so many people think, "Oh, I'm
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.460]   going to manage this fund in and out and I'm going to buy and sell my mutual
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.180]   funds within my 401(k)."
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.380]   You're not going to effectively do that.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.820]   Your only choice when you bought into that account and you invested through your
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:40.820]   401(k) and you chose a portfolio of mutual funds, in order for that strategy
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:46.780]   to work and it can and should work, you must trust your managers.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.660]   They're the ones who are looking at the underlying performance of Apple
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.460]   computer and saying, "We're going to bet on Dell because Dell is taking over
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.460]   from Apple."
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.140]   They're the ones who have investment research teams and what happens is you
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:03.620]   pay them all this money to do their job for you and they've carefully positioned
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:04.620]   the portfolio.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.940]   They've got all kinds of analysts that are out beating the streets
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:12.300]   and then you say, "Oh, the news is going on and the Dow is down 500 points.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.840]   So I'm going to go ahead and sell my funds."
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.800]   You destroy your strategy.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.460]   What if you've got passive funds?
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:27.340]   Let's say that you don't have an actively managed mutual fund where your portfolio
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.820]   manager is sending somebody out and they're going to this company and
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.300]   interviewing the management and they've got their researchers and they're
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.140]   having – you just bought some index funds.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:41.100]   Well, here again, recognize your strategy.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:46.020]   If you're pursuing this strategy, you are betting on the long-term growth of
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.200]   the US American and world economies.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.380]   You're betting on an efficient market and you're betting on your asset
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.020]   allocation strategy.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.340]   And so again, sit tight.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:05.100]   That strategy is predicated upon the long-term efficiency of the markets and
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:11.500]   what's happening in the last few days is that the markets are correcting to
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.980]   the proper appropriate valuations.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.300]   That's your strategy.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.380]   Now if you don't believe those things to be true, you're not betting on the
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.900]   long-term growth of the US American economy or the global economy.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.020]   If you're not betting on an efficient market, then you should change your
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.980]   strategy.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.180]   But don't do it in a panic and reaction to the last few days of market
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.500]   gyrations.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   So what practically can you do?
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:40.260]   Well, here the key is to maintain an appropriate asset allocation strategy.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:44.260]   I'm not just talking about managing what percentage should be in long-term
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.900]   large cap versus mid cap versus small cap.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.140]   I'm talking about in your life.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.940]   If all your money right now is in stocks and that's the extent of your net
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:01.400]   worth and then you get fired and you don't have any cash, you're screwed.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.300]   So that's why you keep cash on the side.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.060]   Don't have money invested that you're going to need in the short-term.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.020]   The five-year rule of don't invest the money – have any money invested that
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:16.540]   you think you might need in the next five years is a legitimate rule.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.980]   Think about – anytime there's a market crash, think about what five years of
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.380]   change can do.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:26.660]   If you go back, one of the most interesting things, if you go back to 1929
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.860]   and if you factor in and you look at what – if you had invested everything
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:36.340]   right before the crash of 1929, it takes – depending on which data set you look
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:41.380]   at, if you factor in the deflation of money and the dividend growth – excuse
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.320]   me, the dividends paid from stocks, the average investor in 1929 took just
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:51.020]   under five years to break even right through the Great Depression.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.700]   That's when you factor in dividends and deflation.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.340]   You can't just take the straight stock price.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.140]   It's much longer there.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.300]   But if you stay invested five years, you broke even through the Great
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.300]   Depression.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:07.060]   I only point that out because it's a little bit sensationalistic to – but
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:11.500]   it's an indication of look how much things can change in five years.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.220]   So if you've decided that you're going to need your entire portfolio
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:18.300]   tomorrow, then yes, you should sell and take it and run.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:24.580]   But if you're going to need your entire portfolio in 20 years, then you should
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:31.340]   sit tight and maintain your approach to your investment policy statement.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.020]   The only time that you change your investment approach is when your goals
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.940]   change.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.740]   So when I changed my personal investment approach, I did so over a long
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.500]   period of time because my goals changed.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.620]   My goals and my plan have changed from what they were five years ago.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.500]   So I waited for what I thought and guessed to be an intelligent time, period
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:58.500]   where markets were strong, prices felt high to me, didn't see a lot of
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:03.300]   upside, I vaguely timed the market, then I went ahead and sold because my
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.980]   goals had changed.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.740]   Your goals don't change when there's a five-day market correction.
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.980]   Your goals change when the long-term strategic objective changes and then
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.060]   you adjust the portfolio to fund that.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:21.100]   You have to remember that volatility is the price of the larger stock
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.260]   market returns that you get.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:28.420]   You only get the returns if you're willing to sit in for the volatility.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:33.540]   I didn't pull the statistics at my fingertips but these are fairly
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.540]   accurate.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.980]   I'm pretty accurate with numbers.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.500]   Someone can check me out and find the actual data and post it in the show
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.500]   notes if you want to.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.260]   But the average intra-year decline of the stock market is something
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.260]   like 14%.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.340]   It's like 10% to 15%.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.860]   I think the number that sticks out in my mind is 14%.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:54.220]   That means on any random year, you should expect the market value of your
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:59.780]   investments to wander up and down by about 14%.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.900]   Every three years, you should expect about a 33% drop.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:08.420]   So what you should always do with percentages in stocks is put them into
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.620]   your portfolio with regard to actual numbers, cold, hard numbers.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:17.380]   Let's say that you got a half a million bucks sitting in your 401(k).
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:23.940]   Well, about every few years, you should expect to see a 33% drop, which
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.620]   means that if you have a half a million bucks in your 401(k), it would be
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:35.420]   entirely normal to watch that account go down from $500,000 to $330,000 on
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.820]   your statements.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.500]   That's normal.
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:49.060]   If you're not willing to sit in with that, you ought to get out of stocks.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:54.140]   If your investment advisor isn't warning you that that is normal, you
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.940]   ought to find a new investment advisor.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.540]   That's the price that you pay to get the higher return to the markets.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:06.100]   Now, that is not comfortable for most people.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.100]   If it's not comfortable for you, get out and go somewhere where you can
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.660]   compete effectively where you're going to be comfortable.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:15.340]   This is one of the things that makes me angry when people just automatically
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:20.300]   recommend stocks for people and they don't hold open the idea that some
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.280]   other people might have a much better wealth-producing plan.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.860]   If you can't deal with a 33% drop just about every three years, you ought
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.780]   to go somewhere else.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.540]   You ought to buy some insurance contracts.
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:38.420]   You ought to build your own business and keep your money in cash.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.780]   You ought to go buy and sell rental properties.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.140]   You ought to go do something else.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:50.220]   But if you can't sit and watch your $500,000 portfolio drop to $330,000,
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.440]   you should not be in stocks.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   You should expect it.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.640]   If you go out in the long term, you should expect at some point in your
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.900]   lifetime, at least a few times over the average course of an investment
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.980]   lifetime, your portfolio to drop by half.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:10.580]   That is normal, which is why I've said on the show previously the primary
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:15.500]   job that I see of a good investment advisor is helping you to predict that
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.060]   and understand how it's going to feel when times are good.
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:22.780]   What happens is if you've never anticipated market declines like it
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.820]   happened in the last few days, you sit there wondering is the world coming
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.460]   apart.
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.780]   But if six months ago your investment advisor walked you through and said,
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.780]   "Hey, guess what?
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.260]   You got a million dollars sitting in this account or you got $100,000
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.260]   sitting in this account.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.900]   How are you going to feel?
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   What are you going to do if six months from now this portfolio
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.460]   drops by 30% or 40%?"
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.420]   Well, if you thought through it, back to war gaming, if you thought it
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.340]   through and you said, "Well, I'm not going to feel great, but as long as
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.180]   I've got $100,000 in cash sitting in a bank account, then I'm going to
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.180]   feel better.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.180]   Okay, I'm going to just make sure we got the $100,000 in the bank
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.180]   account."
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.540]   That's why financial planning is such a powerful tool for an investment
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:10.540]   advisor to be able to help divert attention from what is causing
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.020]   problems.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:16.900]   I hope some of this is useful to you.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:21.460]   It's difficult for me to do the type of show that I've just done, which is
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:31.340]   trying to give a broad overview because realistically, there's so much – I
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.700]   could argue from different strategies.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.740]   What happens is people have blinders because they just have their
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.980]   strategy.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.580]   Some people are of the mind that I'm going to make a little bit of
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:44.300]   profit every year and then the next year, I'm going to go ahead and once
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.980]   I've made my profit for the year, I'm going to pull back.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.140]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.620]   If that's your strategy, follow it.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.580]   So what often happens is with punditry, commentators try to talk to
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.140]   everyone all at once without zoning in and saying, "Here's who I'm
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.140]   talking to."
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.540]   If you are pursuing an active trading strategy, ignore the advice to
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:08.100]   sit tight and pursue your trading strategy.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:13.660]   But if you are like one of the mainstream, straightforward, average
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:18.180]   US Americans, just has some money in a 401(k), you've got to stick with
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.180]   your strategy.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:25.660]   You're doomed if you try to strike out on your own.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:33.380]   You've got to do your best to ignore market gyrations like this.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.820]   The good news is this.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.860]   Remember that for every seller, there's a buyer.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.860]   So some of you are going to be making a lot of money in these few days.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:47.300]   Remember that if the gloom and doom predictions of the future are right,
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:51.040]   the good news is you're stuck with everyone else.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.820]   Is the whole concept of stock investing illusory?
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.820]   Is it all fake?
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:01.620]   Well, if it is, you have no possible chance of out-competing it.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.060]   So you're just along for the ride with everyone else and you can benefit
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.020]   from the political control over the aggregate markets just like everyone
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.740]   else is going to.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.460]   Hopefully that will make a few of you feel a little bit better.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.380]   I sincerely hope that you have not been blindsided by the events of the
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.660]   last few days.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.300]   I've tried on this show up till now to emphasize to you the things that you
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.860]   can do to protect yourself.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:31.460]   I tried to bring you different positions and perspectives and I hope that you've
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.260]   been implementing the advice that I've been giving.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.060]   I don't – I don't intend – I don't plan this show ever become the type of
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:43.420]   day-to-day commentary of what you should do because I don't have a clue about
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.420]   what the future holds.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.460]   I don't have a clue.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:51.820]   But I do hope that this show is the type of content and education and
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:57.060]   information that you can use to position yourself so that no matter what the
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.540]   future holds, you can thrive and prosper.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:05.940]   I used to love when Jim Rohn would talk about the seasons of life.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.420]   Sometimes there's summer.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.900]   Sometimes there's fall.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:12.000]   Sometimes there's winter and sometimes there's spring.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.260]   The fundamental of economic analysis is the idea that there are cycles.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:20.380]   There are economic and business cycles and we'll go through them.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:26.820]   When I talked about recession a few months ago, my effort to say prepare for it, I
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.340]   think we'll be heading into recession in the future.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:35.620]   I'm not predicting whether that's this month or next month or next year.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.340]   I am saying prepare for it.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:45.180]   If you really get the deeper level focus of strategy, which is built around
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:53.580]   objectives, goals, plans, if you get that life planning strategy, then you can
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.300]   apply the specifics that are appropriate for you.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:02.700]   Remember that stocks are just simply one thing that you can own and buy and they
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.420]   do some things for you.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:09.620]   But basically all they do is they just print cash.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:14.460]   So you should be comparing their merits and their demerits with every other option and
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:19.820]   opportunity that you have.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:23.260]   Some of you are not well suited to the stock market.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:28.020]   If you're sweating over the last few days, that's probably you.
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.660]   It doesn't mean you're a bad person.
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:36.260]   It doesn't mean that you can't become comfortable with stocks.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:41.180]   But it might also mean that you should recognize that and build and pursue a different strategy.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.660]   So I won't belabor the point because I've emphasized that.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:51.580]   But to calm yourself in times of fluctuation, go back and look at the plan.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.820]   I'm not the oldest guy out there.
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.460]   I'm 30 years old.
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:51:00.600]   But I'll tell you, in my adult lifetime, I've seen so many times that the time to be looking
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.960]   at the plan is when you're in the middle and everything is going wrong.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.380]   That's why you plan.
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.740]   You lay out the vision.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.140]   You lay out the goal.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:12.340]   You lay out the action plan that you believe will get you towards that goal.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.060]   And then you work your way through it.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.740]   There's always a dip right when you're in the middle of the action plan.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:23.260]   But that's not the time to abandon the plan unless circumstances have significantly changed.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.820]   It is the time to assess the plan.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.820]   But it's not the time to abandon the plan.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:32.980]   The athlete who has a couple bad workouts is not doomed.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:40.280]   The athlete who abandons the plan and decides to do what they feel like probably is.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:46.100]   Please consider that carefully as you assess your strategy, assess your financial plan,
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:52.300]   and figure out what your response should be to recent market conditions.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.460]   Hope has been useful.
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.660]   It's always so challenging to do shows like this.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.140]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:03.300]   I had planned to do this last night before markets had rebounded.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.940]   Anyway, it's always challenging to do time-bound content.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:13.700]   But hopefully this content is timeless and I'm just simply building off of recent events.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.580]   Stay focused on your plans.
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.700]   Recognize that you can build wealth in good times and in bad.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.500]   And it really only matters a little bit.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.380]   It does affect your plan, but it only matters a little bit.
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.380]   Thank you all for listening today.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.620]   I've done my best for you today, but if it's a little bit choppy, forgive me.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:32.140]   I'll be back in the normal flow of show creation very soon.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:36.500]   I want to thank you to each and every one of you who over the last weeks and months,
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.540]   but specifically last week, has signed up as a Patreon supporter.
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.500]   That has been incredibly encouraging.
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.600]   As I've been away from the microphone for the last week, I get an email every time one
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.380]   of you signs up as a patron.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:56.260]   Right now we're up to 218 patrons, 218 individual patrons who are supporting the show.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.620]   I would love to get that number to 250.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.740]   The dollar amount is less important to me.
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.580]   Obviously, the dollar amount is what pays my bills.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:08.060]   But what I mean is it's less important to me than the aggregate number because it's
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:12.720]   a different type of person who listens to a show casually versus somebody who takes
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.540]   the time and the effort to go to a webpage, pull out their credit card, put it in and
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.740]   say, "I'm going to support Joshua at a certain level."
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.900]   For all of you who are supporting the show on Patreon, I have been neglectful of properly
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.620]   delivering the benefits there.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.620]   I apologize.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.780]   I've just been overwhelmed and I haven't been able to keep up with it.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:35.660]   It's high on my list as I get the house sold here and get the business fleshed out, as
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:37.100]   I get the business properly staffed.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:41.420]   It's very high on my list to do a much better job of delivering the benefits to you, the
