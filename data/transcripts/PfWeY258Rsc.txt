[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, back in October of last year, we looked at the shipwrecked faith.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Specifically, how do people make shipwreck of their faith? What causes it?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   And there in APJ 1849, Pastor John, you define the shipwrecked faith as a person who makes a beginning in the Christian life,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   but who drifts away as their heart increasingly prefers sin over Christ.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   It's a heart preference issue. The heart falls in love with riches, or the heart falls in love with this present world and its approval,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and so it rejects a good conscience and becomes defiled by the world's sin.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Basically, a shipwrecked faith is the heart's desires corrupted. You made that point in APJ 1849.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   But sometimes when we speak of the shipwrecked faith, we assume that this state is one of final undoing,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   like there's no hope of return, it's over, you shipwrecked, or you don't shipwreck,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and that leads to today's email from a listener named Jacob.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Pastor John, thank you for all your service and for your passion in the gospel.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   My question is this. Is there hope for those who have shipwrecked their faith?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I believe I've done this, as 1 Timothy 119 describes, happen to those who have rejected a good conscience.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I feel my communion with the Lord has been dry and blocked for almost six months now due to my personal sin.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Can a shipwrecked faith be undone?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I think it would be unbiblical and unwarranted and unhelpful for me to say to Jacob that he is beyond hope.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Those six months of sin and disobedience and distance from God are no sure sign that Jacob is beyond hope.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So, let me try to give five encouraging reasons from the Bible why I say this for Jacob's sake,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   especially and others, no doubt, who perhaps share his condition.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And then we'll close with a sober warning and a hopeful exhortation first.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Let's just pay attention to the context that he's referring to, 1 Timothy 119-20.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's a very hopeful context, not a despairing one when he talks about the shipwreck.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   He says, "Hold faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, the good conscience,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   some have made shipwreck of their faith, among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   whom I have handed over to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So, Paul knows these two men. He knows them, and he says that they've made shipwreck of their faith
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   by rejecting conscience and that he has handed them over to Satan.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But why? Why did he hand them over? It does not say he handed them over for final punishment.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It says he handed them over to Satan to "learn." Learn. The word is "piduo,"
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   which means to give instruction, to train, to discipline.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So he handed them over to be instructed, to be trained, to be disciplined.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   This is not a word for final judgment or damnation.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   This is a word for remediation, improvement, hope.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And supporting that interpretation that I just gave is the fact that there's one other place
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   in the writings of Paul where he speaks about people being handed over to Satan
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   because they've sinned in an egregious way. In 1 Corinthians 5.5, he says,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   "You are to deliver this man who's committed this terrible sexual sin,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of his flesh,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Again, the aim of handing him over to Satan is salvation, not damnation,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   which means that making shipwreck of your faith in 1 Timothy need not be final loss.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   There is hope for a turnaround. That's my hopeful argument number one.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Number two, why did Paul use the image of shipwreck?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Because he used so many other images for the destruction of faith or the damage of faith.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Why did he use that? They rejected conscience.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   They've chosen to live against their conscience in sin.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   They've therefore left the faith. At least it looks like they've left it.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And they've turned away. What did shipwreck mean in Paul's experience?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Well, he tells us. It's quite amazing.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I didn't quite realize this until thinking about it for this question.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Here's 2 Corinthians 11 25.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   "Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Three times I was shipwrecked."
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Are you kidding me? Three times I was shipwrecked.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Now that's before the one in the book of Acts.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   So we can say at least four.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   "Three times I was shipwrecked. A night and a day I was adrift at sea."
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Paul must have thought, "Good Lord, I've got to be persecuted in every city.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And every third time I get on a boat, you're going to make it go down?"
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   That's a lot of shipwrecks for a life as short as Paul's.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Paul had experienced three shipwrecks, even before the one in the book of Acts.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And one of them evidently left him drifting in the water,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   holding on to some wreckage for a day and a night before he was, what,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   picked up by some other boat or got to shore? I don't know.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Amazing. Three shipwrecks, as if it were not enough that he was persecuted everywhere
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and had every other manner of trouble.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   But here's the relevant thing for Jacob's question.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Shipwreck, in Paul's experience, did not mean death.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It didn't mean judgment and death.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It meant loss and suffering. It was not final, at least not in Paul's experience.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It wasn't final. Three times he had come through it alive.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   He knew people survived shipwrecks. He had. Three times.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So there's no warrant. There's no warrant to think that when it says shipwreck of faith
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   in 1 Timothy, he meant that's the end of faith.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It'll never come back. It can't survive.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It's not holding on for a day and a night in the water.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   No hope for Hymenaeus and Alexander. No hope for Jacob. No way.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   That's not what it implies necessarily.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   You can't argue that from the word shipwreck.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Third, one of the most beautiful sentences in Paul's letters is 2 Timothy 4.11,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   where he says to Timothy, "Luke alone is with me."
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   This is his last letter. He's soon to be killed.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   "Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   for he is very useful to me in ministry."
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   That's beautiful.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Now, I know that when John Mark left Paul and Barnabas
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   and refused to go on the missionary journey work, we are not told why.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   We were not told that it was a crisis of faith,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   like a little mini shipwreck or something like that.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   We're not told. We don't know why he turned back.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   What we do know is that Paul was really angry.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   He was so displeased by Mark's behavior, he refused, absolutely refused,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   at the expense of his own friendship with his close friend Barnabas,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   he refused to take John Mark with him on his second missionary journey.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Luke says it caused a sharp disagreement between Barnabas and Paul,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and Mark, I mean, picture this, Mark must have felt a deep sting
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   from the great apostle. I mean, picture it.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Your favorite leader Christian says, "I'm not going to work with you.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   You're a quitter." Oh, my goodness.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   What a shaming thing to happen to John Mark.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Now, that may be what Jacob feels right now in asking us this question.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   He feels like, "I've just so badly deserted like John Mark
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   that I could never be useful again."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   But the encouraging thing is that here at the end of Paul's life,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   either he or Mark, probably Mark, has changed.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Something's changed. Mark has become not just useful, but very useful.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Get Mark and bring him, Timothy, because he's very useful to me for ministry.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And I mention this simply to show that there have been
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and there can be now dramatic changes in people's lives
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   so that being rejected and useless can turn around and become accepted and useful.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So that's number three. Here's number four.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Picture the night that Peter denied the Lord Jesus three times.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Jesus had warned him that this was coming.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And Peter, instead of humbling himself with trembling and pleading for help,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   "Oh, don't let that happen to me, Jesus. Please don't let that happen to me."
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Instead, he was cocksure it would never happen.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   "I'm not going to deny you. I'm ready to die with you."
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And here's Luke's description of that final moment after the third denial of Peter.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   This is just so moving.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and the Lord turned and looked at Peter."
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   "Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And he went out and wept bitterly.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   "Surely this was a shipwreck, if ever there was one."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Three times. Three times he denies the Lord of glory
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   after three years of experiencing his glory and beauty and love and patience.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Three times in the hour of his greatest suffering and loneliness.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And Peter knew the Lord saw it.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   He saw it happen.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   It was just no question. Jesus knows what I've just done.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   He saw me and he knows what he's done.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And therefore, his guilt must have been horrible.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   The shame he must have felt as he wept must have been absolutely overwhelming.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And then, as we know from the Gospel of John,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   the Lord met him after the resurrection and three times, no accident,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   three times asked him, "Do you love me?"
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And after he heard yes, after each of those three times, he said,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   "Feed my sheep."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   "You're back, Peter. You're back."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Amazing. Absolutely amazing.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   The ship of faith wrecked. It really did.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But it didn't wreck utterly, not finally.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And Jesus welcomed him back.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And then my fifth statement that I said would be a sober warning
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and an exhortation of hope comes from Hebrews 12.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It's about Esau.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It says, "Let no one be sexually immoral or unholy like Esau,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   who sold his birthright for a single meal.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   he was rejected."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Let me say that again because that's sober.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   "You know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   he was rejected.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   For he found no place of repentance,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   though he sought it, namely repentance, with tears."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And here's the sober warning.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   It is possible to make shipwreck of your faith like Esau
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and never be saved.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   That's a sober warning.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   But here's the hopeful truth and my exhortation.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   The text does not say, "Even though he repented,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   God withheld the blessing."
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   That's not what it says.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It says, "He sought repentance with tears, and he couldn't find it,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   couldn't do it."
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   This is the final shipwreck from which there is no salvation.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   We sin so long or so deeply that we can't repent.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   We can't.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Our hearts have become too hard.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   But the hope is obvious, right?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   It's obvious if you repent.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   If by God's grace you can turn and renounce your sin and come to Christ
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and take him afresh as your Savior and Lord and treasure,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   he will receive you.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   All who call upon the name of the Lord will be saved.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   So the exhortation, Jacob, is, and every other person listening
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   in Jacob's situation, "Come to Christ.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Come back.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   If you can come, he will have you."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Amen.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Yeah, a lot of angles on this from Scripture.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Every third time Paul sailed, he was shipwrecked at least four times in a lifetime.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   That's an incredible thought.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Paul survived all four of them.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Amazing protection, but very illuminating on shipwrecks and whether or not final
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   in Paul's mind as well.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And thank you for joining us today.

[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Well, can you guess who God loves more than anyone else in the universe?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   God most loves God.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   And this glorious fact is for us really the greatest news in the universe.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   In fact, until we understand this point, the good news itself, the gospel,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   will never make sense to us.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Justification won't make sense to us.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Pastor John will explain why on Wednesday.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   We'll see you next time.
