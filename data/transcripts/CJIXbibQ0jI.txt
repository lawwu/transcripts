[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.200]   for everyday life.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.760]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.760]   School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.520]   Today, we are discussing tools for mood and mental health.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.220]   I will include tools and resources taken from the guest episode that I did with Dr. Lisa
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.860]   Feldman Barrett, who is a psychologist and neuroscientist whose laboratory focuses on
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.600]   mood and emotions.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.660]   During that episode, she mentioned several important tools that I do believe everybody
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.020]   should apply and that indeed I've been applying to my own life and have found to be extremely
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.320]   beneficial.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.960]   I will also highlight some of the specific research articles those tools are based on,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.440]   which were not covered in the podcast with Lisa.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.040]   I will also discuss tools gleaned from the four-episode series that I did on mental health
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.760]   with Dr. Paul Conte, who is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.040]   And that episode, as some of you may already know, focused on mental health and the self
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.720]   as well as relationships.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.200]   And it included a deep discussion of what is the self.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.160]   We talked about the unconscious mind and the conscious mind.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.400]   And we also covered a lot of tools for understanding oneself, both within the context of therapy,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.660]   but also within the context of things that one can do alone and that require zero cost.
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.260]   In addition, we talked about tools for improving relationships.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.160]   We talked about first principles of self-care.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.360]   So I will provide highlights and takeaways of those tools during today's episode.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.100]   And thirdly, I will include tools, what we often refer to as protocols gleaned from some
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.840]   recent publications, indeed publications that came out as recently as two weeks ago, which
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.220]   really emphasize specific things that we can all do that again are zero cost that have
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.580]   been shown in quality peer reviewed research to significantly improve mood and mental health.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.140]   For instance, if you are a regular listener of this podcast, you are probably familiar
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.060]   with my nearly constant reminder that people should view morning sunlight and afternoon
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.060]   sunlight.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.480]   And if you can't to embrace some alternatives, like looking at bright artificial light, although
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.140]   sunlight is best, well, there was a recent paper published in the journal, nature, mental
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.380]   health, an excellent journal focusing on not just the positive effects of viewing light
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.380]   at those times of day and indeed throughout the day, but also the independent and positive
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.420]   effects of being in darkness for six to eight hours every night.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.420]   That's right.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.260]   Not only is light during the day correlated with significantly improved mental health
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.180]   outcomes, but darkness at night that is avoiding lights, not just bright lights, but lights
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.240]   for up to eight hours at certain periods of your 24 hour circadian cycle has been correlated
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.900]   with improved mental health outcomes and indeed has been shown to significantly offset certain
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.160]   negative mental health outcomes.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.860]   This is a spectacular study.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.380]   Again, it involved an enormous number of research subjects, more than 85,000 research subjects,
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.740]   and it touches on a large number of actionable protocols that I've distilled down to just
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.460]   one or two things that all of us can easily do to improve our mood and mental health on
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.220]   a consistent basis.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.620]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.500]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.120]   about science and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.040]   In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.180]   Our first sponsor is Plunge.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.860]   Plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile at-home self-cooling cold plunge for deliberate
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.860]   cold exposure.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.100]   I've covered the topic of deliberate cold exposure several times on this podcast.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.580]   Indeed, we did an entire episode about deliberate cold exposure.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.860]   And what's very clear from the research literature is that deliberate cold exposure can induce
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.680]   dramatic positive shifts in so-called catecholamines, that is dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.080]   This is a small collection of molecules that are released in the brain and body when we
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.040]   do deliberate cold exposure and that subjectively lead to greatly enhanced feelings of mood,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.180]   alertness, and focus for many hours afterwards.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.580]   That's perhaps the best substantiated reason and the most popular reason why people who
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.880]   get into deliberate cold exposure, no pun intended, continue to do deliberate cold exposure
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.520]   on a consistent basis.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.000]   Plunge uses a powerful and very easy to use cooling, filtration, and sanitation unit to
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.860]   give you access to deliberate cold exposure in clean water whenever you want.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.960]   I've used a plunge for several years now, and I really like it because first of all,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.520]   it can use a standard outlet.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.920]   You don't have to modify the electricity in your home or yard, and it's very easy to clean.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.320]   In fact, it stays clean for long periods of time, which makes it very easy to maintain
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320]   as well.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.100]   Plunge has several different models to select from, including their new all-in cold plunge,
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.760]   which offers faster cooling, smartphone connectivity, and more.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.200]   If you're interested in getting a plunge, you can go to Plunge, spelled P-L-U-N-G-E,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.740]   dot com slash Huberman to get $150 off your cold plunge.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.160]   Again, that's plunge.com/huberman to get $150 off.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.020]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.500]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.620]   Spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep, that is getting enough
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.140]   quality sleep on a consistent basis, is the foundation of mental health, physical health,
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.140]   and performance.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.260]   Now, one of the key things to getting the best possible night's sleep is to control
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260]   the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.500]   That's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature needs to drop
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.620]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.140]   In order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.860]   has to increase by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.260]   With Eight Sleep, controlling the temperature of your sleeping environment is made extremely
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.260]   easy.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.700]   Eight Sleep mattress covers allow you to program the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.900]   at the beginning, middle, and end of your night.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.100]   It can even divide the temperature on the two sides of the bed for different people.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.420]   It also has sleep tracking capacity.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.060]   It will tell you how much slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.620]   and really help you dial in the exact parameters so you can get the best possible night's sleep.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.140]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for well over two years now, and it
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.300]   has significantly improved my sleep and therefore my daytime mood, focus, and alertness.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.540]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman and save up
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.580]   to $150 off their pod three covers.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.340]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.460]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.940]   Waking Up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.700]   trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocols.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.060]   I started using the Waking Up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:50.300]   meditation since my teens, and I started doing yoga nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.660]   to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the Waking Up app, which could teach
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.140]   you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.200]   to place the brain and body into different states, and that he liked it very much.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.900]   So I gave the Waking Up app a try, and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.960]   I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate, and indeed
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.460]   I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.540]   levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.720]   of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.540]   I also love that the Waking Up app has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.020]   For those of you who don't know, yoga nidra is a process of lying very still, but keeping
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.020]   an active mind.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.440]   It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.240]   that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non-sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.060]   restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short 10-minute session.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.260]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app, you can go to wakingup.com/huberman and access
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.040]   a free 30-day trial.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.000]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman to access a free 30-day trial.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.360]   Okay, let's talk about tools for improving mood and mental health.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:10.140]   I think it goes without saying that these are extremely important topics for everyone,
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.180]   not just to know about, but in my opinion, also for people to implement.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.900]   And the reason is that we are currently in a worldwide mental health crisis.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.160]   And while we could debate the reason why we are in a worldwide mental health crisis, it's
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.920]   very, very clear that mood disorders and challenges with mental health abound.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.320]   And of course, there are many different therapies for the treatment of mood disorders and mental
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   health.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:40.140]   Everything from talk therapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist or social worker, prescription
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.240]   drug treatments, their nutritional approaches, somatic approaches.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.220]   And I want to be clear that I do believe that there's value in all of these approaches.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:54.800]   What tends to matter in terms of what sorts of tools and approaches one adopts includes
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   both access.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.160]   So whether or not people have access to these types of therapies, whether or not they can
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.080]   afford them on a consistent basis.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.740]   And also, of course, the severity of the mood or mental health disorder.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.160]   And I'd be remiss, of course, if I didn't make the statement, and I don't say this just
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   to protect me.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.300]   I also say this to protect all of you and those that you know, that if you are concerned
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.280]   about yourself or somebody else, having a serious mood or mental health disorder, please
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.400]   do seek out help from a licensed clinical psychologist or psychiatrist or other healthcare
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.220]   professional who's qualified to help you in that regard.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.900]   With that said, we can now have a discussion about tools and protocols for enhancing mood
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.380]   and mental health that truly apply to everybody regardless of age.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.680]   To start off, I want to talk about a fundamental aspect of mood and mental health enhancement
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.020]   that was discussed both in the guest episode with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, as well as
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.840]   in the guest series with Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:53.460]   And that has to do with what Dr. Paul Conte referred to as the first principles of self-care
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.460]   or mental health.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.140]   The first principles of self-care include, but are not limited to taking excellent care
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.800]   of one's biology, which of course includes both the mind and the body.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.400]   And in order to make this very simple and actionable, I've distilled out what I referred
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.420]   to as the big six.
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.280]   I've sometimes referred to these as the six major pillars of health, both mental health
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.580]   and physical health, as well as performance for that matter.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.200]   But if we're going to talk about tools for mood and mental health, we absolutely can't
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.400]   discard discussions about our biology.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.180]   That is, we need to make sure that we're taking care of our normal biological function and
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:37.140]   indeed enhancing the production of specific neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.140]   we are optimizing.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.520]   Yes, I use the word optimizing, the function of our so-called autonomic nervous system,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.360]   that aspect of our nervous system that's humming in the background all the time, it's operating
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.840]   unconsciously to regulate our sleep-wake cycles.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.860]   It's regulating how well or poorly we react to things.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.280]   It's regulating how much dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, acetylcholine we're producing.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.960]   All of this stuff is humming in the background and sets the stage for all the conscious work
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.780]   that we might put to, for instance, trying to understand what our life narrative is,
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.400]   what our unconscious mind is doing, what sorts of defenses am I producing, all of the sort
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.520]   of high-level and directed work that we're going to talk about a little bit later, exists
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:27.040]   on a background of autonomic function, of neurotransmitter production, of hormone production,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.540]   not just testosterone and estrogen, but things like cortisol, prolactin, and on and on.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:36.520]   So it's important to understand that if our goal is to be in the best possible mood, given
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:42.220]   our life circumstances, and to have the best possible mental health, given our life circumstances,
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.440]   and to improve our mood and mental health consistently over time, that we have to pay
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:52.240]   attention to what I'm referring to here as the big six, or the six pillars of mental
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   health.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.640]   And those are, just to list them off, then I'll go into a little bit more detail, sleep,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.380]   sunlight, although I'd like to modify sunlight because based on some new data that just came
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:09.760]   out a couple of weeks ago, I'd like to now make that second pillar, not sunlight, but
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   light/dark.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.480]   So we could even just think about it as light, when and how much light you get.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.780]   But what you'll soon learn is that how much dark you get is also extremely important.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:28.200]   So we've got sleep, light, movement is the third, nutrition, social connection, and stress
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   control.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.620]   Now, these are topics that I've spoken about extensively on previous Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.620]   episodes.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.960]   So I don't want to go into a deep dive of each of these six pillars right now, but I
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.660]   am going to just give you a few highlights of each.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.800]   And then of course, we will provide links in the show note captions for which you can
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.600]   go on the deep dive if you like.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.480]   And I also would like to mention that if you ever have questions about specific protocols
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.360]   or tools, and you're seeking those out or previous episodes, or specific timestamps
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.000]   of previous episodes of this podcast, you can go to our newly revamped HubermanLab.com
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.800]   website and put any topic of interest or even several topics of interest into the search
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   function.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.980]   And it will take you to the very specific timestamps and other resources that provide
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.880]   information on those topics.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.240]   So I'm going to go into a few of the key bullet points about each of the six pillars, or what
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.280]   I also refer to as the big six of self-care and mental health.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.520]   Again, this is a necessary list, but it is not sufficient.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:31.680]   Again, necessary to do these things every 24 hours, indeed every 24 hours, if you want
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.120]   to have the best possible mood and mental health, but it is not sufficient.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.280]   That means you still need to do some of the other things that we're going to talk about
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.300]   in terms of directed approaches at improving mood and mental health.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:50.400]   If you are to "optimize" your mood and mental health, or if you are, let's just say, trying
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.700]   to constantly improve your mood and mental health.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.760]   But these are the necessary, but not sufficient pillars of mental health.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.100]   So under the heading of sleep, it's safe to say that most people need between six to eight
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.060]   hours of sleep per night.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.800]   Some people can get away with five.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.240]   Some people need as much as nine or 10.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.700]   Certainly growing kids, babies, teenagers, and those that are suffering from some sort
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.960]   of illness are going to need more, as much as nine, 10, maybe even 12 hours of sleep
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.960]   per night.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.080]   However, most people do well to get somewhere between six and eight hours of sleep per night.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.780]   You're just going to have to experiment and figure out what's best for you.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.520]   Now one thing I heard recently, so I can't claim this as an original idea, but that I
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.160]   think is a really good way to think about sleep, is that sleep, much like physical fitness,
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.000]   is something that we have to constantly be working on.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.040]   It's not the sort of thing where you can get a great night's sleep one night and then the
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.440]   next night just kind of let all the protocols go and expect to get a great night's sleep.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.000]   You don't have to be neurotic about getting a great night's sleep.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.800]   Indeed, I do believe that we should strive to get enough quality sleep as many of the
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.400]   nights of our life as possible, and if you can't do that, hopefully it's for good reasons.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.660]   But of course, things happen in life, raising kids, you have emergencies, all-nighters to
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.960]   study so you can make sure you get the best possible grade on an exam, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.280]   But we should all strive to get the best quality sleep that we can and as much of it most nights
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.440]   of our lives.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.080]   So it's important to look at sleep as a process that you're going to be working on for the
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.960]   rest of your life, just like fitness.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.360]   And I don't say that to overwhelm you.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.100]   I say that so that if on any given night you get a poor night's sleep, you don't stress
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.580]   that too much, you just get right back on the wagon and you try and get the best possible
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.920]   night's sleep the next night and the next night and the next night, much like fitness.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.720]   There's no 10-week program that's going to transform your physical fitness forever, okay?
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   Just like there's no sleep program that's going to transform your sleep forever.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.360]   It's a daily or rather I should say nightly investment, although some of the things that
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.680]   are going to positively impact your sleep or perhaps damage your sleep are things that
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.000]   you do during the daytime, right?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   So avoid that caffeine too late in the day, get that morning sunlight and on and on.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.600]   But view sleep as something that you're constantly investing in and it is a critical investment
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.320]   for your mood and mental health.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.360]   The other thing that's not often discussed and I really haven't talked about terribly
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.580]   much on this podcast is the importance of having a fairly consistent sleep routine.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.900]   Now I realize that not everybody can get to sleep at the exact same time each night and
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.100]   wake up at the exact same time each morning and frankly, that's not practical.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.720]   I certainly don't do that.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.260]   However, what we know from the circadian health literature is that everybody should strive,
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.600]   again, that's strive, nobody's perfect, but strive to get to sleep at more or less the
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.520]   same time each night and wake up at more or less the same time each morning.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.540]   This turns out to be really important for regulating mood and mental health and indeed
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:48.080]   for improving your overall levels of sleep, getting the optimal amounts of slow wave sleep,
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.800]   AKA deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.940]   And what we know is that ideally you're going to get to sleep within plus or minus one hour
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.320]   of your regular sleep time.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.040]   So if your regular two bed time is 10 o'clock, you're used to getting in bed at 10 o'clock
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.700]   and falling asleep somewhere around 10 30.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.840]   Well then if the next night you fall asleep at 9 30, great, you're still within the plus
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.160]   or minus one hour.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.480]   And if the next night you go to sleep and you don't fall asleep till 11 30, don't sweat
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.480]   it.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.360]   In fact, you're still within that plus or minus one hour.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.960]   However, if you start getting into a habit of going to bed at vastly different times,
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.560]   deviating more than or less than one hour from your normal to bedtime, well then you're
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.260]   going to start to run into issues such as waking up feeling groggy, even if you've got
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.260]   enough sleep.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.380]   So even if you slept the full eight hours that you're used to getting, people who go
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.940]   to sleep much later than they normally do or much earlier than they normally do start
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.720]   getting into kind of issues of mood regulation, energy regulation, not just in the morning,
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.120]   but in the afternoon, likewise, try and wake up at more or less the same time each morning,
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.720]   plus or minus one hour.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.060]   That's really going to help you anchor your overall sleep schedule.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.680]   And it's really going to help lead to predictability of your overall levels of energy, mood and
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.120]   focus throughout the day.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.040]   The second pillar in that big six is light.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.400]   And I used to refer to this as sunlight, right, I'd say, and I'm going to say it again now,
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.000]   although I've covered this in a lot more detail.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.400]   So again, just hitting the top contour critical elements, try to view sunlight, that is with
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.840]   your eyes view sunlight as early as possible after waking.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.920]   Whenever I say that the most common question I get is what do I do if I wake up before
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   the sun comes out?
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.480]   Well, unless you have superpowers that I'm not aware of, you can't make the sun come
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.580]   out any earlier.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:34.640]   So just flip on artificial lights as needed until the sun comes out and then get outside,
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:40.120]   face east in the morning, take off those sunglasses, it's perfectly safe to look at low solar angle
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.340]   sunlight without sunglasses, providing you're not driving into bright light and you crash,
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.340]   this kind of thing.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.920]   Get outside, look at the sunlight, definitely blink to protect your eyes as needed.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.560]   But get that sunlight in your eyes early in the day.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.800]   This has myriad positive effects on mood focus and alertness and nighttime sleep later that
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.840]   night.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.140]   And it does so through a number of well-defined biological and endocrine hormonal pathways
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.560]   that I've discussed on many previous podcast episodes.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:13.080]   And you want to do this for about 10 minutes on non-overcast days and as long as 20 or
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.420]   30 minutes on overcast days.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.900]   And that highlights the second most common question I get, which is what do I do if there's
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.060]   no sun where I live?
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.160]   I live in an area where there's no sunlight.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.680]   Look, if you live on planet earth, there's always sunlight.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.860]   There might not be very much of it that might be very overcast where you live.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.160]   It might seem very dark, but trust me, there's far more photons, light energy coming through
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:39.820]   that cloud cover, even in the darkest mornings of winter than there are at night in those
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.880]   dark winters.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.660]   So get that light in your eyes and do it as consistently as possible.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.180]   And also do that in the late afternoon and evening.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.760]   That's critical for regulating your circadian clock for reasons that I've talked about previously,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.360]   but I'll get into in a future podcast, really explaining how those clock oscillators and
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.700]   mechanisms work, but just to keep it really simple, since this is a toolkit episode for
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.860]   your mood and mental health, your mood and your mental health will benefit tremendously
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.940]   from getting morning sunlight in your eyes.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.080]   Now, if you need to get more light in your eyes, because indeed there's just not enough
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.640]   sunlight or you don't have the opportunity to get outside and view sunlight in the morning
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:21.560]   for whatever reason, you might invest in getting a bright light source that you can plug in.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.840]   You probably want one that's as bright as 10,000 lux.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.440]   So that's pretty bright.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.640]   Those fall under the category of so-called SAD lamps, S-A-D, seasonal affective disorder
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640]   lamps.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.640]   And you can purchase those.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.240]   They can be somewhat expensive.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.160]   You can also opt to get a 900 lux drawing tablet, by the way, I have no financial relationship
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.120]   to any of these sorts of light sources, but you can find them pretty easily.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.440]   And in the case of the 900 lux light tablet, fairly inexpensively online, and you can put
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.080]   that on your desk or where you have your morning coffee and try and enhance the total amount
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.280]   of light that you're getting in the morning.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.800]   But frankly, nothing is as good as sunlight.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.760]   So if you can't get sunlight, you might think about investing in one of those SAD lamps.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.340]   And indeed those SAD lamps aren't as good as sunlight, but they are the next best thing
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.240]   if you really can't get sunlight on a consistent basis.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   A few other fine points that I always get asked about, first of all, it is absolutely
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.480]   okay to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.420]   Those sorts of corrective lenses are actually going to focus the light to your retina, which
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.800]   is where you want it.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:25.200]   However, this whole process of viewing morning sunlight and afternoon light does not, again,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.920]   does not work through a window or windshield because windows and windshields filter out
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.980]   the relevant wavelengths of light that you want to get directly onto your retina, okay?
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.840]   So that's the reality of it.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.440]   In addition, please don't feel that you have to look directly at the sun and certainly
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.400]   don't stare at the sun.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.720]   Never force yourself to look at any light, sunlight or otherwise that's so bright that
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.500]   it's painful to look at.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.920]   So if it's comfortable for you to look directly at the sun and just blink every once in a
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.800]   while, and you can do that without any pain or discomfort or watering of the eyes, please
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.800]   do that.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.420]   There's a lot of photons into your eyes and they're transmitting that to your brain and
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.880]   your brain to the rest of your body and on and on.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.520]   However, if you find it uncomfortable to look directly at the sun, in that case, what you'll
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.000]   want to do is offset your gaze to, you know, 10 or 20 degrees, which is nerd speak for
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.120]   just a little bit to the right or a little bit to the left and get the sunlight into
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.620]   your eyes indirectly, okay?
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.280]   And I often also get asked, well, can I stand in the shade while I do this?
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.660]   What if I have an overhang in my apartment?
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.040]   The best thing is of course going to be to face directly to the sun and look either directly
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.620]   at it or slightly offset.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.680]   But if you can only get morning sunlight by going out onto your balcony and your balcony
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.620]   doesn't face east, rather it faces west, you'll still get a lot of photons from the sun reaching
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.620]   your eyes there.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.980]   But ideally you would find some way to look toward the sun first thing in the morning.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.900]   I realized that with kids and work and other obligations, this can be challenging, but
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:52.320]   it is a challenge worth meeting, meaning don't lose your job or forget to take care of your
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.440]   kids to do this, but you can bring your kids to do this.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.360]   And indeed you should, it sets their circadian rhythms also.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.700]   And people often will ask, well, does it work on dogs?
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.760]   You know, indeed dogs and other animals have these exact same circuits and pathways for
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.280]   setting their circadian rhythm.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.720]   So it's great for them too.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.240]   Now there are also clear and documented benefits for mood and mental health to getting bright
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.500]   light in your eyes, ideally from sunlight throughout the day, as much as you safely
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.500]   can.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.980]   Please don't get sunburned, don't get cataracts by getting too much sunlight, but getting
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.580]   outdoors and getting sunlight in your eyes during your lunch break or a walk here and
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.740]   there, or if you have to remain indoors during the day, getting the lights in that environment
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:37.180]   as bright as possible, as is safely possible I should say, is known to improve mood and
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.180]   mental health.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.180]   Why?
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.960]   Because there's a special so-called opsin within the cells of your eyes called melanopsin
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.200]   that doesn't respond to the same differences in color that are present in sunlight in the
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.640]   morning and the evening, but rather responds to the overall brightness of light.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.000]   So very bright lights, either from artificial sources or ideally from sunlight activate
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.200]   these cells and these cells project these little wires we call axons into specific parts
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.080]   of the brain that improve your mood and feelings of wellbeing.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.820]   So I can't give you a specific number of five minutes a day or 10 minutes a day.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.260]   Just get as much light in your eyes, ideally from sunlight throughout the day, as is safe
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.000]   for you, meaning where you're not getting sunburned and you're not damaging your retina.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.640]   And if you want to know if you're damaging your retina, well, anytime you have to blink
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.260]   or turn away from light because it's really bright, that's a signal that the light is
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.260]   too bright.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.480]   So while you want to place yourself into bright environments, you don't want to place yourself
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.540]   into any environment so bright that it's painful to be in.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.500]   Okay, so use that as a metric and you should be just fine.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.780]   And the last point about light for mood and mental health is a relatively recent theme
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.820]   that's emerging from the scientific literature and that really was driven home by a recent
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.300]   study that I mentioned a little bit earlier in the episode.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.260]   This is the study published in Nature Mental Health showing that darkness during a particular
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:25:00.780]   stage of your 24 hour cycle, your so-called circadian rhythm is also very beneficial for
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.400]   mood and mental health.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.180]   And it's beneficial for mood and mental health in a way that is independent from light and
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.180]   from sleep.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.180]   Now, what do I mean by that?
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.840]   Okay, well, there are a number of different ways that this can be examined, but in this
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.620]   particular study, which I like oh so much, entitled day and night light exposure are
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:24.720]   associated with psychiatric disorders and objective light study in more than 85,000
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.080]   people.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:32.040]   What the researchers did is they analyzed how much light and or dark people were getting
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.220]   across the 24 hour cycle and correlated that with mental health outcomes, looking at a
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.300]   range of different mental health challenges, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.060]   depression, PTSD, and much more.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.220]   And I'll go into this study in a lot of detail in a future episode, 'cause it's such an important
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.260]   study with so many gems within it that we should all know about.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:56.580]   But one of the key things from this study is that the positive effects of daytime sunlight
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:03.700]   exposure and the positive effects of nighttime dark exposure, that means of course the absence
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.420]   of light, are independent of one another.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:13.580]   Put differently, making sure that you are in very dim to completely dark environments
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:20.400]   for a continuous six to eight hours within every 24 hours circadian cycle is correlated
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.120]   with much better mental health outcomes.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.440]   In other words, we shouldn't just think about the presence of light in the morning and throughout
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.220]   the day as positive for mental health.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   That's all true.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.220]   It's absolutely true.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.780]   And this study further verifies that, but that's been known for some time, indeed decades
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.500]   from the scientific research.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.820]   And of course it's been known for thousands of years intuitively and subjectively without
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.480]   detailed scientific measurement.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:52.200]   But in addition to that, this study shows that people who stay in very dim to dark environments
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.760]   for eight hours every 24 hours, or I should say approximately eight hours in every 24
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.680]   hour cycle, they benefit from improved mood and mental health outcomes in a way that's
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.340]   independent of how much light they're getting and independent of how much sleep they are
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.340]   getting.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.300]   The point is this, the time when you wake up, consider that time zero.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:19.300]   And then about, again, you don't have to be super strict about this, about 16 to 24 hours
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:24.760]   after that wake-up time, you should be in a very dim to dark environment for that 16
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.720]   hour to 24 hour period after waking up, okay?
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   What do I mean by this?
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:36.160]   I mean, if you go to sleep at 10 PM and you wake up at 6 AM, well that 10 PM to 6 AM phase
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.260]   of your circadian cycle, you should be in very dim light or entirely dark environment.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.000]   This is a great opportunity to reference another study, which was published in the Proceedings
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.740]   of the National Academy of Sciences, which shows that even having a small amount of light
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.100]   in the room, which isn't even that bright, while you're sleeping with eyes closed, can
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.880]   disrupt morning glucose levels.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:03.280]   So in other words, keep your sleeping environment dark, keep your nighttime environment dim
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.580]   to the best of your abilities, right?
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.260]   Certainly go out to dinner every once in a while, go to the movies, go out and have a
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.160]   party, enjoy yourself, if you have to go to the hospital, God forbid, or you have to tend
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.220]   to some emergency, do that.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.540]   But to the extent that you can control it within the confines of life and its demands,
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:26.200]   keep your nighttime environment dim or dark, because that independently of any sunlight
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.780]   and other bright light that you're viewing during the daytime and afternoon is going
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.520]   to positively improve your mood and mental health.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.180]   Now moving on to the other pillars, and these I'm going to move through a bit more quickly
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.320]   than I have the previous two, because we've done entire series on these, or I should say
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   serieses.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.380]   Is that how you pronounce it, someone put the plural of serieses in the comments on
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.460]   YouTube.
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.340]   The third pillar is movement, and when I say movement, I mean exercise.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:00.000]   As you all know, we should all strive to get anywhere from 180 to 220 minutes of zone two
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.220]   cardio per week, that's movement that allows you to hold a conversation, but were you to
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.800]   do it more intensely, or even a bit more intensely, you wouldn't be able to hold that conversation.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.220]   In addition, we should do some VO2 max work, we should get our heart rate very high at
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.560]   least once a week, doing some sort of movement that's safe for you, so that could be running
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.780]   or cycling or swimming or Pilates, whatever it is for you, getting your heart rate way,
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.980]   way up is also important, and to do that at least once a week.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.700]   But daily movement, either cardiovascular training or resistance training, and it's
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.860]   very, very clear that we need both, maybe not on the same days, in fact, I split them
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:39.620]   to separate days, resistance training done for anywhere from six to 10 sets per muscle
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.060]   group, either close to or to failure, this could be with weights, it could be with bands,
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.860]   it could be with machines, all of that was covered in detail in the podcast series that
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.140]   I did with Dr. Andy Galpin, an exercise physiologist, who's expert in all those areas.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:59.460]   I also did an episode on a foundational fitness protocol that has been distilled into a very
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:04.900]   simple three page PDF that you can get for completely zero cost by going to HubermanLab.com
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.660]   and just put foundational fitness protocol PDF, and you'll be taken to that toolkit.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.700]   So all of the details of a weekly exercise routine that involves daily movement, but
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.940]   also, certainly in my case, includes at least one full day of rest per week, because many
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.140]   people do indeed need one, maybe even two full days of rest per week.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.480]   So that highlights the third pillar, movement, but we know that cardiovascular training and
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.900]   resistance training aren't just great for our body, they also improve mood and mental
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.900]   health.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:38.200]   That's so very clear from the research literature, so we can't overlook those in a conversation
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.920]   about mood and mental health.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.960]   Now the fourth pillar is nutrition, and nutrition is a big topic, it's a very barbed wire topic.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.500]   If you get involved in this stuff online, you've got your people who believe that carnivore
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.740]   is better than vegan, you have the people who believe vegan is better than carnivore,
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.380]   most people are omnivores, you have your seed oil debates, and on and on and on.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.100]   We're not going to touch any of that now, indeed, if you want to learn more about nutrition
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:06.140]   and what works and what doesn't work for sake of aesthetic changes, weight loss, muscle
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:11.040]   gain, et cetera, I would refer you to the guest episode that we did with Dr. Lane Norton,
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.200]   you can find that again at Hubermanlab.com where we do a deep dive on all the variations
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.600]   and different nutritional protocols.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.840]   But suffice to say that regardless of whether or not you're vegan, omnivore, carnivore,
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.360]   or keto or whatever, everybody needs to consume sufficient amounts, but not excess amounts
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.420]   of quality calories per day.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.640]   Now you may do that by intermittent fasting, you may do that by a more traditional meal
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   scheduling, but everybody's going to need to do that because your body and brain, and
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.240]   indeed the parts of your body and brain that translate to mood and mental health, require
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.500]   macronutrients, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, as well as micronutrients.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:55.360]   So the key takeaway with nutrition is to make it quality nutrition within the bounds of
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.240]   whatever sort of nutritional program that you're following.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:04.700]   And that means getting most of your food sources from either non-processed or minimally processed
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.700]   foods.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.400]   So these will be foods that you're going to need to prepare or foods that would perish
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.780]   over time.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.400]   These are not the sorts of foods that live in boxes and cans and other packages that
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.960]   would allow them to live on the shelves forever and ever.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.680]   Okay, and as I say that, I know many people are shouting, well, what about rice?
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.560]   You know, rice can live on the shelf for a long time.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.500]   And yes, okay, I consider rice a minimally processed food because of course it can live
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.060]   on the shelf for a long period of time.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.520]   And here, I'm just going to back out of the whole conversation about nutrition at this
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.120]   point, because as you can probably tell, it's a deep series of rabbit holes that we can
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.720]   fall into and really get distracted.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.500]   The point is, make sure you're getting enough food.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.500]   Don't overeat.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:48.840]   We know energy toxicity is a problem for not just body composition, but for mental health.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.760]   So you want to get enough calories, but not too few calories.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.700]   And you'll want to make sure that you're getting them from quality sources.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.780]   And I say that because of course, food is not just the substrate for the cellular repair
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.120]   and indeed production of tissues in your body.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.560]   But it's also the substrate for all the sorts of neurotransmitters, right, which are derived
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.200]   from amino acid precursors that are derived from food, right?
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.400]   All of that dopamine stuff and serotonin stuff is derived from amino acids that come from
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   food sources.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.520]   So the link between nutrition and mental health should now be an obvious one.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.680]   As we all know, quality nutrition influences, of course, our physical health, but also our
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.780]   mental health and our cognitive functioning, our memory, our ability to learn new things
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.920]   and to focus.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.700]   And we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.100]   sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimally
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.880]   processed sources, as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.660]   all the cellular functions in our body, including the gut microbiome.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:53.980]   Now I, like most everybody, try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods, ideally, mostly
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.960]   from minimally processed or non-processed foods.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.460]   However, one of the challenges that I and so many other people face is getting enough
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.960]   servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics that
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.280]   often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:13.200]   That's why way back in 2012, long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.820]   And so I'm delighted that AG1 is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:22.020]   The reason I started taking AG1 and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day is that
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.680]   it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.440]   That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals,
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.260]   probiotics, and fiber to ensure optimal mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:41.480]   If you'd like to try AG1, you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.840]   They're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.280]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman to claim that special offer.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.940]   The fifth pillar in the big six is social connection.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.960]   And we're going to talk a little bit more about this later in the episode, but let's
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.400]   just be very brief and specific about this.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:06.560]   We all need to strive to limit the number of social interactions that we feel tax or
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.040]   even vex us that cause us stress.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.560]   This is something that was covered in depth in the episode with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.180]   where she talked about the fact that we don't just have a nervous system that regulates
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:21.860]   itself through experience and through our thoughts and our actions.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.860]   We are, as a species, interacting with other nervous systems, both of our own species,
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:31.520]   other humans, as well as non-human species, dogs and cats, and if you have them, horses
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.660]   and other animals.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.360]   So we need to think about our nervous system as being both regulated from the inside and
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.060]   through our own actions and choices and thoughts, but also through interaction with other nervous
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.060]   systems.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:47.080]   And while we don't always have as much control over which social interactions or work interactions
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:53.300]   we have to engage in, we should really strive to understand and indeed pay some serious
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.780]   attention to whether or not certain types of social interactions are what she referred
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:04.240]   to as net savings, neutral, or taxing, right?
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.860]   Certain types of social interactions with certain people or groups of people just make
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.860]   us feel taxed.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.580]   It makes us feel stressed.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:18.320]   It leads to negative affect, that is not good feelings or emotions, and often elevated levels
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.500]   of autonomic arousal that leave us ruminating and leave us having challenges with sleep.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.340]   We really should all strive to limit those interactions to the extent that we can.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:32.080]   On the reverse side of that, as Lisa Feldman Barrett so beautifully pointed out, we also
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:37.220]   have the capability to regulate each other's nervous systems in ways that produce savings,
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:42.980]   that is, that allow us to feel and indeed cause physiological changes that make us feel
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:49.380]   not just happier, not just relaxed, not just happy because we enjoy interacting with somebody
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:55.540]   or a group, but that give us a savings, that give us the kind of resources, literally metabolic
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.060]   and neurochemical resources that make us feel more capable and give us a sense of elevated
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.220]   mood and improved mental health when we are not engaging with those people.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.260]   And this is highly subjective, of course, but you should be able to distinguish.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.600]   In fact, I encourage you to spend a little bit of time, maybe even just five or 10 minutes,
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.060]   thinking about who are the individuals and groups that I interact with that leave me
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:22.280]   feeling taxed, that really seem to drain my energy and have me ruminating and in a not
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:26.460]   good space when I leave whatever interaction I had with them, this could be a real interaction
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.900]   or an online interaction.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.060]   Indeed, I did this the other day based on Lisa's suggestion, I found it to be tremendously
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.060]   useful.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:37.780]   And what I did is I decided to, and by the way, this was happening on a run where I was
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.580]   thinking, a lot of my mind is in a conversation with people that aren't even here.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.540]   I was sort of working through a conversation.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:50.300]   I was thinking about what I would say, what I did say, what they said in an interaction
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.500]   that unfortunately was pretty unpleasant.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.840]   It wasn't extremely unpleasant, but it was pretty unpleasant.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.060]   And I realized, okay, that is the sort of interaction that I would like to avoid in
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.940]   the future because it wasn't happening right then, but it was carried forward into a portion
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:10.180]   of my day, my morning run that for me is normally very pleasureful and quite sacred to me actually.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.220]   So paying some attention to how much of your internal dialogue is with yourself versus
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.220]   with others and how much of that is positive or negative is extremely beneficial.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.060]   And I'm not talking about always just thinking about oneself and not thinking about others.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:28.600]   To the contrary, we also need to think as Lisa pointed out about who are the people
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:34.360]   with whom we interact with or observe that lead us to have ongoing dialogue with them
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.020]   in our mind, or think about those interactions in ways that give us energy, that lead to
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.700]   energetic savings, literally metabolic savings that we can apply, not just in those interactions,
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.980]   but in our work endeavors and our solo endeavors, whatever that we're doing when we are away
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.980]   from those people.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:58.460]   So while this concept of savings or neutral or taxation of our metabolic and our neurochemical
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.480]   systems might seem a little bit squishy, it is not squishy.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.920]   This is a neurobiological concept.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.520]   It's also a psychological concept.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.580]   And it's one that I'm so glad that Lisa brought up because social connection, social interaction
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.460]   is so vital to our mood and mental health.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.840]   But oftentimes we hear social connection and we think, oh, that means we have to spend
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.840]   a lot of time with friends.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.560]   We have to organize dinner parties.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.800]   Well, sure, that's all fine and good if you can do that.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.840]   And I do, of course, encourage people to spend time with those that they love, but it's also
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.300]   important to take a step back and just think a bit, maybe even write out a bit, you know,
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.820]   who are the groups and sorts of individuals and interactions that really tax you?
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.500]   Who are the people that you find kind of neutral and what are the individuals and groups that
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.440]   really provide what Lisa referred to as savings?
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:46.080]   That is they tap into the metabolic and neurochemical pathways that lead us to have improved mood
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.900]   and mental health, not just during those interactions, but away from those interactions as well.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.540]   And often pervasively and extremely positively so.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.120]   So this is no small deal.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.280]   This is a really important aspect of our mental health.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.720]   Now the sixth pillar in the big six is stress control.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.020]   And the reason it's included is that, look, stress is going to happen.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.100]   Life is filled with so-called stressors.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.020]   And for a good number of years, in fact, the last 15 years, there's been a lot of debate
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.480]   in the field of psychology and neuroscience as well.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.680]   Whether or not stress is good for us, whether or not stress is bad for us, whether or not
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.420]   we simply need to reframe stress as good or bad.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.460]   And to some extent, all of that is true.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.660]   We know that chronic stress is not good for our memory, our immune system, or our health.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:37.000]   We also know that if you understand the reality, which is that stress also allows us to harness
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.580]   our mental and physical resources to perform better than we would otherwise in certain
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.780]   circumstances.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.980]   And that provided we can get to sleep each night, that perhaps stress isn't so bad and
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.820]   perhaps is even performance enhancing.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:54.660]   I talked about this in the guest episode with Dr. Ali Krum from the psychology department
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.660]   at Stanford.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.220]   And I've talked about this in other podcasts as well.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.020]   And I'm not here to tell you that stress is good for you.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.800]   I'm not here to tell you that stress is bad for you.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.980]   What I am going to tell you is that it is extremely important that we all have readily
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.400]   accessible stress management tools that work the first time and every time.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.860]   And these fall into two categories.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.140]   The first category are real-time tools.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.820]   Those tools that you can use to reduce your level of stress in real time.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:24.940]   And the best way that I'm aware of that's grounded in excellent physiology and neuroscience
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.660]   to reduce your stress in real time is the so-called physiological side.
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.820]   I did not invent this pattern of breathing.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.720]   It's not breath work per se.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.320]   This is a pattern of breathing that we all naturally do in our sleep to restore carbon
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.300]   dioxide and oxygen levels to their proper ratios.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.940]   We also do it periodically throughout the day without noticing.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:47.260]   Indeed, we have a defined or specific neural circuit in our brain that extends to our diaphragm
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:53.620]   and communicates with aspects of our heart, et cetera, that allow physiological size to
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:58.860]   calm us down faster, at least to my knowledge, than any other directed protocol.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.780]   And the physiological side, as many of you know, is very simple and straightforward.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.120]   Anyone can do this.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:09.740]   You simply do a big inhale through your nose, try and maximize the inflation of your lungs.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:14.660]   And then before you exhale, sneak in another brief inhalation, even if it's just a tiny
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.200]   micro inhalation to maximally inflate the lungs.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.580]   And that has an important effect on the little sacs in the lungs called the avioli of the
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.580]   lungs.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:26.040]   It's going to open up whatever avioli were collapsed in there.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.740]   And then you're going to do a long extended exhale through the mouth.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:35.820]   And typically just one, although sometimes it requires two or three, but just one physiological
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:41.800]   side is effective in bringing down one's level of stress significantly enough that you don't
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.980]   need to do it again.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.020]   So this can be done essentially anywhere and by anyone, I suppose probably couldn't do
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:51.240]   it if you were underwater or certainly don't do it if you're underwater, but otherwise
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.740]   it's a very safe and very effective way to calm down and reduce your levels of stress
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.760]   in real time, maybe before public speaking or in whatever circumstance you feel you need
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.700]   to calm down in real time.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.940]   So I'll demonstrate the physiological side for you here.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:07.880]   I've done this many times before in previous episodes, but for those of you that haven't
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.000]   heard or seen those episodes, I feel obligated to do it again now.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.420]   Okay, so it's a deep inhale through the nose, followed by another brief inhale through the
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.180]   nose, and then a long exhale through the mouth.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.780]   And before you start asking questions about what do I do if I have a deviated septum,
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.180]   can it be just through the mouth?
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.800]   Do the first two through the nose, do the third through the mouth.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:37.240]   So it's like this.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.960]   And indeed, I feel calmer.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.520]   And indeed, if you do it, you will feel calmer.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.320]   You'll notice that second inhale through the nose was kind of sharp in the sense that I
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.200]   had to really push, put some physical effort into making it happen.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   And you know, my shoulders jolted upwards.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.500]   If you're just listening to this and not watching my shoulders jolted upwards, that second inhale
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.520]   through the nose is important for a variety of reasons I've talked about elsewhere.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.440]   So the physiological side is going to be the go-to protocol for you, again, not invented
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.440]   by me.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.440]   This is not Huberman breathing.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.700]   This is a pattern of breathing discovered in the 1930s by physiologists.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.560]   It's hardwired into our nervous system, and that's what makes it so great.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.460]   It works the first time and it works every time.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:21.640]   So that's, to my knowledge, the best way to control your stress in real time.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.520]   Now why is that important for mood and mental health?
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.260]   Well, as we'll talk about later, if you want to access your so-called generative drive,
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.200]   a theme that we're going to get into in a bit more detail, this is something that came
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:37.580]   up during the series with Dr. Paul Conte, you will learn that stress and anger and negative
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:43.520]   emotions, while they can be very motivating, very arousing, they are not going to be good
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.560]   for your long-term mood and mental health, period.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:52.540]   So having tools to regulate your stress and your levels of anger, your levels of reactivity,
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:56.660]   and also to elevate your feelings of agency and control over your life, starting with
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:01.940]   agency and control over your physiology, your internal state, is going to be vital.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.420]   And what I love about the physiological side is that, of course, it's completely zero cost,
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:11.620]   but also there's a dedicated circuit in your brain and body for this particular pattern
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:12.620]   of breathing.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:17.120]   We do it spontaneously, but you can do it intentionally, and it works just as well,
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:21.700]   if not better, to regulate your levels of stress, that is to bring them down, which
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.900]   has outsized positive effects on your mood and mental health, not just in the moment,
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:31.540]   but it also should improve your confidence that when stress comes, because the world
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:35.860]   is filled with stressors, it's not if, it's when, when stress comes that you will have
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:41.120]   a physiologically, scientifically supported tool to deal with and reduce that stress.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.340]   Now in addition, I do believe it's important for sake of mood and mental health to also
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:50.580]   have a tool or a protocol to raise your stress threshold.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:55.700]   That is to increase your capacity to deal with life stressors without them feeling so
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:56.700]   stressful.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.440]   And there are a number of different ways to do this, but they all center around elevating
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.780]   your levels of adrenaline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, noradrenaline, those are the
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.040]   same thing, just they have multiple names, forgive me.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.820]   I didn't give the same two things, four names, so don't blame me, blame the other scientists
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.380]   that did it.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:19.340]   The point is, there are several ways that you can self-induce elevations of noradrenaline
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:25.740]   and adrenaline, and then to learn to anchor your mind and your thinking to stay calm in
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:30.620]   those elevated adrenaline states as a practice for when stressors hit you in the outside
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.020]   world and your adrenaline and noradrenaline spike.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:39.340]   Now one of the best ways to do this, because it works the first time and every time and
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:45.620]   is also zero cost, in fact, it will save you money, is to put yourself in a cold shower
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:51.440]   or other deliberate cold exposure environment, but most everyone has access to a cold shower.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.300]   Not everyone, but most people.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.740]   And of course, by turning off the heat, you're going to reduce heating costs, right?
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.840]   Your water bill.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:03.100]   So getting into a cold shower for a minute or so to elevate your levels of adrenaline
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:08.140]   and learning to either use your breathing, you could do physiological size, or to distract
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:14.180]   yourself, or whatever tools and approaches you need to be able to stay calm while you
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.340]   have elevated levels of adrenaline in your body.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:23.020]   And the reason deliberate cold exposure works so well to do this is that it is pretty non-negotiable.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.640]   Even if you really love cold showers or cold plunges or things of that sort, you're still
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.420]   going to get that elevated adrenaline and noradrenaline.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.780]   It's pretty much non-negotiable.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.240]   You know, for the first 10 or 15 seconds that you get into a cold plunge or a cold shower,
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.580]   you should fully expect yourself to feel stressed and for your breathing to accelerate.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:46.000]   And then your goal is to try and anchor or control your breathing in that stressful environment.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.500]   The reason for doing this is that it's a practice.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.860]   It's a practice that's going to translate to a better ability to manage your internal
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:57.820]   state and therefore your thinking, your cognition, and your ability to make good decisions under
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.820]   stress.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.320]   It's not about becoming untouched by stress.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.980]   It's about being able to better navigate stress.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:09.820]   Indeed, I think of this as analogous to driving in fog, something that I had to learn to do
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.540]   because I grew up in the Bay Area and it can be very foggy there sometimes.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.820]   And of course you don't learn to drive in fog the first day you learn how to drive,
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.980]   but the first time you hit heavy fog driving where you can only see one reflector in front
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.800]   of you at a time, it is truly stressful, right?
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.720]   You don't know if you're going to come up on another vehicle in an instant, which of
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   course can happen.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.400]   So you have to adjust a number of things.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.740]   You have to learn how to do that.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:36.640]   And while I would never elect to drive in fog, learning to drive in fog teaches you
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.180]   how to be comfortable driving in different weather environments.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:43.080]   Same thing with driving in a rainstorm or for you East coasters from the Northeast, learning
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.440]   how to drive in a snowstorm.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.660]   You would never elect to do that, but once you do it a few times, you feel more comfortable
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.960]   in those extreme conditions.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.820]   So that's really what raising your stress threshold is all about.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.340]   Of course, do it safely, do it under conditions in which you're not going to get hurt or anyone
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.820]   else will get hurt, but learning how to do this can be extremely beneficial.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:05.860]   And of course, deliberate cold exposure isn't the only way, but frankly, it's the most reliable
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.580]   way and it's the most versatile way to do that because you can do it in your shower
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.980]   or in a cold plunge at home so you can practice these things.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:17.700]   Again, safety first, always make sure you're not exposing yourself to cold to the extent
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.820]   that you're going to damage yourself mentally or physically, but it's a great practice.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.600]   And you could probably think of other ways to spike your adrenaline that was safe.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.260]   And of course, life will spike your adrenaline.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:33.460]   So you can also use real life as your, you know, your stress inoculation tool.
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.140]   And we all have to do that anyway.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.840]   What I'm suggesting is that you adopt a real time tool, physiological size, and that you
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.420]   adopt at least one offline tool that you do anywhere from one to three, maybe seven days
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.300]   a week, but at least one day a week that you put yourself into a cold shower, deliberate
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.460]   cold exposure, not for sake of increasing metabolism or anything else, but really just
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:59.460]   to learn how to calm yourself and maintain clear cognition when stress hits because indeed,
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.780]   stress is going to hit.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:04.420]   So that's the big six for improving mood and mental health.
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.820]   And the big six apply.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:10.320]   That is, they are the cornerstone for mood and mental health, regardless of who you are,
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.780]   regardless of your age, regardless of whether or not you're dealing with an acute or a severe
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:19.600]   mood or mental health disorder, or you find yourself to be reasonably healthy with respect
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.900]   to mood and mental health, and you simply want your mood and mental health to be stable
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.220]   and or improve over time.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:31.580]   Now, the reason why the big six, those six pillars are so important for mood and mental
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:37.020]   health, and indeed form a critical component of what Dr. Paul Conte referred to as the
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:43.740]   first principles of self-care, is that those six pillars establish a milieu, that is an
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:50.100]   environment of neurochemicals, including neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:55.700]   norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and other neurochemicals as well, as well as hormones, testosterone,
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:03.140]   estrogen, prolactin, cortisol, and immune molecules, and on and on that lead to a high
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:07.060]   degree of predictability in your brain and nervous system.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.420]   Now, what do I mean by that?
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:12.680]   Why would predictability be such a key component of mood and mental health?
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.980]   Is it really just about knowing that you're going to feel energized in the early part
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.860]   of the day and tired at the end of the day?
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.360]   Now, that might be part of it, but that's not the major takeaway.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:27.240]   The major takeaway is that as Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett so aptly pointed out, your brain and
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.920]   indeed your entire nervous system has a couple of major jobs, you know, it has the job of
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.040]   regulating your breathing and your heart rate, et cetera.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   It also has the job of regulating your thinking and your planning and your memory.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.840]   Those are the jobs of the brain and nervous system that we normally hear about.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:47.640]   But if we think about the more macro jobs that the brain has, the key function of the
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:52.520]   brain, certainly the parts of the brain that are more recently evolved, the ones involved
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:58.400]   in thinking and planning, et cetera, are really involved in generating predictions, predictions
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:02.520]   about what's going to happen next and whether or not you're going to be prepared for what's
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520]   going to happen next.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:08.720]   And indeed, Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett also beautifully illustrated this model of the
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:15.700]   brain as regulating a brain body budget and moods and a related topic, which she called
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.700]   affect.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:22.020]   Okay, I'll explain what affect is in a moment, setting the stage for being able to better
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:28.820]   predict what's going to happen next and therefore regulating your mood in the moment.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:32.720]   Let's just take a moment and explore that statement in a little bit more detail.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.920]   Essentially what she was saying and what I'm now again saying is that your brain and body
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.760]   go through different states.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.340]   Your state at a given moment can be labeled as your affect.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:46.840]   Your affect includes a lot of different things, including levels of autonomic arousal, levels
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:51.440]   of hormones, levels of transmitters, all of that stuff, but it falls under the umbrella
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.200]   of affect.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:59.680]   Affect essentially sets the stage for particular emotions to be more likely or less likely
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   to emerge.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.260]   So emotion and affect aren't the same thing.
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:08.600]   Affect is a bit more general and sort of undergirds the possibility of having certain moods like
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.640]   feeling elated, happy or sad or depressed.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:18.820]   It really sets the general stage for different types of specific emotions, even highly specific
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.820]   emotions.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:24.400]   So in that way, when you're taking care of the big six, when you're tending to these
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:29.240]   six pillars on a regular basis, and I should point out that we really want to tend to those
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:35.220]   six pillars every single day or every single 24 hours, we really need to make those a regular
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.100]   investment to the extent that we can.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:44.600]   When we do that, we create a neurochemical and a neural milieu that allows the brain
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.260]   to be in a better predictive state.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:54.480]   It allows the brain to give rise to certain affects spelled AFF ECTS.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:00.400]   So affects that lead to certain emotions being more or less likely to occur.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:05.480]   Put very simply, when we're tending to those six pillars on a regular basis, we feel better
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:11.020]   more generally, and therefore the emotions that we tend to have under different conditions,
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:15.720]   even conditions of a difficult interaction with a coworker or with a family member, tend
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.000]   to be more positive than if we are not tending to those six pillars.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.620]   Now in some sense, that's sort of a duh statement.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.400]   For instance, if you're sleep deprived, if you're not fed well, like you haven't eaten
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.200]   in a few hours, of course, you're going to be more irritable, you're going to be more
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:33.580]   reactive, you are going to be more emotionally labile.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:37.300]   But sleep and nutrition are just two of those six core pillars.
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:41.780]   When we talk about those core pillars and the necessity for tending to them on a regular
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:46.780]   every 24 hour basis, what we're really talking about is creating a milieu within our brain
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.780]   and nervous system that allows the nervous system to do what it does best.
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:55.820]   And in fact, what its main job is to do, which is to predict what's going to happen next.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:01.320]   Because as Lisa Feldman Barrett pointed out, emotions are really context dependent states
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   that allow us to navigate not just our present circumstances, but they are our nervous system
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:12.400]   and brain's best guess about the circumstances that we are soon going to encounter.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:16.840]   Now I don't offer you all of that as kind of a bunch of, you know, a tangled mess of
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.260]   nerd speak to confuse you.
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:23.880]   What I'm saying is that by tending to those six core pillars, you are shifting the likely
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:28.020]   affects that you will experience and therefore the likely emotions that you experience.
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:33.560]   So you're biasing your whole system towards more positive affect and more positive emotions,
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.140]   regardless of what your life circumstances happen to be and the stressors that you encounter.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:42.860]   And indeed, you also are including that six pillar of stress control.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:47.220]   So when those stressors arrive, you will be better able to navigate them.
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:52.920]   Now this view of emotion regulation of mood and mental health is certainly not a novel
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.920]   concept.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.700]   People have talked about the physiological regulation of mood from the time of William
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:00.480]   James and even earlier, you know, it's been a long standing question, for instance, or
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:05.120]   debate in psychology and philosophy, you know, do we feel anxiety in our body and then label
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.760]   it as anxiety or do we feel anxiety in our mind and then our body follows?
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.780]   That's been a long standing debate and frankly, there's evidence on both sides, which leads
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:18.040]   me to the conclusion, I think most neurobiologists and psychologists at the conclusion that those
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:22.960]   things are interrelated in a way that we can't really dissociate them completely at any level,
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.960]   right?
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.000]   If your brain goes up and you start breathing faster, you know, if I were to induce that
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.700]   state in you, you'd probably interpret that as feeling anxious.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.160]   In addition to that, something can make you anxious before your heart rate and breathing
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.220]   increases and then your heart rate and breathing increases.
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.480]   So no need to tease those apart.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:43.120]   But if you think about the brain in large part as a prediction machine and your brain
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.500]   as a metabolic regulator, it's trying to decide which organs need resources, how much resource
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:54.020]   can I dedicate to thinking, to creativity, to enjoying social interaction, to paying
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:57.500]   attention to what somebody else is saying as opposed to what's going on inside my body.
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:01.880]   All of those major functions of the brain as they relate to affect and emotions are
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.080]   going to be best supported.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:11.760]   That is biased toward positive mood, positive affect, positive emotions, and therefore positive
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.340]   mental health outcomes when we're tending to those six pillars.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:19.660]   Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett referred to that whole process as the brain regulating a brain
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.280]   body budget.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.080]   And she had beautiful analogies for that budget.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:27.840]   And that's what led to the description of social interactions as either generating savings
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:32.920]   or being neutral or generating a taxed feeling, literally taxing that brain body budget.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.860]   And I love that concept and it's one that you can keep in mind.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:40.780]   And indeed, we can inject a lot of specificity into this whole process of improving mood
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.460]   and mental health through specific protocols.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:49.380]   If you simply remember, if you make a daily investment in the six core pillars, you are
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.920]   building up that brain body budget.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:57.740]   You will have more energetic resources to spend on whatever life circumstances come
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:58.740]   your way.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.880]   Now, before we move into a discussion about protocols for how to better understand your
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:08.780]   life narrative to enhance your sense of self and confidence and things of that theme, I
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:14.800]   briefly want to mention that of course there are known tools out there in the medical community
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.860]   and psychological community for improving mood and mental health.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:25.880]   And while there are a variety of tools, one of the main tools of the psychiatrist is prescription
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:30.620]   drugs that target specific neuromodulator systems in the brain and body.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:37.940]   For instance, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or atypical antidepressants that
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:43.540]   target the dopamine and epinephrine systems such as well butrin, piperone, or other types
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.740]   of antidepressants.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:51.140]   Or for instance, nowadays there's a lot of growing excitement about clinical trials using
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:58.980]   relatively high dosages of psilocybin, which by the way, closely mimics the chemical serotonin.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:03.100]   That's right, psilocybin, which is converted to psilocin in the brain.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:07.220]   If you look at it chemically, it looks very much like serotonin, although it has distinct
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:08.380]   effects from serotonin.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.500]   I talked about psilocybin and what's being done in terms of the clinical trials, safety
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:16.780]   considerations, I talked about the potential hazard considerations and where the legality
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:20.300]   and all of that is going in that episode if you want to check that out.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:25.260]   But the reason I'm taking a moment to mention these drugs, things like SSRIs, Prozac, Zoloft,
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:32.660]   Citalopram, Wellbutrin, psilocybin, and so on, is that all of them target specific neuromodulator
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:39.260]   systems in the brain and body, and at the same time, it's fairly clear that mood disorders
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:45.180]   such as major depression are not necessarily deficits in things like serotonin or dopamine.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:48.460]   They can be, but most often they are not.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:53.420]   So why are such drugs prescribed for mood disorders and for mental health disorders?
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:58.580]   Well, because if specific neuromodulators like serotonin, dopamine, or epinephrine are
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:05.480]   dramatically increased above baseline, that affords the brain the ability to rewire itself.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:11.780]   Really the way to think about SSRIs or atypical antidepressants or psilocybin for the treatment
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:21.340]   of major depression is really to think about them as chemical tools to open or access neuroplasticity.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.620]   And that's why it's oh so important that those drugs be combined with talk therapy where
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:30.460]   people are actively working through the sources, the real life sources and the historical sources,
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.580]   maybe even the trauma-based sources of their depression.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:38.180]   And I mention this because there's a lot of debate nowadays as to whether or not these
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.340]   drugs are useful, whether or not the side effect profiles justify their use, whether
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.940]   or not they are applicable to young populations.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.380]   There's a lot of debate about this, and certainly in the case of the psychedelics, there's a
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:56.440]   lot, a lot of debate because this is a newly emerging area and there's still not a lot
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.160]   of data, although it's starting to increase over time.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:06.020]   But the key point here is that all of these drugs have the potential to work in some people,
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.020]   not others.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.380]   Some people, they simply don't work for and they cause more problems than solutions they
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:19.180]   solve, but they tend to work by increasing the propensity for neuroplasticity by changing
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.680]   the neuromodulator milieu in the brain.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.820]   And this is an important point when thinking about tools for enhancing mood and mental
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:31.900]   health, that when we think about tools for enhancing mood and mental health, and next
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:36.580]   of course, we're going to talk about the tools that are specifically designed to target a
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:41.180]   specific aspect of one's life story or concept of self.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:46.660]   All of that is always operating on a backdrop of two things, that overall neurochemical
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:51.480]   milieu and autonomic function that the six pillars relate to and support if we're tending
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480]   to those.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.980]   But any improvement in mood and mental health that's going to be significant, it's going
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:00.580]   to be noticeable, and it's going to be stable, it's going to be pervasive over time, is going
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:06.140]   to require that some degree of neuroplasticity, some degree of neural rewiring occur.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.760]   So I'm not bringing up the topic of these particular drug tools to say that they are
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.740]   the best way to improve mood and mental health.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:12.920]   I'm certainly not saying that.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.140]   They are but one way to potentially improve mood and mental health.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:22.280]   And if they are going to work, they always work best when done in concert with talk therapy
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.040]   because they are opening the opportunity for neuroplasticity, but then that neuroplasticity
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.200]   has to be directed toward a particular end point.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:35.040]   There has to be specific work that's being done by the individual or ideally the individual
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:42.320]   with an expert trained clinically certified therapist or psychologist or psychiatrist
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.400]   in order to make sure that the neuroplastic changes that occur lead to longstanding improvements
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.220]   in mood and mental health over time.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:55.480]   Indeed, the drugs that I just described were originally designed as tools to allow people
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:00.280]   to access changes within their brain that would then allow them to enhance mood and
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:05.280]   mental health, but not have to rely on the drugs themselves for improved mood and mental
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.280]   health.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:10.560]   And along those lines, I'm sure some of you out there are thinking about the supplement
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.240]   based or nutrition based approaches to enhancing these neuromodulators.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.600]   And indeed, while they don't have the same potency as things like Wellbutrin and SSRIs
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.680]   at increasing things like dopamine and serotonin respectively, there is a growing number of
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.880]   people out there that are relying on daily supplementation with anywhere from one to
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.680]   three grams of L-tyrosine, you know, amino acid precursor to dopamine combined with often,
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:39.800]   you know, 300 to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC as a way to enhance dopamine and acetylcholine
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.560]   and to set the stage for elevated levels of neuroplasticity.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:49.060]   But it's very important to point out that the amino acid precursors to the various neuromodulators
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:55.020]   like L-tyrosine, like L-tryptophan, so L-tyrosine precursor to dopamine, L-tryptophan precursor
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:01.440]   to serotonin, and so on, that those don't have the same degree of potency that is ability
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.240]   to enhance those neuromodulators.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:08.240]   And so the extent to which they enrich the possibility for neuroplasticity still remains
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.240]   somewhat obscure.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.380]   There haven't been clinical trials on that yet, at least not clinical trials that I am
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.420]   aware of.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.740]   So I mentioned all of that stuff about drugs, whether or not it's psychedelics, or whether
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:21.880]   or not it's prescription antidepressants, or whether or not people are using a supplement
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:28.340]   based amino acid based protocol for increasing certain neuromodulators, I feel is important
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.320]   to mention all of that because well, first of all, it's quite prominent out there, certainly
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.720]   in the case of prescription antidepressants, and there's growing prominence and use of
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:43.600]   relatively high dose psilocybin, again, always in done with support talk therapy, this is
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:50.560]   done in a legal setting, I said legal, not illegal, a legal setting with a board certified
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.680]   therapist, this is being done on university campuses within research labs.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.560]   And of course, I acknowledge that there are people who are using these compounds outside
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.340]   the realm of the university clinical study environment.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.140]   So I mentioned these chemicals, not because I'm pointing to them as the path to improved
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.540]   mood and mental health, they can be but they aren't always and as I mentioned before, they
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:15.220]   can sometimes cause problems that lead people to wish that they hadn't taken them or to
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.820]   decide to not take them any further decision that absolutely has to be made with a healthcare
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.220]   professional who's well certified to do that.
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:27.600]   But I'm mentioning these tools, because I want you to understand if they work, why they
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   work.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.260]   And one key point that was really emphasized by Dr. Paul Conte, who, as I mentioned before,
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:37.260]   as a psychiatrist, so he uses pharmacology in his practice, although he uses other non
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:42.320]   pharmacologic tools as well, is that these pharmacologic tools are never to be viewed
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.560]   as the be all end all of enhancing mood and mental health, they are but one path to improving
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.180]   mood and mental health, and indeed should be viewed as a path to getting people who
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:57.120]   are otherwise unable to engage in those six core pillars, those first principles of mental
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.080]   health to be able to do those things on a regular basis.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:05.680]   And then perhaps, based on a discussion with their clinician, these people could come off
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.080]   those pharmacologic agents, maybe yes, maybe no, it depends on the individual, it depends
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.360]   on the circumstances.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.500]   But those core six pillars, those first principles of mental health that include but are not
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.760]   limited to those core six pillars are absolutely essential.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.480]   There's no drug that can replace those core six pillars.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.260]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker.
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.960]   Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.460]   and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:41.120]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:45.480]   many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.880]   from a quality blood test.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.220]   A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.600]   back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.680]   But you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.800]   With inside tracker, they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.220]   that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones,
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.220]   et cetera.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:10.300]   But it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition, behavioral
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.900]   modification, supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.940]   ranges that are optimal for you.
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:21.380]   If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20%
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.140]   off any of inside tracker's plans.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.640]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.800]   Okay, so setting aside the core six pillars, let's now talk about other tools for mood
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.860]   and mental health that center around really what we more typically think of when we think
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:39.080]   of mood and mental health, which is emotions.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:44.500]   When Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett was a guest on the podcast, she said something that was
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.940]   really incredible.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:50.660]   And it's something that's strongly grounded in excellent scientific data, which is the
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:56.500]   more specificity that we can put to labeling our emotions, the better off we're going to
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.060]   be in terms of our overall mental health.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.140]   Let me restate that.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:07.340]   The more specific language that we can put to our own internal emotions, even if that
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:11.860]   language is just to ourselves in our own internal narrative, we don't even have to speak out
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:17.540]   what those labels are, the better that we're going to feel over time.
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:22.220]   And indeed this effect can be quite rapid, and indeed Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett has done
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.580]   research on this very specific topic.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:28.100]   It's something that's referred to as emotional granularity.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:34.980]   So while some of us move through life with a sort of what I call emojification of emotions,
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:39.820]   you know, you get your happy face, happy, your sad face, sad, you know, you're angry,
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.620]   depressed, anxious.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.420]   Those are labels for emotional states, or you could think of them as affects or emotions.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.140]   I think of them as emotions, but they're not very specific.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.620]   They're pretty broad bins.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:56.340]   We say sad or depressed or super depressed or super sad, anxious, panic.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.860]   And we think of that as nuance, but it's not very nuanced.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:04.340]   And Lisa's laboratory and other laboratories have explored two things.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.820]   First, if people are asked to or encouraged to put more granularity, more specificity
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:13.940]   on what they're feeling, then it seems that their levels of emotional processing are better
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.940]   overall.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:15.940]   How does that translate to emotions?
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:23.940]   Well, it translates to better overall feelings of well-being when one is placing more specificity
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:27.340]   on positive emotions.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.940]   And the flip side is also true.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.660]   So this is important to know.
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:36.700]   If one places more specificity on negative emotions, it also can enhance one's kind of
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.540]   experience of those negative emotions.
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.800]   Now that means that this is a two-sided blade, all right?
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.500]   This isn't always a good thing.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.440]   And if one is thinking about protocols for improving mood and mental health, the data
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:54.980]   make very clear that adding more specificity to our positive emotions in terms of the language
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.180]   we use, but also just the depth with which we process and think about those positive
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:02.140]   experiences can be very beneficial for us.
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:05.140]   So there are two studies that I'd like to highlight that relate to this.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:10.320]   The first is entitled Effective Self-Monitoring Through Experience Sampling on Emotion Differentiation
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.500]   in Depression.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:17.420]   And the second study is entitled Emotional Granularity Increases with Intensive Ambulatory
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.540]   Assessment.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.500]   Methodological and individual factors influence how much.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.140]   Now each of these studies focus on something slightly different.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:30.620]   The first study was mainly focused on people who have depression and they were cued several,
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:36.340]   if not many times per day, to just think about and report on their emotional state.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:41.300]   And that was done in order to get people to place more granularity, more specificity on
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:45.120]   what they're feeling, but also simply to tap into how they're feeling on a more regular
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.540]   basis throughout the day.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:51.360]   The second study, which is one that included Dr. Lisa Feldman-Barre as an author, was slightly
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.240]   different because it focused on non-depressed individuals and it cued them to touch into
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.220]   their emotions more times per day.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:02.980]   And it also included some physiological measurements and one in particular that we're going to
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.660]   talk about in some detail.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.700]   Now I don't have time to go into all the details of these studies, I may do that in a future
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:12.420]   podcast episode, but the key takeaways are very important for all of us to know, which
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:19.820]   are, first of all, the more often that you can ask yourself, "What am I really feeling
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:20.820]   right now?
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.820]   How do I feel?"
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:29.560]   And, and this is so critical, the more that you force yourself to not use broad labels
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:37.460]   or simply valence labels, valence labels are good or okay or bad, and instead understand
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:43.940]   that good is not an emotion, okay is not an emotion, bad is not an emotion, but rather
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:49.380]   saying, "I feel curious, but a little anxious," if that happens to be the case, or "I feel
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:57.380]   bored, but also a little bit in positive anticipation about what's going to happen tomorrow."
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:03.300]   Things of that sort, putting more nuance and specificity on your emotions, but also touching
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:08.980]   into or thinking about your own emotional states more times per day, clearly has positive
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.300]   outcomes for mood and mental health.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:15.840]   And the reasons for that are incredibly interesting, and this is something everybody should understand.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.540]   Why would it be that putting more specificity on what we're feeling, so perhaps just in
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.780]   our own heads, like thinking, "Okay, how do I feel right now?"
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:29.300]   Like if I were to do that right now, I'd say, "I feel energized and happy."
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.220]   I do, I really enjoy doing what I'm doing.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:36.660]   So I wouldn't say I'm like off the charts in awe or elation, but I'm very happy and
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:37.660]   I feel energized.
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:43.900]   Earlier today, I was feeling a little bit fatigued and a little bit confused because
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:48.020]   I was trying to sort out something and it wasn't making sense to me.
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:54.240]   So assessments like that, which can be told to somebody else or that we just hold internally,
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.180]   done repeatedly throughout the day, anywhere from three to six times throughout the day,
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:01.660]   just periodically pinging ourselves, maybe you set an alarm or maybe you just decide
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:06.220]   to every once in a while, maybe every time you go into an elevator or every time you
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.780]   go up a flight of stairs, you just ask yourself, "Yeah, how do I feel right now?"
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.940]   And thinking about that for a moment, and you don't have to write it down, although
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:18.180]   I suppose you could, but it turns out that just that practice can really enhance our
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:23.760]   so-called emotional granularity that can enhance our positive emotions and affect.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.760]   And in addition, it provides us a better sensitivity to better understand those negative emotions,
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.740]   which sounds like it might be a bad thing, but those negative emotions have information
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.840]   in them, right?
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:41.200]   This is one thing that's often lost in those broad categorizations of anxious or sad or
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.200]   depressed.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.780]   And keep in mind, of course, that some people are genuinely clinically depressed and that
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:48.680]   needs to be taken extremely seriously, just like some people are genuinely clinically
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.440]   anxious and that needs to be taken seriously.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.780]   But most of us, when we throw out the words depressed, angry, sad, we're not using enough
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:01.020]   nuance and it doesn't really apply to our internal states or the circumstances that
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.980]   we're in, and as a consequence, we suffer.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.720]   It's not just about communicating our emotions, we suffer because the data say that the more
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:14.580]   nuanced, the more emotional granularity that we have, the richer is our experience of the
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:22.820]   positive aspects of life and the more effectively we can navigate the negative aspects of life,
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.820]   right?
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:28.340]   Again, negative emotions perhaps isn't the best way to even describe negative emotions
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:31.020]   because that label negative implies that we should avoid it.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:35.860]   And in fact, those negative emotions provide a lot of information about perhaps social
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:40.220]   interactions that we should seek to avoid in the future and so on and so forth.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:44.980]   Now, one of the most interesting things about this whole process of increasing emotional
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:49.300]   granularity and touching in several times per day into how we feel, something that's
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:53.620]   completely zero cost, takes just a moment to do, that we can get much better at over
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:57.000]   time, that was clearly seen in these studies that people get much better at doing this,
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.860]   it becomes more facile for them very quickly, is that it correlates with improvements in
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:08.700]   physiological metrics that relate to overall improvements in mood and mental health.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:14.540]   And the specific physiological metric that I'm referring to is so-called vagal tone.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:18.780]   Some of you have perhaps heard of the vagus nerve, it's the 10th cranial nerve, it's an
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:25.360]   extensive peripheral nerve that goes out of the brain, kind of at the level of the neck,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.780]   it's one of the cranial nerves that extends to essentially all the organs of the body,
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:32.260]   the heart, the lungs, et cetera, but it's a two-way street.
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.680]   It's a super highway of nerves out of the brain and into the body, and it's a super
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:42.720]   highway of nerves back from the bodily organs to the brain, and it's involved in regulating
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.560]   a lot of so-called autonomic function, so how fast our heart rate is, how fast our breathing
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.600]   is, rates of digestion, and all of that weaves together to create those things that we call
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.500]   affect, our internal states.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.460]   So without going into a ton of detail about the vagus nerve, there's something that's
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:02.520]   called cardiac vagal control.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:07.820]   Cardiac vagal control is the extent to which that vagus nerve can impact your heart rate
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:11.700]   and your overall feelings of calm or alertness.
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:17.940]   Now, the simple way to think about this is more commonly referred to as heart rate variability.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:22.020]   Heart rate variability is simply the distance between your heartbeats, or rather the time
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:26.960]   between your heartbeats, which we know if those timings between your heartbeats are
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:34.000]   somewhat variable, that is correlated with positive physical and mental health outcomes.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.920]   One of the ways that you can increase heart rate variability is to get regular cardiovascular
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:44.240]   exercise as well as doing resistance exercise, and no surprise, getting sufficient amounts
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.940]   of quality sleep each night is also going to be very beneficial for heart rate variability.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:54.100]   Now, exercise and sleep, of course, are wonderful, but it turns out that there's also a very
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:17:00.080]   rapid way to increase heart rate variability by activating the vagal innervation of the
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.040]   heart and the way that the heart and some other circuits within the so-called brainstem
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:10.720]   interact, and that's through something called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:17.060]   Respiratory sinus arrhythmia can be summarized very simply by saying when you inhale, you
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:23.240]   speed your heart rate up, and when you exhale, you slow your heart rate down.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.320]   And it's that exhale slowing your heart rate down that's mediated by the vagus nerve.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.140]   Now there's a more thorough description of that, which I'll just give you now, and it's
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:35.020]   not that lengthy, so here's how it goes.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:42.460]   When you inhale, your diaphragm actually moves down, and as a consequence, your heart actually
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.180]   gets a little bigger, has a little more space.
[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:49.940]   As a consequence, the fluid in your heart moves a little more slowly per unit volume,
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:55.120]   and there's a neural signal to speed the heart up, conversely, when you exhale, the diaphragm
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.320]   moves up, that means there's a little less space for the heart in the general area where
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.360]   it's sitting, so the heart gets a little bit smaller, a little more compact, that means
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:07.100]   that the fluid in your heart is moving more quickly through that smaller space, and there's
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:12.100]   a neural signal mediated by the vagus to slow the heart down, so that's why inhales speed
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:15.620]   your heart up, and exhales slow your heart down.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:20.900]   That is the basis of so-called RSA, or respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:26.580]   Now what does any of that have to do with the granularity of language that we place
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.660]   on our emotions?
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:34.240]   Well, it turns out there's several studies showing that when people place more descriptive
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:39.240]   granularity on their emotions, that is correlated with, okay, it's not causal, but it's correlated
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:44.880]   with improvements in respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which we know correlate with improvements
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:50.040]   in heart rate variability, indeed, it's one of the major bases for heart rate variability,
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:55.480]   which we know is correlated with not just positive physical health outcomes, but positive
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:00.360]   mental health outcomes, including lower levels of anxiety, improved sleep, and overall levels
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.360]   of mood.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.960]   This is a topic that I'm very familiar with, because last year, my laboratory at Stanford
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.800]   University School of Medicine, in collaboration with a colleague of mine, Dr. David Spiegel,
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:15.480]   our associate chair of psychiatry, also at Stanford University School of Medicine, published
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.980]   a clinical trial in Cell Reports Medicine, showing that there's a particular pattern
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:27.100]   of breathing that people can do for just five minutes per day, that is effective in significantly
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:35.980]   improving various metrics related to mood, and reducing anxiety, and also improving sleep,
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:41.140]   although I should say the protocol I'm about to describe, didn't uniformly improve all
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:45.180]   of those metrics, it had a bigger effect on some versus others, I'll provide a link to
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:49.500]   that study in the show note captions, but if you're wondering what this protocol is
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:54.000]   that people did for five minutes a day that allowed them to, by the way, pervasively improve
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.340]   their mood, so it wasn't just their mood while they were doing this five minute a day protocol,
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:03.440]   it was improvements in mood around the clock, essentially, as well as improvements in other
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:09.640]   physiological metrics and other aspects of those six core pillars, it was that physiological
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.680]   side that we talked about earlier, although in this case, we didn't have people do just
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.460]   one physiological side, we had people set aside five minutes per day, so set a timer
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:24.440]   for five minutes, they could sit or lie down, they could do it any time of day, and we just
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:29.700]   had them repeat that physiological side for a duration of five minutes total, so that
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:34.560]   they would do two inhales through the nose, and then a full exhale to lungs empty through
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.360]   the mouth, then they would do it again, and then they would do it again, and again until
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:43.700]   those five minutes were completed, again, the outcome of that clinical trial was that
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:47.980]   that particular pattern of breathing, which we called cyclic physiological sighing for
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:54.260]   five minutes per day, again, done any time of day, had the most positive outcomes in
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:58.340]   terms of improving mood and mental health and autonomic function, those things related
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:04.100]   to sleep and heart rate variability, so that's a very simple, very minimal time investment,
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:10.260]   zero cost tool that anyone can use that, again, improves various metrics of physical health,
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:16.240]   but also improves metrics of mental health, and it ties right back in with what was observed
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:25.620]   in the work by Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, exploring how putting more word label emotional granularity
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:30.280]   on one's emotional states positively impact our physiological state, and the fact that
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:34.980]   thinking about our emotions more frequently throughout the day and deliberately putting
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:41.720]   more label granularity on those emotions frequently throughout the day is correlated with this
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:46.860]   improvement in respiratory sinus arrhythmia and heart rate variability, the fact that
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:51.420]   these things all relate to one another should not surprise us, because indeed, there's a
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:56.020]   previous paper, this is a quite extensive review, actually, it's a very nice review.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:00.460]   It's one that I encourage anyone who's interested in these topics to explore, especially psychologists
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:04.900]   who might have a interest in physiology or psychiatrists are simply people who are interested
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:07.080]   in mind body stuff.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.940]   This is a review published in 2017 in the journal biological psychology entitled cardiac
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:17.180]   vagal control as a marker of emotion regulation in healthy adults a review and again, it's
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:22.700]   a really wonderful literature review of the peer reviewed primary research, which really
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:29.800]   establishes that this thing, vagal tone, our ability to kind of put the brakes on our autonomic
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:34.000]   nervous system and slow our heart rate down deliberately through our breathing, and perhaps
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.560]   even just by stopping and reflecting on what our emotional states are, is really beneficial
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.500]   for our overall mood and mental health.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:46.860]   And I want to highlight bold and underline that word overall, because it's not just the
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:50.340]   case that people experience elevated mood and mental health in the moments where they
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.180]   stop and go, Oh, how am I feeling?
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:56.000]   Oh, you know, am I feeling bored or agitated?
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.140]   Do I feel particularly excited?
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:03.440]   Sure, that can have some impact on physiological metrics and mood and mental health.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.620]   But in all of these studies, the outcome seems to be that people's overall levels of mood
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:12.480]   and mental health are enhanced, not just while they're thinking about their emotions or doing
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:17.120]   this five minute a day cyclic sign, but around the clock, which is really terrific, because
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:21.160]   I think that's what most all of us want, which is improved mood and mental health, not just
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:26.300]   in the moments when we do a practice or in the few minutes afterwards, but 24 hours a
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.300]   day.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.680]   I suppose we might segment out sleep during which you know, hopefully we're having great
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.240]   dreams as opposed to other kinds of dreams.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:39.320]   But the point is, everyone, I have to imagine would like to feel better and have elevated
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:43.280]   mood and mental health during the times when they're awake, and indeed, these sorts of
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:47.960]   protocols have been shown to do that, or so say the scientific data.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.120]   Now we are going to discuss the tools for enhancing mood and mental health gleaned from
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.880]   the four episode guest series with Dr. Paul Conte, who is a medical doctor specializing
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.480]   in psychiatry.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.080]   He also has particular expertise in trauma.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:05.700]   However, the four episode guest series that we did with Dr. Conte was really about exploring
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:11.160]   the self, as well as tools and protocols for not just gaining a better understanding of
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:18.220]   oneself, but also for gaining a better understanding and tools for relating to others, aka relationships.
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:22.480]   Thread through the series was a model of the mind and how it works to create everything
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:28.800]   from feelings, thoughts to behaviors that Dr. Paul Conte described as an iceberg model.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:33.900]   I perhaps should refer you to the fact that he actually drew out this model and we provided
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:39.000]   it as a zero cost PDF in the show note captions for every single one of those episodes in
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.800]   that four episode series.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:46.120]   We also provide a link to this model in the show note captions for this tools episode.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.720]   The model is called the iceberg model, and as the name suggests, it resembles an iceberg
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:57.040]   in which the vast majority of our mind's processing occurs below our conscious awareness in our
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.080]   unconscious mind.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.480]   So that's the portion of the iceberg that resides below the surface.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:06.220]   Whereas the portion of our mental processing that we are aware of resides above the water
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:08.340]   surface, the so-called conscious mind.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:13.360]   So a key aspect of the iceberg model is that the unconscious mind is responsible for the
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.400]   vast majority of our feelings, thoughts and behaviors, but that we are not aware of how
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.820]   this unconscious mind is doing that.
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:25.820]   And by extension, the tools and protocols that Dr. Conte described largely deal with
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:31.020]   going into the unconscious and figuring out how the unconscious processing is influencing
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:35.140]   our conscious processing both in healthy and in unhealthy ways.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:39.540]   And when we say in healthy and unhealthy ways, we're largely referring to the presence of
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:40.540]   defenses.
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:43.300]   So some of you have perhaps heard of defenses before.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:47.060]   Some defenses can indeed be healthy and others are unhealthy.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:51.940]   There are defenses such as projection, sublimation, denial.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:55.660]   And during the course of that four episode series, Dr. Conte explains how projections
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.260]   are not always bad for us.
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:04.140]   Indeed, they can protect us from panic, from severe trauma, but they also can create difficulties
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:08.920]   in processing our own understanding of self and of our life experiences in ways that can
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.780]   actually be damaging to us.
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:15.780]   So a key takeaway from that four episode series is to understand and acknowledge that your
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:20.100]   unconscious mind is driving much of what you feel, think and do.
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:25.540]   However, by doing structured exploration of the self, and we'll talk about how to do that,
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:30.100]   one can gain better understanding of how that unconscious processing is influencing what
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:33.060]   you think, feel, believe and do.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:37.100]   So once you accept the important role of the unconscious mind, and you make the decision
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:40.800]   that you want to better understand how your unconscious mind and conscious mind are in
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:45.220]   this constant dialogue, and how you can have that dialogue better serve you.
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:50.020]   There are a series of actionable tools that you can do that will allow you to better understand
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.860]   yourself and how you relate to others.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:57.140]   And the first of these tools is to really understand your self concept.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:02.180]   Now of course, most all of us know our own name, rarely do we ever forget that name.
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:06.860]   We have some concept of where we're from, who our parents are, what our present and
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:11.700]   future goals might be, where we've succeeded, where we failed in life, and on and on.
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:17.740]   But the self concept goes far beyond that sort of CV list, or our biography of self.
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:23.900]   Indeed, the self concept has a lot to do with our self confidence, our feelings of ability,
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:29.140]   both to overcome challenges, but also our ability to serve the world that we're in,
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.660]   and our ability to change ourselves over time.
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:36.220]   Now, of course, the degree to which somebody might have confidence or less confidence,
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:39.800]   or the degree to which somebody feels that they can exert influence on their environment
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.420]   and their goals is, of course going to vary based on their personal history.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:50.180]   But as Dr. Conti explained, even independent of all that, if one puts in some work to better
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:56.320]   understand their self concept, to really get a clear picture of oneself, from that one
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:02.360]   can develop more agency with which to pursue one's aspirations, and to reach their goals.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:07.900]   And the key concept here is one that's particularly powerful for both exploring and building up
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:09.780]   one's concept of self.
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:13.220]   And that's to consciously and deliberately build a life narrative.
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:18.700]   Now a simple way to do this that can be very effective is to create a series of folders
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:19.700]   or documents.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.220]   It could even be a stack of papers.
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:23.780]   I prefer to do this in electronic form.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:28.040]   And I confess that even before learning about this tool from Dr. Conti, I had initiated
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:31.580]   doing this tool starting back in 2015.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:35.940]   And it's fairly straightforward, but as I mentioned before, it can be very powerful.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:40.580]   And it simply consists of building out separate folders or pieces of paper, and this could
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:46.000]   be done electronically or on real world paper with paper and pen or paper and pencil.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.020]   And essentially what you do is you're going to divide your life history into some regular
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.020]   increments.
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:57.020]   So for me, the way that I did this is I created a folder on my laptop that I actually called
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.020]   lifetime.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.100]   So that's the title of the main folder.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.840]   And then within that folder, I have a series of folders, each of which spans a particular
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.840]   phase of my life.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:10.560]   So zero to five years of age, six to 10 years of age, 11 to 15 years of age, and so on and
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.560]   so forth.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:16.700]   Now I'm 48 years old, so I have folders that extend to age 50 currently, although I will
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:19.320]   add folders going forward very soon.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.160]   And the idea here is that for each of those folders, you're going to place a single word
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.440]   document into that folder.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.880]   And then on that word document, you're not going to journal.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.500]   You're not going to do any sort of extensive writing.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:36.420]   Rather, you're simply going to put down bullet points with titles.
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:40.380]   It could be one or two sentences, but typically it's just a few words describing some of the
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:45.140]   key milestone events that you remember from that particular phase of your life.
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:48.480]   So just for sake of example, I'll read off some of the things that are included in the
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:51.900]   folders for my particular lifetime narrative.
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.180]   But of course, this relates to my lifetime narrative.
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.940]   You should, of course, put the milestones and key bullet points that relate to your
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:58.980]   lifetime narrative.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:02.840]   But again, just to give you a sense of the sorts of things that made it into this folder
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:09.180]   in my six years old to 11 year old folder on that document, I put where I was living
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:12.120]   at that time, the city I was living at, the school that I went to.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:17.600]   I put a couple of teachers names, teachers that had a particular influence on me, a particular
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.040]   summer camp experience that was not a traumatic experience, by the way, it was a happy experience.
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.260]   But for me, it turned out to be a very transformative one.
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:29.980]   And then there are a couple other things in there that are just recollections of childhood
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:31.580]   friends names, okay?
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:36.320]   So seemingly mundane information perhaps, but it looks more or less like a biography
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.260]   and yet other folders.
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:44.860]   So for instance, the folder that spans from 25 to 30 years of age is the time that I was
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:45.860]   in graduate school.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.580]   So it includes a note about graduate school, a note about particular hobbies that I was
[01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:54.260]   interested in, in addition to my scientific research at the time, a couple of key relationships,
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:58.680]   a couple of key relationship challenges, as well as some things that at that time I was
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:03.380]   processing about prior years, in particular, my teen years in high school.
[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:07.140]   Now the key thing here is that whatever goes into these folders is what's important to
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.140]   you.
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:12.120]   It could be positive events, it could be negative events, it could be events that for whatever
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:16.940]   reason you remember and keep surfacing in your mind, that you think might be interesting
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:20.340]   or important at some later time or that you're concerned you might forget.
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:23.820]   In fact, that might be a really good metric for whether or not you include something in
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:24.820]   these folders or not.
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:28.900]   If there's something that you want to make sure that you never forget, but that you think
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:32.260]   you might forget, I would encourage you to put it onto that Word document and put it
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:34.060]   into that particular folder.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.280]   Again, this isn't about creating a coherent life story, this is about creating a series
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:46.260]   of segments of small collections of key life events, positive, negative, neutral, inspiring,
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:50.160]   basically anything that was salient for you at that particular time.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.160]   And of course, if you want to put reflections about those particular events into that Word
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.480]   document, you're more than welcome to do that.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:03.780]   But the basis of this self-concept developing exercise is just that, it's to develop a historical
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.440]   sense of yourself.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.900]   Of course, bringing you up to present day, where you will continue to add things to whatever
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:14.020]   Word document goes into that particular folder for the age you happen to be now.
[01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.900]   Now for some of you, this kind of autobiographical bullet pointing might seem like it's just
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:24.760]   that, some attempt to build or write an autobiography, but it's very important to remember that these
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.180]   folders are for you.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:29.960]   These folders are not about writing a book about your life history, although if you decide
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:35.320]   to do that with these folders at some point down the line, that sounds great, but that's
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.620]   not the goal here.
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:41.740]   The goal is for you to build a structured narrative representation of events that were
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:43.600]   key in your life.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:48.540]   And as described in the series with Dr. Conti, this goes way beyond just understanding your
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:49.540]   past.
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.340]   This is really about understanding past.
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:55.660]   It's about understanding yourself at present and indeed it threads into your goals and
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:57.660]   aspirations for the future.
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:03.540]   An important thing to understand about this tool or protocol is that it also has a incredible
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:08.560]   ability to anchor you in your perception of the passage of time.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.360]   Some of us track the passage of time better than others, both within the day and across
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.320]   days and years and so forth.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.880]   But this exercise in particular is very good at allowing you to see, you know, how much
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:23.040]   time you devoted at a given stage of your life to a given endeavor, whether or not you're
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:27.760]   stuck in patterns whereby you're still engaging in certain types of things professionally
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:35.080]   or relationship wise or in any other number of different ways that have you in a pattern
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.360]   that may or may not be serving you well.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:41.720]   I want to emphasize again that this exercise is not about goal setting.
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:47.320]   It's about your ability to build a structured narrative pattern from which you can look
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:51.660]   at it and then make a determination as to whether or not, you know, you feel that you're
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.940]   currently on the right path for you.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:57.680]   But it's not about projecting forward as to what your goals are.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.760]   We'll soon talk about that.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:01.180]   We'll talk about goals and aspirations in a moment.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:05.560]   This is really about better understanding what led you up to the place that you are
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.560]   now.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.040]   And it really helps you pinpoint the key work that you need to do in terms of exploring
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.640]   your unconscious and conscious mind using some tools that we're going to get into subsequently.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.960]   So there's really no strict rules about how to do this exactly, except that I do encourage
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:21.840]   you to make those increments across your lifespan manageable.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:24.720]   I wouldn't suggest doing it one for every year.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.600]   I wouldn't suggest a folder, one for every 10 years.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:32.080]   I think a three to five year increments seem like a more reasonable and tractable way to
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.140]   go about this.
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:38.340]   So that's one of the sorts of tools that Dr. Conti referred to as to how to build up one's
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:43.880]   self-concept, which directly relates to things such as our confidence, our ability to track
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:48.100]   our own behavior, understand some of our motivations, both conscious and unconscious.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:51.540]   But of course, that practice is mainly a conscious exercise.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:56.140]   It's really not tapping directly into the unconscious in any kind of direct way as far
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.180]   as we know.
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:00.600]   Now we can contrast that with the tools and protocols that are designed to tap into the
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.060]   unconscious mind.
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.480]   And of course, there are a number of different ways to do this that were discussed in that
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:07.720]   four episode series with Dr. Conti.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.800]   But one of the most powerful ways to do this is by thinking about and indeed sometimes
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:16.120]   writing about or even analyzing one's dreams.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.440]   Now dream analysis is something for which you can find a lot of books out there.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.660]   There are a lot of theories.
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:24.020]   There's also a lot of argument that perhaps dream analysis, which has roots in Freudian
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:29.000]   psychology as well as other traditions, is perhaps not accurate.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.480]   I don't think we want to consider whether or not dream analysis is accurate.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.200]   Rather, I think we should just acknowledge that when we are dreaming, in particular the
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:41.300]   dreams that we have toward the later part of our night, which are the dreams associated
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:46.160]   with rapid eye movement sleep, that tend to be very emotionally laden dreams as compared
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.500]   to the dreams that we have earlier in the night, well, when we consider the content
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:54.260]   of those dreams, even if we're not trying to interpret them, it's very clear that those
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:36:00.900]   dreams reflect the unconscious mind controlling more of our internal dialogue or what we are
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.740]   experiencing at that time.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:06.740]   Whereas when we are awake, our conscious mind tends to take over more of the narrative,
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:10.340]   the internal narrative, and the control of our feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:14.520]   But as I mentioned before, the unconscious mind is always exerting an influence regardless
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.860]   of whether or not we are asleep or awake.
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:21.500]   With that said, one way to explore the unconscious mind and to begin to get a better understanding
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:27.680]   about how it might be influencing our waking states and behaviors is to actually record
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.720]   and think about one's dreams.
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.120]   Now of course, some people remember their dreams on a regular basis.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.480]   Other people don't.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.700]   Some people actually believe that they don't dream.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:41.460]   Studies out of sleep laboratories at Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, and elsewhere
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:46.660]   all generally agree that everybody dreams, but not everybody remembers their dreams.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:51.960]   So if you're interested in tapping into an understanding of what your dreams are telling
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:58.400]   you, which is basically a way of saying what your unconscious mind or dialogue consists
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:04.460]   of, I highly recommend putting a journal, so this would be any kind of paper and pen
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:05.980]   or paper and pencil type journal.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:13.200]   And the idea is this, if you wake up and you can remember your dream, write down a few
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.920]   key bullet points from that dream.
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:18.980]   If you feel you can write out the dream in a very kind of linear narrative, this happened
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:21.020]   and that happened and this happened and that happened, great.
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:26.160]   But most people find that their memory of their dream is rather fragmentary.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.580]   Other people can't remember their dream, or at least they wake up, they feel like they
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:35.580]   were having a dream, but they can't remember all of it or key components of it.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:40.420]   And for that, I suggest that you try keeping your body completely still and closing your
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.860]   eyes once again.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:47.460]   We don't quite understand why this is, but when you look at the literature on dream recollection,
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:54.040]   it seems that by keeping one's body completely still with eyes closed, we have better access
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:58.240]   to whatever the contents of the dream that just occurred were, okay?
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:02.940]   So if you wake up and you can't remember your dreams, try lying still for a few minutes
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:07.300]   and keeping your eyes closed and seeing whether or not that helps surface the content of that
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.300]   dream.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:11.780]   Other people find that they get up, they get out of bed, and then sometime in the middle
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:15.580]   of the morning, maybe even later in the day, the contents of a dream will just come to
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:16.580]   them.
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.580]   Well, if that happens, great.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:21.980]   I also highly recommend that you have a way to write down the contents of that dream.
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:25.760]   Now what you're looking for when you do this sort of tool or protocol, I encourage you
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.500]   to be wary of any immediate interpretation of, for instance, okay, animals in a dream
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:35.080]   mean children, although they could, you know, there's not a lot of science that really supports
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.780]   that as a firm statement.
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.740]   And of course there are books out there and podcasts and a ton of information trying to
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:42.100]   help you interpret your dreams.
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:46.000]   And while some of that can be fun and not all of it is entirely useless, the goal here
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.700]   is not to interpret your dreams.
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.700]   The goal here is to start recording some of the key takeaways, maybe even the entire narrative
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:57.160]   of the dreams that you have just prior to waking as a way to try and understand some
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:03.700]   of the themes that are occurring and recurring in the dialogue that exists within your unconscious
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:04.700]   mind.
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:10.020]   So a key aspect of this tool is that you're not going to take any one dream as an enormously
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.220]   informative dream.
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:16.860]   It might be, but more important in this particular tool is to write down the themes of a particular
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:22.680]   dream and then see whether or not those particular themes resurface again and again across different
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.280]   nights or across different dreams.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:31.580]   The idea here is that things that are repeating thematically will show up as different components
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:37.340]   in different dreams, but that by keeping a dream journal, you can start to identify some
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:41.620]   of these patterns that are occurring from one dream to the next, as opposed to having
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:43.480]   the same dream over and over.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.080]   But the point here is that you can explore the contents and the themes, that's really
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:52.240]   the most important word here, the themes of your unconscious mind that is occurring if
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.340]   you start thinking about what's recurring during your dreams, because dreams are a time
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:40:01.340]   when your unconscious mind is dominating the narrative within your mind and brain.
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:05.020]   Now for those of you that dream a lot and remember your dreams, as well as for those
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:11.060]   of you that do not, I would also encourage you to explore the contents of your thinking,
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:15.660]   that is thinking about your thinking during so-called liminal states.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:20.220]   And the liminal state during which this can be particularly useful is right upon waking.
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:23.500]   So this is different than thinking about what you were dreaming about.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:26.820]   This is about keeping your eyes closed and body still.
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.940]   We do think that that's important for doing this well, because once you start moving your
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:34.300]   body, you open your eyes and you start bringing in sensory experience for that day, your mind
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.800]   dramatically shifts towards conscious processing.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.700]   But in that liminal state between sleeping and awake, when you wake up and you're a little
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:46.000]   sleepy, maybe you don't want to get out of bed, this happens to me all too often, try
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.160]   closing your eyes and remaining perfectly still for maybe one to three minutes, maybe
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.400]   five minutes, and just pay attention to where your mind goes.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.680]   Now you might fall back asleep, be mindful of that, depending on what you need to do
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:03.940]   that morning, but a lot of people will find that their mind goes into this place that's
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.880]   neither sleep nor awake, right?
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:10.300]   This is a state that very much resembles the state people achieve in things like yoga nidra,
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:16.060]   yoga sleep, or in non-sleep deep rest, although it tends to be more dominated by the unconscious
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.140]   mind, a little bit more sleep-like.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:22.160]   Now some people find this practice to be difficult because they're the sort of people that wake
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.940]   up and they're just immediately ready to go.
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:29.480]   Most people, however, myself included, find that when they wake up, the mind isn't completely
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480]   alert yet.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:35.620]   And you can use that period, again, just maybe two or three minutes, maybe five minutes,
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:40.740]   to start to pay attention to the contents of your thinking, see whether or not your
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:48.860]   thinking migrates from something related to work or to relationship or to self or to something
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:53.800]   you want to do or something that you're anxious about and so on and so on.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.560]   And here too, you'll want to write this down.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:00.000]   So this is very much like the dream journaling we just talked about, but it's slightly easier
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.040]   for most people to access, especially people who have a hard time remembering their dreams.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:10.000]   And again, it's an opportunity to access some of the contents of your unconscious mind,
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.820]   to learn to look at and see what's going on in your unconscious mind in a way that's very
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:20.180]   difficult if not impossible to do, unless you're working with somebody who's very good
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:25.320]   at accessing the unconscious, such as a skilled psychiatrist or psychoanalyst.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:31.220]   And in that way, allowing you to do introspective work, which is not structured in terms of
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:35.000]   thinking, trying to think about like, what do I want, what's going on?
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]   Why did they do that?
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.240]   Why did I react that way?
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240]   Nothing like that.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.360]   You're simply observing your mind and seeing what's geysering up from the unconscious.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:49.020]   That is, you're getting a portal into that portion of the iceberg that resides below
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:50.500]   the surface of the water.
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:55.600]   The next set of tools for exploring the self, self-concept, et cetera, from that four episode
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:58.080]   series with Dr. Conti is journaling.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:01.600]   I'm going to do an entire episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast about journaling.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.660]   And there are a lot of different kinds of journaling.
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:07.720]   And fortunately, there are a lot of great peer reviewed studies about the power of journaling
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.880]   for processing all sorts of things like emotional states, trauma, et cetera.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:17.000]   There are basically two categories of journaling that are very useful to carry out on a consistent
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000]   basis.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.060]   And when I say consistent basis, that could mean every day, or it could mean three times
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.060]   a week.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.060]   It could even be once a week.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:25.360]   There are really no hard and fast rules about this.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.060]   But when we think about journaling, there are really two main styles of journaling.
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:31.080]   One is going to be free associative journaling.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.700]   Sometimes people talk about this as a data dump, right?
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:39.060]   Typically people will talk about the data dump as the morning notes, which is when you
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:41.360]   wake up in the morning, you know, you've got a lot on your mind.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.800]   You can't organize your mind.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.040]   People who have a hard time structuring their thinking and behavior often find this very
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.280]   useful, which is to, you know, take out a journal or a piece of paper.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.560]   Again, this is just for you.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:56.680]   It's important that you realize and really make sure that you're the only person that's
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:00.280]   going to see these notes because a lot of people get into self-monitoring when they're
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.280]   doing their journaling.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.240]   They're thinking about, well, how's this going to look?
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.240]   Is my handwriting okay?
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.240]   How's my punctuation?
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.400]   What are people going to think?
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:10.040]   Is this going to be a good book or not a good, but listen, none of this journaling that we're
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.320]   referring to is about your book or your autobiography.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.280]   This is really just for you.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.700]   This is an exploration of yourself that's designed to help you enhance your concept.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:26.880]   That is your understanding of self and indeed translates to better confidence, better understanding
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:31.800]   of your goals and aspirations, better understanding of your unhealthy patterns and defenses and
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.880]   on and on.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.600]   And so again, the two styles of journaling are free association.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.720]   So we literally just write down any thing that comes to mind or that you feel like writing
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.700]   down within a given period of time.
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:46.240]   For most people, 10 minutes is ample time to do that.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:51.200]   For some people, five will be enough and for some who have the time, maybe 30 minutes.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:55.460]   But for me, and I think for most people out there, anywhere from five to 10 minutes of
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:59.280]   this data dump, free association, it could be your anxieties, what you're thinking about,
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:03.480]   what you're anxious about, really could be about anything that comes to mind.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:09.440]   And this free association process can be very useful for clearing out the clutter, so to
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:10.440]   speak.
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:14.740]   The other style of journaling that's equally useful, but for different reasons is structured
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:19.440]   journaling, to have a goal for a given entry on a given day.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:21.840]   And again, this could be done in the morning, afternoon or night.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:27.280]   And the idea would be that you would set an intention and by intention, I mean a specific
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.280]   topic that you're going to restrict your writing to.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.600]   And that writing should be about self, in particular goals and aspirations.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:41.920]   What you've wanted in the past, yes, but also what you want at present, what you might want
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.680]   in the future for yourself.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:49.260]   These could of course be material things, but in general, this is more about aspirations
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:52.620]   of things that you would like to accomplish or generate.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:54.220]   And the key word there is generate.
[01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:59.960]   And if you listen to the four episode series with Dr. Conti, he talked about three drives
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.560]   that exist in all of us.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:07.260]   These three drives are the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive and the generative drive.
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:11.060]   And we don't need to go into a lengthy description about these drives right now, if you're curious
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:16.300]   about them and what they represent and how they can be in balance or out of balance and
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:20.380]   how that serves us or doesn't serve us, please check out that four episode series with Dr.
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:25.560]   Conti because he goes into that in a fair amount of detail and also in an actionable
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.560]   way.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.240]   But the key thing here is that we're generative.
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:33.540]   One of the things that I asked Dr. Conti at the outset and throughout the entire series
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:36.240]   was what is mental health?
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.720]   We talk about physical health and we have some idea of what that represents, healthy
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:44.760]   blood pressure, the ability to do certain forms of physical movement, cognitive abilities.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.580]   I asked him, how can we define mental health?
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:50.260]   And his answer was very straightforward and very powerful.
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:56.500]   He said, what we all need to aspire to is to be in states that is in the verb actions
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:47:01.580]   of agency and gratitude for as much of our waking life as possible.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:02.580]   Now that sounds great, right?
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:07.480]   A sense of agency, the ability to exert influence over our internal state and affect the world
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:12.020]   around us in positive ways, positive relationships, reach our goals, as well as gratitude, being
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:15.760]   grateful for the opportunities that we've been afforded, even grateful perhaps for some
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.740]   of the challenges that we've been afforded or that were selected for us that we had no
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:25.700]   control over and carrying that agency and gratitude forward because it gives rise to
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:28.380]   a sense of peace, contentment, and delight.
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:30.500]   So all of that sounds wonderful, right?
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:35.520]   Be in agency and gratitude as a verb states, experience peace, contentment, and delight.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.320]   So Dr. Conti acknowledged, and we spent a good amount of time discussing the fact that
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:41.880]   doesn't happen just because we decide we want to.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:47.760]   In fact, agency and gratitude, peace, contentment, and delight, guys are up from a whole set
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.700]   of other processes that we have to engage in on a regular basis.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:54.580]   And that really gets us back to those three drives.
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:59.380]   He talked about how people tend to have more or less aggressive drive, not just aggression
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:03.940]   in terms of violence, although some people do have that, but in terms of their determination
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:08.040]   and their sort of leaning into friction, even seeking out a friction.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.760]   People are on a continuum with respect to the aggressive drive.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:15.160]   He also talked about the pleasure drive and the fact that people are on a continuum of
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:21.120]   the desire for pleasure to either be a hedonist or somebody who really avoids pleasure and
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.960]   kind of restricts pleasure from oneself.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.600]   And again, that these things can slide around depending on our life circumstances, our age,
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:33.800]   et cetera, but that it's very important that we have a sense of where we are on that continuum
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:40.040]   of an aggressive drive and a pleasure drive and that, and here's the most important thing,
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:45.500]   that our aggressive drive and pleasure drive never outsize our generative drive.
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:49.700]   And that engaging our generative drive is really the hallmark of mental health that
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:54.580]   leads to that sense of agency and gratitude, peace, contentment, and delight.
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:57.780]   And he defined the generative drive in the following way.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:01.660]   He said, "The generative drive is our desire to create, build, and contribute to the world
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:05.560]   in meaningful ways and appreciate the process to get there.
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:08.360]   It is the core feature of our mental health."
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.760]   So if you want to learn more about the various drives and how they interact and how to access
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:17.260]   more generative drive, again, that's all contained in the four-episode series with Dr. Conte.
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:22.120]   But taking us back to the tools and takeaways from that four-episode series, the process
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:27.320]   of journaling in free association mode or the process of journaling in a conscious structured
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:34.620]   way is really about trying to access the generative drive and to build up that generative drive.
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:39.180]   And one of the key things about conscious journaling is that it affords us the opportunity
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:44.440]   in a way that's not going to be seen by anybody else to really think about what our goals
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.100]   and aspirations are.
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:49.780]   Now you might say, "I can't even think about my goals and aspirations.
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.780]   I don't know what I want."
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:51.780]   Well, that's fine.
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:53.300]   Then you should journal about that.
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:58.700]   Remember, most people have some sense of what they would like, but most people are simply
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:02.980]   not comfortable with writing those things out or even thinking about them.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:06.700]   And if you reflect on that, how could it ever be that you would achieve those goals and
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:12.140]   aspirations if you're not even feeling comfortable enough to think about them or write about
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:13.140]   them?
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:18.220]   And so the process of thinking about and writing about your goals and aspirations is perhaps
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:24.080]   one of the key first steps towards being able to actualize those goals and aspirations.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:26.360]   And for some people, this might be very easy to do.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:30.200]   You can simply write down and say, "I want to be married by this age, and I want to make
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:32.660]   X amount of money, and I want to live here or there."
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:37.700]   And certainly those sorts of goals and aspirations are perfectly valid for this type of exercise,
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:41.420]   but so are the sorts of goals and aspirations that relate to feeling states.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:44.260]   Like, "Yeah, I would like to feel part of a community.
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:48.280]   I would like to feel like an active contributor to a community."
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:51.780]   And then the essential thing is to really flesh out the detail around those goals and
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:52.780]   aspirations.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:54.620]   You know, what size community?
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:56.580]   Where do you see yourself fitting into this community?
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:59.300]   Are you doing this alongside other people or by yourself?
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:03.780]   In other words, to really get comfortable thinking about what your goals and aspirations
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:08.380]   are, again, completely from the perspective of self and that you are going to be the only
[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:11.260]   person to see this particular document.
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:15.540]   Now I will be the first to admit that the exercise that I just described, not the free
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:20.580]   association journaling, but the structured journaling of goals and aspirations, I and
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:24.400]   many people find to be difficult to initiate.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:28.180]   Difficult to initiate because there seems to be a bit of internal anxiety and friction
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.180]   around doing it.
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:33.760]   There seems to be something that keeps many, not all, but many people from feeling as if
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:39.140]   they are even allowed to think about their goals and aspirations because many people
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:42.700]   default to, "Well, then, you know, I'll just be disappointed 'cause it's not gonna work
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:43.700]   out.
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:46.740]   I don't wanna think about what I want because then I'll just be more disappointed."
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:51.100]   And that particular frame of mind was actually discussed in the series with Dr. Conti.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:57.460]   And he convinced me, and he's the expert, that the opposite is actually true.
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:02.000]   When we are able to overcome some of our anxiety and really think about in a dedicated way,
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.900]   what we would like to create for ourselves in our lives, both present and future.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:11.140]   And keeping in mind our events of past, because we always carry that life narrative forward,
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:15.380]   then we are in a far better place to actualize those goals and aspirations.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:19.100]   And he explained a variety of reasons why that's the case in his clinical observations
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:22.420]   and some of the other observations that really support that statement.
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:25.940]   So I highly encourage you to think about embracing a process of journaling.
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:27.720]   Again, you don't have to do this every day.
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:31.540]   The journaling and the dream analysis take a little bit more time, but they are oh so
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:37.180]   valuable for better understanding oneself concept, and they really thread forward into
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:42.200]   real everyday actions that can positively enrich your mood and mental health.
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:46.520]   Now any description of science-based tools for mood and mental health will be incomplete
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:50.440]   without including some tools related to processing of traumas.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:55.420]   Now the processing of traumas is something that, especially in the case of major traumas
[01:52:55.420 --> 01:53:01.720]   or repeated traumas, really should be carried out in concert with an expert-trained clinician.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:07.620]   That is a psychologist or psychiatrist who's trained in helping people work through traumas.
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:12.200]   However, even if you're working with somebody who's expert in processing trauma, there are
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:18.000]   specific tools that you can use on your own to accelerate that process.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.040]   And for people who are working through what are sometimes called more minor traumas, these
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:25.660]   are sometimes called big T, big traumas, and little T, little traumas.
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:31.080]   However, that nomenclature doesn't take into account the fact that most of us can probably
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:35.140]   tell what the big traumas are for ourselves and for others, but sometimes it's hard to
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:39.800]   tell whether or not those small traumas, the little T traumas, actually are big T traumas.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:44.020]   So this is one of the major reasons why working with a licensed professional is really going
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:48.140]   to be advantageous and in many cases necessary to work through trauma.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:54.320]   That said, the self-directed protocols for working through trauma have a lot to do with
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:54:00.460]   how we think about, but more importantly at times, how we talk about those traumas.
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:04.340]   And Dr. Paul Conte talked about this, not so much in the four episode series with us,
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:09.300]   but in a particular podcast episode that he did with Dr. Peter Attia, who some of you
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:14.520]   are perhaps familiar with for his incredible podcast, The Drive, but also for his excellent
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.960]   book, Outlive, which deals with healthspan and lifespan or longevity.
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.640]   Now in that particular conversation with Dr. Conte and Dr. Attia, Dr. Conte emphasized
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:30.660]   the fact that one of the ways that we hold ourselves back and indeed can exacerbate the
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:36.320]   negative consequences of trauma are the ways in which we modify our language to describe
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:37.560]   those traumas.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:43.400]   And what he said, which is so important, is that oftentimes we don't allow ourselves to
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:49.840]   use language that's as big as is necessary to explain that trauma and the impact of that
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:52.200]   trauma on us and on others.
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:59.080]   In fact, many people start to relegate their language to more passable in a given sentence
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:01.400]   or passable in a given conversation.
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.840]   Now what we're not talking about here is the idea that, okay, screaming at somebody else
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:10.780]   about your trauma or using a lot of four letter words is necessarily the best way to process
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:12.080]   that trauma verbally.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:17.860]   However, we are talking about allowing oneself, either in spoken form or in written form,
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:24.920]   to really allow the magnitude of a given trauma to be expressed with a fair degree of intensity
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:30.720]   and language that can capture at least some of what that trauma represented for us or
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:31.720]   for others.
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:36.080]   Now, as Dr. Conte pointed out, all too often we do the opposite.
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:41.280]   What ends up happening is people will experience some sort of trauma, either major or minor,
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.600]   maybe single or repeated trauma.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.940]   And rather than being comfortable talking about it, rather than using language that
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:53.000]   captures at least some of the magnitude of that trauma for them, people start to talk
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.320]   about that trauma less frequently.
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:00.600]   They start to distract themselves to think about other things instead of talking about
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:02.440]   or thinking about that trauma.
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:07.340]   And what happens is that trauma roots into our unconscious mind and starts to impact
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:09.480]   us in negative ways.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.640]   Now those negative ways include increases in anxiety, disruptions in sleep.
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:19.080]   In fact, one of the common ways in which trauma manifests in disruptions in sleep by way of
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:25.420]   rooting into our unconscious is that people wake up at 2.30 or 3 o'clock in the morning,
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:29.440]   let's just say after several hours of being asleep, and immediately they're thinking about
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:32.200]   that thing that happened and they're upset about it.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:36.400]   The idea is that when we push those traumas down, when we don't talk about them with people
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:42.160]   that we trust, when we don't have a way to consciously process those traumas using language
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:48.320]   that at least partially matches the magnitude of the impact of those traumas for us, well
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:53.200]   then those traumas impact our unconscious mind in ways that lead our unconscious mind
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:57.080]   to literally wake us up in the middle of the night and remind us of that thing.
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:00.140]   It's as if it's being thrown back in our face over and over.
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:04.280]   Also sometimes traumas will root their way down into our unconscious and then they will
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:10.920]   resurface in the mode of compulsive or obsessive thinking about that thing or perhaps other
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:11.920]   things.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:16.920]   Again, the unconscious mind has a interesting and complicated number of different ways that
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:23.780]   it defends us in ways that it can create denial, distraction, that we might get hyper-focused
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:29.420]   on work as a way to not think about the trauma or hyper-focused on some details in our environment
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:33.720]   and just really trying to focus on that because it's much easier to process and handle that
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:34.960]   than these traumas.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:40.920]   Again, the processing of trauma is a whole landscape into itself that actually was beautifully
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:47.240]   described in terms of how it arises within us and how to process traumas in a really
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:52.560]   structured way in a just fabulous book that was written by Dr. Conti called "The Invisible
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:56.000]   Epidemic, How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It."
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.640]   In that book, Dr. Conti explains a number of different ways that we can do self-directed
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:04.480]   work as well as work with licensed professionals to process traumas and help us move through
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:08.640]   those traumas so that they are not negatively impacting us going forward.
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.600]   So I really encourage anyone that's trying to process traumas from the past and/or present
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:16.420]   to check out Dr. Conti's book because it's a spectacular resource.
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:20.200]   But in terms of the tools related to processing trauma that we're talking about right now,
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:27.620]   I think this point about really making sure that we allow ourselves to verbally process
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:33.460]   and emotionally process that trauma in a way that there's room for using language that
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:38.820]   captures some of the magnitude of that trauma and how it impacted us and others is going
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:40.600]   to be very important.
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:45.680]   Because otherwise, what ends up happening is that we tend to adopt feelings of guilt
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:51.320]   and shame around those traumas simply by not talking about them, by having them go inward.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:55.400]   And then they start to negatively impact our unconscious mind, and then our unconscious
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:59.320]   mind tries to throw them up to the surface for our conscious mind to recognize by waking
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:05.340]   us up from sleep, and in some cases, by leveraging those unhealthy defenses, things like denial,
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:10.780]   things like the overindulgence in alcohol, overindulgence of drugs, ways to distract
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:16.720]   ourselves, as well as projection and sublimation and the other types of defenses that Dr. Conti
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:18.960]   talked about in the four-episode series.
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:22.640]   Again, those defenses are not necessarily good or bad.
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:24.520]   It depends on the circumstances.
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:27.280]   The unconscious mind is not trying to harm us.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:33.080]   Your unconscious mind is part of you, it is you, but of course it is you acting in concert
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:34.320]   with your conscious mind.
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:38.960]   And so really the tools and protocols from the four-episode series with Dr. Conti are
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:44.840]   aimed at helping you feel and access more sense of agency and gratitude on a regular
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:51.720]   basis, more peace, contentment, and delight, and doing so by touching into those different
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:56.040]   drives, understanding what they are, the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive, and really making
[01:59:56.040 --> 02:00:00.000]   sure that your generative drive, again, I love this description of the generative drive
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.740]   so much so that I'm going to read it again, because this is really what it means to be
[02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:05.200]   mentally healthy.
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:09.560]   Again, the generative drive is our desire to create, build, and contribute to the world
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:12.880]   in a meaningful way and appreciate the process to get there.
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:15.680]   It is the core feature of our mental health.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:20.320]   So being able to access that generative drive on a regular basis is really what this thing
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.100]   that we call mental health is all about.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:27.440]   And the tools that I just described, of course, can be combined with in any number of different
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:32.720]   ways with the tools that I described gleaned largely from the episode with Dr. Lisa Feldman-Barrett.
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:37.780]   And so what you now have is a kit of tools and protocols for improving mood and mental
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:40.800]   health, some of which are grounded in that core six.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:46.280]   The first principles of self-care are always going to be getting your physiology right
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:49.000]   so that your psychology can be right.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:54.140]   As well, of course, you want to emphasize tools and protocols that build up your psychological
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:56.320]   processes and concept of self.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.560]   That's what the tools from the Conti series that we just described are all about.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:05.000]   And then the tools from the episode with Dr. Lisa Feldman-Barrett sort of bridge the two
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.280]   because she talked about both the physiological and the psychological tools that really represent
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:12.620]   ways to enhance our mood and mental health.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:17.500]   And so by threading these three things together, I believe it really arms us with the greatest
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:23.000]   degree of optimism and capacity to take control of this thing that we call our mood and emotions
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.940]   and to, of course, allow ourselves to feel the negative things we need to feel, but then
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:32.600]   process them in healthy ways and to exist as much as is reasonably possible in generally
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:38.600]   optimistic upbeat states that allow us to engage our generative drive.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:43.440]   And although we covered a lot of tools during this episode, again, I want to emphasize that
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:46.480]   the idea isn't to necessarily do all of them all at once.
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:50.060]   You just pick one or two and start to implement them on a regular basis.
[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:53.820]   And by implementing those, there's no reason to think that you would be significantly eating
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:58.840]   into the other demands on your time, because ultimately the whole purpose of having elevated
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:02.740]   mood and mental health is so that you can have better relationship to yourself and better
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:05.780]   relationship to others and to the world around you.

[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.300]   Not so much on today's episode, but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:42.580]   we discussed supplements.
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:46.100]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:50.380]   them for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support, and focus.
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:54.020]   To learn more about the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to

[02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:13.060]   And on all those platforms, I discuss science and science-related tools, some of which overlaps
[02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:16.900]   with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:18.440]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:21.620]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:43.420]   sleep, neuroplasticity, deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure, fitness, dopamine
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:45.140]   regulation, and much more.
