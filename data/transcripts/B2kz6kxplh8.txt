[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   [Music]
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.160]   Welcome back to Ask Pastor John. I trust your celebration of the resurrection of Christ was wonderful this weekend.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.920]   And today and tomorrow we're joined again by author and pastor Ray Ortlund.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.280]   Ray, in your excellent commentary on Proverbs, you wrote this, quote,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.480]   "Twitter and blogs and emails would be cleared of much conflict if we humbled our opinions before Christ.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.760]   What are we here for, really? What does God want to be stirred up in our hearts?
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.180]   He says, 'Stir one another up to love and good deeds,'" Hebrews 10 24, end quote.
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.560]   Now you're online, so explain the connection and how this works for you in deciding what to post on social media and to Facebook.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.380]   Right, I think of Facebook, it's not really a website.
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.540]   It's a landmine, brilliantly disguised as a website.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.680]   So I got out of Facebook last summer, and I didn't just deactivate my account,
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.680]   I deleted it because I found that for me personally, it started to take too much time.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.540]   I found it just got me riled up at times in ways I don't want. It's not hard to find political stupidity.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.120]   It's not hard to find reasons to get angry over developments in our culture and so forth.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.640]   And there was too much there that was counteracting my desire to walk with the Lord.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.300]   So I bailed out. I still use, I have a blog at the Gospel Coalition.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.800]   I do use Twitter and I do use Instagram.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.320]   Those are more controlled environments online, and I can still pursue my purposes more easily there.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.360]   But what I try to do with social media,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.020]   well, I think of a wonderful verse in Isaiah chapter 50, verse 4, that I may know how to sustain with a word him who is weary.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.480]   Everyone is weary. We're living under intense pressure. We don't need more.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.620]   What we all need is to be helped with a sustaining word, and it doesn't need to be much.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.580]   And I can't ask anyone for their attention for very long.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.620]   So whether it's a blog post or whatever it might be, I want to sustain with a brief word the one who is weary.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.520]   I want to maximize what I can impart to them with a minimum of commitment on their part.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.700]   So I don't want to be the online watchdog of the Christian church and the corrector of everything that's wrong.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.200]   I want to be an encourager. I think the Lord is.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.780]   I believe encouragement is one of the most important ministries of the Christian church,
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.660]   and I think that's what social media is for.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.920]   Well, I think you do it really well. You encourage, I think, as well as anyone online.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   Thank you, Tony.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.660]   You can follow Ray Ortlund on Twitter and Instagram. I would recommend it.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.660]   And our time with Ray draws to a close, but I have one more question for him,
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.660]   and I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll be back tomorrow.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   <ishhhhhhhh>
