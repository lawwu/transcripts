[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   You have been both a supporter and a critic of competition.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.960]   What do you think is the value of competition for a martial artist?
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.160]   I believe that the value of competition is in that it teaches you the true
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.440]   purpose of martial arts. And again, the true purpose of martial arts is being able to
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.000]   defend yourself and whatnot and all of these other things in real life, yes.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.400]   Because let's say you win an 80cc gold medal,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.280]   but
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.920]   you know, you get slapped around by someone bigger and stronger than you at a bar.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.960]   People will talk about how sweet that gold medal is, but for the rest of your
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.400]   life it'll feel pretty hollow. That's not what we're looking for.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.560]   What I'm talking about, I guess, is what I believe competition develops if
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.760]   approached properly,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.240]   is proper focus, proper dedication. Because anytime you have a very defined goal
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.600]   and strong opposition, it will force you to be better, period.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   The better your opposition is, if you focus and you take what you're doing
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.500]   seriously, the better you become, period.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.560]   People are better wrestlers today than they once were. People are better
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.760]   basketball players today than they once were. Military is better now than it was
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.920]   in the past because of all of the competition
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.720]   that has existed over the course of time.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.040]   And if you go out in competition and just kind of
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.960]   bullshit it, if you're like, "Oh, I'm going to go out and see how it happens,"
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.760]   that's a cowardly way to approach competition and that gets you nothing.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.160]   That doesn't teach you
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.640]   to really do the right things. And the same thing, not properly
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.120]   preparing. Even if you win,
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.800]   that was a cowardly way to approach it because you intentionally left yourself
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.160]   out, which was,
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.680]   "If I win, oh man, I'm talented and blah-de-blah. And if I lose, it's,
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.800]   well, you know, I didn't really train that hard." Well, if that's
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.520]   the case, then you shouldn't have been out there. Win, lose, or draw. I don't care
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.680]   if I've got a student that I think is going to win gold at the world
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.640]   championships. If he or she does not train properly ahead of time, I will not
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.360]   allow them to go. And if they go, I will send them off the team.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.160]   You know? And hey, they can do what they want. They're a grown adult. I'm not the
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.720]   boss of them, but I am the boss of my team and the boss of my gym.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.640]   And that's not how we conduct ourselves. And it has way less to do about the
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.600]   physical, you know, the result than it does about the proper preparation.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.480]   Because proper preparation and proper focus and dedication
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.400]   over the long haul yields positive results. But most importantly, it's about
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.080]   are we conducting ourselves in an honorable and respectable manner.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.360]   So, I believe that competition really teaches us that. Because
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.880]   in the room, you know, there's always like, "Oh, it was practice. Oh,
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.240]   I was kind of this to that happened today." The other thing, when you go to
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.120]   competition, everyone is, that's on. Everyone is on
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.240]   that day. Because everyone is trained for that specific moment. And
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.160]   we'll see what happens. So, you get the most honesty out of a time like that.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.920]   And the higher the level, the better it gets.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.520]   And, you know, provided that there's not a lot of cheating. But regardless, you know,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.080]   from an athletic performance perspective, it is the most honest thing.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.280]   Because, and it's the toughest as well. Because it takes
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.000]   courage and it takes some heart to really properly prepare
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.520]   and put it on the line. Because you're risking horrible disappointment.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.200]   I've prepared so hard before and tried so hard and I've won.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.240]   And I've prepared other times and I've tried so hard and I've failed. And it
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.480]   hurts. It really hurts. It doesn't hurt nearly as
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.360]   much if you kind of half-ass it. Because you didn't put that much into it. But
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360]   again, that's how a coward approaches things.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.720]   If you have, if you're going to conduct yourself the right way, you prepare
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.840]   properly, you train hard. And then win, lose, or draw, you deal with
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.200]   the results. And that's what I believe is the real benefit of competition if
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.800]   approached properly. Do you admire somebody who sacrifices,
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.080]   you know, like 10, 20 years of their life in that singular pursuit
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.520]   of competition towards a gold medal at the Olympics,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.120]   say? Just most of the Olympians do. Goodness, absolutely. I mean, I admire
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.240]   anyone that's willing to sacrifice and willing to work hard in any
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.360]   area of life. Actually, a book that I'm reading again that I really, really like
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.800]   is Dune. It's, I don't know, I'm kind of like
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.200]   sci-fi nerding out on everybody. But basically,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.480]   you know, one of the things that, you know, one of the
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.920]   things that the author was kind of Frank Herbert, and it's
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.400]   widely regarded as one of the, you know, greatest science fiction novels ever, if
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.280]   not the preeminent. But anyway, one of the things he said, you
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.600]   know, is if you search for freedom, you
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.440]   actually end up becoming a slave to your own
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.120]   desires, ironically. And if you search for discipline, you
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.320]   find liberty, because you're able to make yourself do what you want in the long
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.180]   run. Whereas if I'm like, oh, I'm gonna do whatever I want all the time and, and
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.960]   screw you, Dad, I'm gonna do what I want, and that's kind of like a teenager-type
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.360]   attitude, you end up getting into a bunch of nonsense. But anyone that's able, and
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.880]   again, this doesn't matter, it doesn't mean that it's athletic, it could be in
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   any area of human endeavor, any area of life. It could be parenting, it could be
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.680]   military, it could be athletics, it could be business, it could be school, it could be
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.800]   anything. But as long as you're making, you know, an incredibly large commitment,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.400]   I have an immense amount of respect for the, for the level of dedication, that, and
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.520]   the level of commitment, and the level of risk that it, that you're taking
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.280]   emotionally, psychologically. Because, hey, like you said, you work 20 years, you get
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.080]   that gold medal. But there's other people that work 20 years and got the silver.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.640]   Most people. Most. Yeah. Metal. Now, most people, most people that think they work
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.600]   hard don't, I'll be frank. You know, like, seriously. I said that in class the other
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.440]   day. Like, again, it's like, I don't want to be too negative, but most of the people
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   that, most people that think they work hard do not. How do you know that if
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.880]   you're working hard or not? I think you know. But most people are not very honest
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.680]   with themselves. They, most people would press a button, in my experience, you
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.400]   know, like, would prefer to be, look like the thing, than be the thing. Right. And,
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.960]   you know, that's, that's fine. But it really, I can't, I think Sun Tzu said it,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.000]   it's like, "Victory is reserved for those willing to pay its price." And there is a
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.120]   price. And now, that doesn't guarantee that if you pay the price that you will
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.160]   have victory. But you guarantee, but, I mean, from a physical perspective, but you
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.680]   will have the moral victory regardless. Because you will have, you will have
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.080]   learned discipline. You will have shown, not only to others, forget others, you do
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.560]   it not for others, but for yourself. You, you show that you are the master of your
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.480]   own mind, and of your own body, and of your own circumstance. And you can
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.760]   discipline yourself, and focus, and you deny yourself certain things in the
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.360]   pursuit of something, something that is valuable to you. And that is incredibly
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.200]   useful in any area of life. And that's, I mean, not shocking to me why the same
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.240]   reason that you'll see guys that were, you know, like high-level military, like
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.760]   kind of big dogs in SF world, get hired by, let's say for instance, a Fortune 500
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   company. Because what would they know about business? Nothing. But also
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.520]   everything. Because that level of focus and dedicate, like you don't get to that
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.880]   level of ability in something by accident. And that's what I think, you
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.640]   know, like again, the value of competition, and what they do, competition
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.960]   only. It's as serious as it gets, you know. Because if you don't get the gold
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.080]   medal, you may not, you may not walk out of it. But basically, I have an
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.000]   immense amount of respect for anyone that is willing, and able to, over the
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   long haul, put that time in. But I have to, trying hard doesn't mean just getting
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.880]   on an air done bike, and walking off the mat, or having to be carried off the mat.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.080]   It means thinking, approaching, reassessing, re-evaluating, saying how
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.920]   could I be better? And it takes honest, honest self-analysis. And also it takes a
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.440]   lot of times, because let's say, you know, I think I'm doing well, but I have to say,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.940]   "Hey Lex, you know, I mean, no matter how well I believe, I look at myself, I'm
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.840]   still biased. I'm still looking at myself. What should I be doing better?" I'm
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.280]   gonna find other people that I respect, and people that I think can tell me, and
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.440]   I'm gonna ask them. And then I'm gonna have the courage to listen to them, and
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.840]   not just dismiss what they're saying out of hand. And if you're doing those things,
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.960]   then I believe that a lot of times you're working hard. But I know plenty
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.960]   of people that come in, it's just like in Jiu-Jitsu. There's plenty of people who've
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.400]   been training for 15 years that frankly suck. And there's plenty of people that
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.280]   have been training for four that are pretty dang good, you know. And again,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.040]   are they the best person that's been training for four years? It's still,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.680]   compared to like Cobrinha, not that good. But they could be really, really, really
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.640]   good, because they understand how to be directed, and how to focus. And I believe,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.320]   and this is something I've discussed, you know, before with some other, you know,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.400]   friends of mine, you know, that some of whom are at a very high level of MMA,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.840]   others that are at a high level of Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, or whatever. Look at
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.120]   guys like Randy Couture, guys like Rick Hahn. They're on their second career.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.320]   They started MMA when they were like 32, and yet they got to the top. Maybe they
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.280]   weren't always champion, but they were freaking good. Why? Because their 26-year-old
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.000]   self would be scary. But, you know, like, hey, they know what it is to be
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   dedicated and work hard. Because again, they're Olympians, like you said, on a
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.560]   level that a regular person has no concept of. So I think that that is
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.880]   ultimately the skill. It's not the, "Oh man, this person's dangerous because he's
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.840]   got good Judo or good wrestling." No, this person is dangerous because he or she
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.240]   knows how to work their ass off, and be focused on a level that most people
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.120]   can't comprehend. And that's what produces success in any area of life, in
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.640]   my opinion. Yeah, and be brutally honest with yourself at all times. And it stings
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.280]   sometimes, you know. I think it's like the price of looking inward,
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.000]   you know, objectively, is that you're not gonna like what you see a lot, you know.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.760]   And because even if you're like, "Oh man, I'm 90% the way I want to be," it's like
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.880]   if you are going to take that next step, in my opinion, you're gonna focus on
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.720]   the 10%, because it's like, "Oh man, we're doing a lot of things good. Yeah, who
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.080]   gives a shit? Let's talk about what we need to improve on." You know, and that's a
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.680]   little bit less fun, but in the long run, I think it's what's gonna
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.200]   drive you to a higher level. But at the same time, I think it's what makes a lot
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.340]   of people that are like that a little bit neurotic and nutty by a
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.080]   normal standard. But again, you show me someone that's super well-adjusted, and
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.720]   I'll show you someone that's probably not a high achiever.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.780]   you
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
