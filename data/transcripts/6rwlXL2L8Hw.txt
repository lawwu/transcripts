[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.400]   - Hello everyone and happy Friday
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.440]   as we close out this work week.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.240]   Pastor John joins us remotely over Skype
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.520]   and our question today is from a listener named Wesley
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.180]   who has a really important work question.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.440]   Though it's unclear, I don't know where Wesley works,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.920]   what field he's in, but Wesley writes this.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.080]   Hello Pastor John, recently my boss offered me
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.640]   and all my colleagues a cash bonus
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.040]   for anyone generating new referrals.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.000]   I felt immediately lured into the proposition,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.720]   but my question is this, should the straight up offer
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.760]   of cash be a good motivator for our work?
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.640]   Can the desire for more money, in this case a bonus,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.720]   be desirous in a virtuous way?
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.220]   Or is this simply the love of money inside of me?
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.960]   How can I tell the difference?
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.160]   - One of the most basic things to say
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160]   is that money only has value in a culture
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.520]   where it can be exchanged for something else.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.280]   The paper we call bills or money,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.520]   or the pieces of metal that we call coins,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.960]   or the checks that stand for money,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.280]   or the electronic impulses on your phone
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.760]   that turn into money somehow,
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.960]   all of that is relatively worthless.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.080]   It only has value because we live in a culture
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.040]   in which there is an agreed upon use
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.440]   that can be made of these different coins
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.120]   and different bills.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.080]   You can exchange them for things
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.640]   and for services that you value,
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.480]   or you can give them away because you believe
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.000]   that what others will exchange them for
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.920]   is something you really value and want to promote.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.960]   That might be a missionary who exchanges them
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.120]   for Bibles to give away,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.920]   or it might be a research institute
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.920]   that attempts to find a cure for disease, and so on.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480]   So money is the capacity to obtain
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.760]   and promote what you value.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   Now the Bible is clear that the ultimate goal of life
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.800]   is to magnify, that is to make much of,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.680]   to glorify, to show to be supremely beautiful,
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.440]   worthy, great Jesus,
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.480]   and all that God is for us in Him.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.040]   Everything in the world exists ultimately
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.560]   for this purpose, including money.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.920]   So the fundamental question for the Christian
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.120]   in regard to money is,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.400]   does my possession of it, or my lack of possession of it,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   or my desire for it, or my lack of desire for it,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.560]   does all of that serve this purpose
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.320]   of magnifying, making much of,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.400]   the worth of Jesus above all things?
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.600]   The way I like to say it is,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.280]   the reason God gives His people money
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.240]   is so that we can use money in a way
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.160]   to show that money is not our God,
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.680]   but that God is our God.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.520]   That's why we have money, that's why we have everything.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.280]   And I think it's important to emphasize
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.200]   that God does intend for Christians to use money.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.960]   Money itself is just money.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.840]   It's not good or bad, it's just stuff.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.240]   It's paper or coins or potential for value.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.080]   Jesus said that the,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.280]   and this is a really important sentence,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.000]   and every word in it probably,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.360]   especially the word worthy.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.040]   Jesus said in Luke 10, seven,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   that the laborer is worthy of his wages,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.640]   implying that it's right.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.040]   I mean, the word worthy implies it's right,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.680]   it's good, it's just,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.320]   to earn a living and to receive wages
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.240]   that correspond to your work.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.040]   And evidently the harder you work,
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.200]   the more wages, and the less you work, the less wages.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.360]   There's a correspondence.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.120]   That's what he means by the word worthiness.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.200]   The laborer is worthy of his wages.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.480]   This would be called justice.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   It's just to be paid more
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.160]   for doing a very good job for your employer.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.600]   And it's just to be paid less
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.200]   for doing a poor job for your employer.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.800]   And of course there are other criteria,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.080]   but that's the basic principle.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.560]   That would be justice, or what Jesus calls worthiness.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   So I don't deny the goodness and the justice
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.520]   of an employee desiring to be paid appropriately
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.120]   for a job well done,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.640]   whether it's an ordinary wage or whether it's a bonus.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.480]   The principle is the same, it seems to me.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.160]   Not whether you get a bonus,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.600]   and that creates all kinds of problems,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.040]   but rather your wage.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.400]   Why do you go to work in the morning anyway,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.600]   not just for when there's a bonus promised?
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   Either way, it seems to me that the remuneration
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.480]   for work done is right,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.280]   and so to desire it is right,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.000]   or at least can be right.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.600]   And the question then becomes,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.960]   and this is the question that was raised,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.960]   what might make the desire for a bonus or a wage defective?
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.880]   A defective, sinful desire for a wage or a bonus?
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.840]   And Wesley asks specifically,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.960]   can a desire for money, in this case a bonus,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.360]   be desirous in a virtuous way?
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.840]   Or is this simply the love of money?
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.120]   How can I tell the difference?
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.800]   So let me give a handful of pointers
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   that I think the Bible gives to help us discern
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   whether our hearts are right in the desire
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.720]   for a bonus or a wage,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.480]   or any other material benefit for that matter,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.000]   some tax return, say.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.240]   Number one, first, is the project
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.720]   for which the bonus is offered itself virtuous?
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.760]   Are you being asked to do something good?
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.160]   If not, then the pursuit of the money for the bonus
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.880]   is gonna be tainted.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.840]   Second, do you feel a fitting danger
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.840]   that the desire to be rich is a perilous desire?
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.240]   1 Timothy 6, 9.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.680]   Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.120]   into a snare.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.360]   The love of money is the root of all evils.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.040]   It is hard for those who are rich
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.000]   to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.520]   In other words, it's just a cluster of New Testament texts
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.160]   that wave a big yellow flag in front of the desire for money
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.480]   to say, watch out, this can kill you.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.040]   And I'm just saying, do you feel that?
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.160]   It's appropriate to be awakened to that danger
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.320]   lest you fall for it.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.400]   That's number two.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.000]   Number three, is the desire for the money
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   an evidence that God is becoming less satisfying to you?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.680]   Or to put it another way around,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.840]   is the desire for the money becoming idolatrous?
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.360]   I use that word because of Colossians 3, 5
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.960]   that says greed or covetousness is idolatry.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.900]   Or to put it in another way,
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.580]   would you still be content in God, happy in God
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.920]   if the bonus did not come through?
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   Number four, is your heart continuing to experience
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.000]   the truth of Acts 20, 35, that it is more blessed,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   more joyful, more satisfying to give than to receive?
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   Or is the desire for this bonus rising to the level
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.140]   that it would be more pleasant to get it
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.480]   rather than to give?
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.140]   Has your heart begin to shift away from Acts 20, 35?
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.140]   Number five, does the desire for the bonus indicate
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:35.040]   that your heart might be losing some of its confidence
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.680]   in the promises of God that are designed
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.040]   to keep you free from the love of money?
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.280]   And here I have in mind Hebrews 13, 5.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.460]   Keep your life free from the love of money
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.480]   and be content with what you have for,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.960]   and then he grounds it in promises.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.620]   I will never leave you or forsake you.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.420]   So we can confidently say, the Lord is my helper.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.020]   I will not fear what can man do to me.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   Is the desire for the bonus a loss of confidence
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.660]   in those promises?
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.440]   Number six, since Jesus said in Luke 8, 14,
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.940]   that the riches of the world choke the word of God,
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.620]   do you detect in the desire for this bonus
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.220]   any lessening of your joy and desire to be much
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.820]   in the word of God?
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.180]   Boy, this is such a good barometer.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.540]   People just start to find the word of God boring
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.660]   when they become more worldly.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.440]   Or would this bonus enhance your motives
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.500]   for reading and meditating on God's word?
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.400]   As you desire the bonus, as you contemplate receiving
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.260]   the bonus, as you contemplate giving or spending
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.780]   or saving or investing the bonus,
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.880]   are you drawn to the word of God rather than
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.300]   drawn away from it?
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.980]   And number seven, finally, since Jesus said
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.760]   that your life does not consist in the abundance
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.940]   of your possessions, Luke 12, 15,
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.940]   do you detect that this bonus is encroaching
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:21.760]   on your very sense of being alive in Christ
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.500]   so that it plays a role, a life-giving role,
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.460]   an energizing role that seems out of proportion
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.420]   with the statement that your life doesn't consist
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.140]   in the abundance of your possessions?
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.140]   Is there a sense that to lose the bonus
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.140]   would actually diminish your sense of life in Him?
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.620]   So those are some of the ways that you can test your heart
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.140]   when you are desiring a wage or a bonus
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.020]   or some other material benefit.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.420]   In the end, the Bible says, whether you eat or drink
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.380]   or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.580]   That's 1 Corinthians 10, 31.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.220]   That's the bottom line.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.220]   Will God be more glorious to you, to you?
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.420]   And will He look more glorious through you
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.340]   because of this bonus and what you do with it?
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.460]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.740]   And thank you, Wesley, for the question.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.020]   I hope you find this episode helpful
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.780]   as you seek to honor Christ at work.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.340]   And even asking this question, I think,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.740]   says a lot about your character.

[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.460]   Well, on the other side of the weekend,
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.360]   we're gonna go creedal for a moment.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.620]   The Nicene Creed from the fourth century
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.340]   tells us that Jesus was, quote, "begotten, not made."
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.500]   So why is that important, that He was begotten and not made?
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.740]   And what's on the line if we mess this up?
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.980]   Important conversation to have,
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.540]   and we will have it on Monday.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.380]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.200]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.500]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:36.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
