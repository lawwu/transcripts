[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300]   I should like to call your attention once more to the words which are to be found in
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:13.900]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter, verses 11 to 14, reading verses 11
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:21.620]   to 14 in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in whom also we have obtained
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.060]   an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:35.060]   after the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his glory who trusted
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.180]   in Christ, in whom he also trusted, after that he heard the word of truth, the gospel
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.580]   of your salvation, in whom also, after that he believed, ye were sealed with that Holy
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.980]   Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.740]   purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:11.220]   Now we are continuing our discussion of this great statement, our study of this amazing
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.260]   introduction to this epistle to the Ephesians. The apostle has announced that the great secret
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.620]   which God has revealed concerning his purpose is that in this present age and in Christ
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:40.900]   he is reuniting the discordant parts, the separate parts, into which sin has divided
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:49.460]   the world and indeed the whole cosmos. God is restoring the original harmony in heaven
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.980]   and on earth everywhere, and he is doing it in and through our Lord and Saviour Jesus
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.500]   Christ. In the dispensation of the fullness of times, it is his purpose that he might
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.620]   gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.780]   earth, even in him. And now in these verses we are looking at, we are considering the
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.460]   way in which God is doing it. And the great message here is that the first way in which
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.660]   we can see this, and indeed in many senses the greatest part of this, is that which is
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.660]   to be seen in the Christian church.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.540]   As the result of sin the world had been divided into various nations, and God had started
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.980]   his purpose by calling a man called Abraham and turning him into a nation and dealing
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.020]   with that nation in a very special way. So the world was divided into those who were
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.020]   Jews and those who were not Jews, and there was a middle wall of partition between them.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.700]   The first astounding thing that God is doing in Christ, says the apostle, is to abolish
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:08.740]   that middle wall of distinction and to make of twain Jew and non-Jew, one new man, so
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.780]   making peace. There is nothing more marvelous than this as we saw last Sunday morning. Paul
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.420]   never got over the fact that he of all men had been called to be the apostle to the Gentiles.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.860]   He who had been such a rigid and such a narrow nationalistic Jew, he has been delivered from
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.740]   all that. There is no longer Jew nor Gentile. That is a distinction that has gone. He has
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.520]   this new thing, the church, and all who are related to God are related in Christ, in the
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.740]   church, and they are both one together. And he puts it in this particularly interesting
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:55.180]   way, you remember. He puts it in terms of having an inheritance, in whom also we have
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.620]   obtained an inheritance, or we have been made inheritors, or the inheritance has, as it
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.260]   were, been made over to us. And the same thing has happened to the Gentiles, so that we are
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.780]   fellow heirs together. That is the thing the apostle tells us in the third verse of this
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.420]   third chapter that had been specially made clear to him, that the Gentiles, it is the
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.860]   sixth verse of the third chapter, that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:38.620]   same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel. Here is the new Israel.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.740]   Here is the spiritual Israel. Here is the true seed of Abraham, consisting of Jews and
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.740]   Gentiles, with the division having gone forever, and this marvellous harmony and unity thus
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.420]   established and restored.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.860]   Well now, we say that here in these verses the apostle is working that out and showing
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.380]   us how this is coming to pass. And of course, in doing that, he does give us an extraordinary
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.580]   description of the Christian. The unity is established, I say, by making these different
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.660]   people Christians. Whether they are Jews or Gentiles, in Christ, as Christians, they are
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.300]   brought into this new relationship, and here is this marvellous joint inheritance awaiting
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.300]   us.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.180]   So, I say, he incidentally tells us a number of things about the Christian. We have considered
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.460]   two of them. The first thing that makes us Christians is that we are in Christ. And the
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.400]   second thing is that because we are in Christ, we are indeed partakers of this inheritance.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.700]   We are heirs, and fellow heirs, and joint heirs with Christ. And as we saw at the end
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.580]   last Sunday morning, we are therefore looking forward to an inheritance which is incorruptible
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.700]   and undefiled, and that fadeth not away. And even here, in this world, we have had the
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:14.460]   firstfruits. We have had a foretaste. That is the teaching here, as we will find later
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:23.360]   on, as it is the apostles' teaching elsewhere. We ourselves have had the taste, the foretaste,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:31.500]   and we know something of this firstfruits. The great inheritance, as it were, remains,
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.100]   but we are given sufficient of it in this life and in this world to whet our appetites,
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:44.560]   to encourage us to go on, and to fill us with a joy and sense of glory as we anticipate
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   the fullness.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.100]   Now then, we have looked at all that very hurriedly, but this morning we come on to
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:07:00.300]   the next matter, which is the way in which all this has happened to us. Now, you see,
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:07.060]   the astounding thing about us who are Christians is that we are in that position. We are in
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:16.260]   Christ, and we are going on to that amazing inheritance that baffles our very imaginations
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.860]   leave alone our understandings. We shall judge angels, we shall judge the world, we shall
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:31.140]   see Christ face to face, we shall see God. That is what we are going to. Those of us
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:36.380]   who are here this morning, here in this world of time, Christian people, that is what we
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.380]   are.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:45.180]   Now, the question arises, what has brought us to this? How is it that this has ever become
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:54.860]   true of us, knowing ourselves as we do? How does anyone become a Christian? How does anyone
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:02.380]   enter into this position in which he is in Christ, and a jointer with Christ? Well, here,
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:09.020]   as I pointed out last Sunday morning, the apostle deals with that subject also. He is
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.420]   not content with just saying that this is true of us; he tells us how it has become
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.420]   true. And he does that, of course, because, again, this was something at which he never
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:27.740]   ceased to wonder. He never ceased to be surprised at it. So he tells us how it has happened.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:33.340]   And that is the thing to which I want to call your attention this morning. Now, you notice
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:41.540]   that as he does this, he uses a number of terms which we have already encountered, in
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:48.620]   a sense, in dealing with this chapter. We have met them in verses 4 and 5. They are
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.980]   some of those great terms and phrases which are to be found scattered throughout the New
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:09:02.100]   Testament. They are terms which are obviously of the very greatest importance, and terms
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:08.580]   which seem to me to be absolutely essential to a true and ultimate understanding of the
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:19.540]   gospel, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:28.540]   of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his own will. There they are,
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:34.100]   these tremendous terms. I say we have already had them, listened to them, in verses 4 and
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:39.580]   5, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:45.340]   be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:54.660]   of children by Jesus Christ unto himself. Now, there are the terms. Clearly, we are
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:02.700]   here face to face with high doctrine, with some of the great profundities of the Christian
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:09.660]   faith and of the Christian message. Why does the apostle, someone may ask, repeat these
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:15.140]   terms here, having already used them in verses 4 and 5? Well, it seems to me the explanation
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:22.420]   is not only simple, but very important. In verses 4 and 5, the apostle was taking a general
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:30.100]   view of God's purpose. He was looking at it, as it were, from that eternal standpoint.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:38.740]   He was looking at it in general, God's purpose of grace in general. Here now, he is not merely
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:46.620]   looking at it in general. He is looking at it in its particular application to us. There,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.940]   it was the great scheme itself. Here, it is the scheme as applied to us, and still he
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:58.620]   uses the same terms here as he used even there. The terms apply not only to the thought, but
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:05.180]   to the application. And it is, I say, very vital and important that we should understand
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:11.940]   it. Now, as we approach this great matter, nothing
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:19.700]   is more important than that we should do so in the right way and in the right spirit.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:25.340]   There are large numbers of Christian people who never consider terms like these. They
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.900]   never work through these great terms which are to be found in these first fourteen verses
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:37.220]   of this epistle to the Ephesians. Let me just prove that contention by asking you a question.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:44.580]   How often have you heard anybody going slowly and term by term through this great chapter,
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:51.620]   or how often have you read anybody doing so? Isn't there a danger of our avoiding these
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:58.740]   great terms because of certain associations? It seems to me this is something of which
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:06.020]   we as Christian people need to be very wary at this present hour. There are certain aspects
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:13.500]   of New Testament truth which are just not being considered at all because there is an
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.540]   element of controversy attached to them. Now, I am saying that regularly, Friday by Friday,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.380]   in this pulpit. There are large numbers of Christian people who are totally ignorant
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.540]   of prophetic truth because their attitude is, "I can't be bothered with it." It
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.180]   leads to all that arguing and wrangling and those theories and those monstrous theories
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:39.500]   sometimes and people say, "Well, I am afraid I can't be bothered. I don't understand."
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.700]   And they imagine that that is a very wise and sound position to take up. But what they
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:52.860]   are actually doing is this. They are deliberately ignoring God's Word. They are deliberately
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:13:00.420]   bypassing certain aspects and elements of God's revealed truth. Everything in this
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:06.300]   book God means is to study and to face whether it is difficult or simple, whether it is involved
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:12.580]   in controversy or whether it isn't. To say, "Peace at any price at the expense of God's
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:20.060]   revealed truth," is surely an insult to God. These matters have to be faced, whether
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:25.420]   it be the truth concerning prophecy or whether it be the truth concerning these high matters
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.820]   of doctrine which the apostle puts before us here in these verses as he has already
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.220]   done in verses 4 and 5.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:42.780]   Very well, I say, we approach the truth in this way. First of all, without prejudice.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:48.460]   We all start with prejudices. We take up positions. And having taken them up, we argue for them
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.580]   and we defend them. "I have always said this. Perhaps my parents said it before me
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:59.060]   or somebody else, and therefore I stand." No, it often happens that we really have never
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.220]   considered the Scriptures concerning these matters. We have never read a book on the
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.380]   subject. We have never considered what those whom God has called and appointed as leaders
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.540]   in the Church throughout the centuries have said and have taught. No, no, we just start
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.500]   with a prejudice. And we hold on to this and we feel it is a part of our very personality
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:23.340]   and we must defend it. Our minds are shut and closed. We don't even consider it.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:30.220]   I needn't waste your time in pointing out to you what a totally unchristian attitude
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:35.820]   that is. There is nothing which is further removed from the Christian position than that.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:41.580]   That was the attitude of the Pharisees. It was because of that they hated our Lord. What's
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.580]   this new idea? It was the thing that confronted the apostles wherever they went to preach.
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:54.740]   This new theory, this new idea, the prejudice. Oh, may God give us grace to rid ourselves
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:00.780]   of our prejudices to which we are all liable and to which we are all subject as the result
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.140]   of sin.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:09.460]   The second thing I would say that is of importance is this, that we must submit ourselves and
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:17.880]   our minds entirely to the Scripture. What I mean by that is this, that I must make a
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.420]   positive effort of the mind to come to the Scripture as if I knew nothing. That I allow
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.220]   the Scripture to speak to me instead of my reading my thoughts into the Scripture. It
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:35.900]   is a very difficult thing to do. It is difficult for all of us. We all have these preconceived
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:42.740]   notions and we tend to put on these spectacles, and we see the Scripture through the spectacles.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.420]   We must submit ourselves to the Scriptures. I put that in a negative form by putting it
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:55.740]   like this. We must not come to these matters in terms of philosophy.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:03.020]   Now I mean this, of course, that we all tend to start with our ideas as to what God should
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:08.740]   do and what is right for God to do and that if God does not do that, well, then we do
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.660]   not quite see that it is fair. You know the sort of thing that the Apostle puts into the
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:19.300]   mouth of an objector in that ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans that we read
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.100]   just now, a man who says, "Well, now, if that is so, well, then is God being fair?
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:30.300]   Is God being fair?" That is philosophy. That is a philosopher pitting his mind against
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:36.420]   God's revelation. And it is the most dangerous thing we can do. It is because they do that
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:41.940]   that so many people are not Christians today. They say, "I cannot understand this idea
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:47.620]   of the incarnation, two natures in one person," so they reject it. You see, they do not understand
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:54.060]   it. That is philosophy. They do not understand the Atonement, one dying for—no, no, they
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:59.780]   cannot. You see, they are thinking philosophically. Most people who reject the Gospel of salvation
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:08.180]   do so simply because they say, "I cannot understand." They are not technical philosophers,
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:13.740]   but they are speaking philosophically. Well, I say it is of vital importance, if we are
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:22.860]   to submit our minds to the Scripture and their revelation, that we cease to think philosophically.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.860]   In other words, we must realize that we are face to face with something here that we cannot
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:34.500]   understand. I will go further. Something that we are not meant to understand. You notice
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:40.100]   how the Apostle deals with this position. The man puts up his objection, and the Apostle
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.300]   simply replies by saying, "I am not going to argue with you about this, but who art
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:55.180]   thou, O man? Who art thou that pittest thyself against God?" This is not to be understood,
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:01.660]   says Paul. This is to be received. This is what God himself has told us. And if you think
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:08.980]   that you can understand and span, ultimately, the mind of the Lord, well, you are just saying
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:14.340]   that your whole idea of God is wrong. That is the trouble. It is your thinking of God
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:20.420]   that is wrong. Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counselor?
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:27.180]   That is the question asked by Isaiah and quoted constantly in the New Testament. My dear friends,
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.180]   we are face to face with something here which is the mystery of God's eternal mind, and
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.540]   it is so high above us that we should not even begin to try to understand it. We just
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:45.060]   humbly come to it and look at it and receive it. If you, therefore, try to have a final
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.540]   understanding of these matters, or to be able to reconcile certain things intellectually,
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:57.220]   you are not only doomed to failure, but you are guilty of trying to do something that
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:04.220]   the apostle rebukes in the strongest and clearest manner in that ninth chapter of the Epistle
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.540]   to the Romans. And if you want his further rebukes, read the second chapter of the first
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:16.500]   Epistle to the Corinthians. The natural mind understandeth not the things of the Spirit
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:23.180]   of God. He cannot do so. Very well, then. Let us, I say, take these great matters in
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:30.500]   that way. It is a truth, obviously, for Christian people only. It is not a truth to be preached
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:37.380]   in an evangelistic service. It is a truth for the children. It is a truth for those
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.700]   who have been let into the secret. It is a truth for those who have been given the Holy
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:49.220]   Spirit, who enlightens the mind and who gives understanding, not for the natural man who
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:56.300]   does not understand any part of salvation, and least of all this. So, I say, it is a
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:02.620]   truth for the children. And I would add, it is a truth which the children of God throughout
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:07.960]   the centuries, as I think I reminded you of by many quotations when we were dealing with
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.820]   verses four and five, it is a truth which the children of God have always found to be
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:22.580]   the most consoling of all, the most encouraging, and the most reassuring. Very well, what is
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:30.220]   it? Well, now then, let us start by putting it like this. The controlling thought in these
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:40.860]   matters is always the glory of God. Listen to it again. "That we should be to the praise
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:47.620]   of his glory who first trusted in Christ." Again, "Which is the earnest of our inheritance
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:54.700]   until the redemption of the purchased possession, and to the praise of his glory." You remember
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.660]   the whole paragraph started with these words, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:06.300]   Jesus Christ." You start there, you end there, "The glory of God." It was there again in
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:13.820]   the sixth verse, "To the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:28.420]   in the beloved." I therefore suggest that the ultimate test of every view of salvation
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:36.940]   is this test of the glory of God. If you want to know whether your view of salvation is
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:45.780]   truly scriptural, test it by that test. Does it give all the glory to God, or is just a
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:53.020]   little reserved for you, or for me, or for somebody else? That is the test. You notice
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.300]   here the Apostle keeps on repeating it, "To the glory of God, the glory of his grace,
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:05.700]   to his glory." It is all God's glory. "Him that glorieth," says the Apostle, "let him
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:13.900]   glory in the Lord. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom,
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:22.220]   righteousness, sanctification, redemption. According as it is written, "He that glorieth,
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:28.780]   let him glory in the Lord." Now then, whatever view I may take of the way in which I have
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:37.220]   become a Christian, the test is, does it promote and minister to the glory of God?
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:47.500]   Now that is the Apostle's teaching here clearly. It is nothing in us. Salvation comes
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:56.640]   to us in spite of ourselves. We are nothing. We are not Christians because of our particular
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:04.300]   character or because of something that we have done. No, no. It is all of God. It is
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:09.220]   the Apostle's great theme, you remember, in the second chapter where he puts it like this,
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:15.740]   "For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves." It is the gift
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:22.620]   of God, not of works. "Lest any man should boast." There is to be no glory. No man
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:31.140]   must glory in himself. "Lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:37.340]   in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:43.940]   them." Now that, you see, is his meaning here. He elaborates it there in the second
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:48.300]   chapter. As I told you last Sunday, this is a sort of overture. He just hints at the theme
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:55.620]   and there he works it out in greater detail. But of course it is not confined to this epistle
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:03.300]   to the Ephesians. It is to be found everywhere. It runs as a great theme right through the
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:12.380]   New Testament, perhaps most clearly of all in the Gospel of John. This particular aspect
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:19.180]   of truth is certainly to be found most clearly on the lips of our blessed Lord and Saviour
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:25.980]   himself. Read the sixth chapter of John's Gospel. Read the tenth chapter. Then read
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.940]   the high priestly prayer in the seventeenth chapter. And there it is in its glory and
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:37.940]   in its fullness. It is the great doctrine, I say, running right through the New Testament.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.660]   But it is equally true to say of it that it is the great doctrine of the Old Testament
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.860]   also.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:54.540]   Why was Israel the chosen race? Why were the Jews the chosen people? Now the Old Testament
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:02.180]   itself answers that question constantly. It was not because of anything in them. Indeed,
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.620]   someone once put it, and I think there was a great deal of justification for his saying
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.380]   it like this, that God seemed to have chosen them in order to show that if he could do
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:16.940]   that with people like that, he could do it with anybody. Not because they were better
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:24.100]   than others. Look at their story. Read your Old Testament history. They constantly wander
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.340]   away. Well, the whole thing is of God, and God says so. He says it specifically to them.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.340]   He says, "Don't think that I've chosen you because there was anything in you. I've
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:39.180]   done it for my own namesake. I've done it that my glory might be manifested." The
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:47.420]   whole thing in the Old Testament, from the call of Abram onwards, is of God. It's there
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:53.140]   in the old. It's here in the new. "You only have I known of all the nations of the
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.260]   earth," he says through the prophet Amos, and so on.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:06.660]   Well, very well. There is the overall aspect of the truth, the glory of God, that it's
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:11.540]   all of God. But Paul breaks it up into its component parts, and let me just note them
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:25.300]   to you. The first thing he tells us is this, that God has purposed all this, in whom also
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:33.380]   we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him. Now, it is
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:41.740]   God's, I say, in this respect, that the original idea, the thought, the whole purpose,
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:53.660]   in its very inception, was something that originated with God. The eternal God evolved
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:27:04.020]   this purpose of restoring this unity, this harmony, and of doing so in terms of certain
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:15.060]   people before the foundation of the world. That is the great purpose which God has conceived,
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:23.340]   and it is his purpose. It starts with him. It originates with him. But you notice the
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.380]   apostle is not content with leaving it at that. He adds something to that by putting
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:37.500]   it like this, "according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:45.780]   of his own will." Now, that's a most important phrase. "The counsel of his own will."
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:52.860]   It means this. That is added, it seems to me, to safeguard the previous idea that the
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:28:02.220]   purpose is entirely and only God's. That's why the apostle has said this before to us.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.060]   He said it in verse 5, "having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:14.500]   Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will." It's again in verse 9, "having
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:19.860]   made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:28.620]   in himself." Now, you notice that he goes on saying that. Why? Well, for this reason.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:36.080]   It is his way of saying that this purpose which God has conceived was not suggested
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:43.300]   to God by anybody else. You see, there again I quote that great statement in the 40th chapter
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:49.820]   of Isaiah, "Who hath been God's counsellor? Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:58.760]   hath been his counsellor?" Now, this is Paul's way of saying that very thing. It
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:05.220]   is all according to the counsel of God's own will. Nobody came forward, as it were,
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:10.660]   and suggested to God, "Now, wouldn't it be a good thing, perhaps, to do this or that?"
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:19.980]   Not at all. Not only that, it was not only not suggested to him by anybody else, it was
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:27.980]   not even suggested to God by anything in anybody else. Now, that's an important statement
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:35.420]   in this way. There are those who say that God has done all this and conceived this great
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:42.300]   purpose simply because of his full knowledge, and because he saw that certain people were
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.940]   going to do certain things, and that having seen that these people were going to be different
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.140]   from others, and therefore better than others, because they were going to do these certain
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:57.820]   things, that God found a kind of suggestion in that, and having got that suggestion, he
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:04.820]   then decided to do certain things. That's a complete denial of what the Apostle teaches
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:16.780]   here. It is according to the counsel of his own will. It is absolutely and entirely in
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:27.100]   God. He thought with himself. If I may put it with reverence, he deliberated and meditated
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:33.900]   with himself. The counsel of his own will, the whole purpose of salvation from beginning
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:44.220]   to end, is exclusively in God, with nothing coming from the outside anywhere at all. The
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:52.300]   purpose, according to the counsel of his own will, no suggestion, no hint, no something
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:58.140]   happening to which God reacts, not at all. Everything begins in God. Everything originates
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:04.980]   in God. Everything comes out of God. The counsel of his own will. You see, he repeats it. It
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:10.220]   is not only God's purpose. It is God's purpose according to the counsel of his own
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:19.300]   will, uninfluenced by anything or anyone, anywhere.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:25.840]   I said at the beginning that we were considering high doctrine. I know of nothing more wonderful
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:32.620]   or more glorious than this, that God should have been pleased to reveal these things to
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:40.140]   us through his servant, indeed through his servants, through the book everywhere. Because,
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:45.820]   you see, this has a personal application to you and to me. We are not considering some
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:52.620]   abstract truth this morning. My friends, it goes on to say this. There, before time, before
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:58.220]   the creation of the world, God purposed all this according to the counsel of his own will.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:07.140]   Yes, he is going to restore this wonderful harmony, and in particular, he has purposed
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:13.580]   that you and I should have a part in it, and have a place in it. Listen to this. "In
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:20.860]   whom also we have obtained an inheritance." Well, how will we come into it? Here is the
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:28.660]   answer. "Being predestinated according to the purpose which he purposed according to
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:39.060]   the counsel of his own will." Now then, it means this. You and I are sharing in this.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:49.780]   You and I have tasted of the heavenly gift. You and I know something about the firstfruits
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:56.780]   and the foretaste of everlasting bliss and glory. You and I are what we are this morning
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:05.260]   for this reason, that God purposed, according to the counsel of his own will, that you and
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:14.380]   I should be in it and should be sharers of it. "Being predestinated." Predestinated
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:23.780]   means predetermined. Predetermined, nothing less than that. What it means, therefore,
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:30.500]   I say, is this. And if you can tell me of anything greater or more staggering than this,
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:43.820]   I'd like to know what it is. God thought of me. He thought of you. There in that eternal
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:52.540]   counsel of his own will. He didn't merely conceive the plan. He saw you in it. We, says
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:59.900]   Paul, we Jews who first trusted in Christ, you also who have got a part of this inheritance,
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:05.540]   God has predetermined that we should be in it. We are in it because he predetermined
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:18.380]   it. "Being predestinated." We are not only in the mind and in the heart of God now.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:26.820]   We were always there. And we are there now because we were there before. It is God who
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:32.580]   works this out, as I'm going to show you right through. But this, I say, is the most
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.700]   amazing thing and the most concerning and comforting thing. It's the whole basis of
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:42.020]   my assurance at this moment. It's the guarantee of my future. It's God who's put me where
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:49.780]   I am. "And he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:58.500]   Christ." Predetermined it. And I'm in it. And I am what I am in spite of my sin, in
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:05.700]   spite of all that is so true of me, in spite of the fact that I was with others dead in
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:14.220]   trespasses and sins, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:20.620]   after the counsel of his own will. But listen to the next step. You see it, don't you?
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:30.580]   The purpose conceived entirely and exclusively in God. Particular reference to you, to me,
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:37.700]   to others. Fullness of the Gentiles, fullness of the Jews. That's the great kingdom. There
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:43.100]   are the people, the family of God, gathered in that way, being gathered throughout the
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:49.500]   centuries. There's the plan. Now then, how does this thing actually come into being?
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.100]   How does it actually come to me and to you? How has this great purpose really begun to
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:36:01.480]   operate? Then he uses this word, the word "worketh," in whom also we have obtained
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:09.820]   an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:16.820]   according to the counsel of his own will. Now what does this mean? Well, this is the
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:25.580]   apostle's way of saying that God is not only entirely responsible for the initiation
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:33.620]   and the conception and the thought of the purpose, he is equally responsible for its
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:42.140]   carrying out, its being carried out, its efficiency, its being worked out. Now this is tremendous,
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:50.340]   startling, but it is of the very essence of the whole teaching of the Bible. It is indeed
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:37:01.660]   the whole story of the Bible. You remember when men fell, God at once revealed his purpose.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.860]   Man has been a fool, he's listened to the devil, he's sinned, he's fallen, he's
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:11.260]   gone down and dragged the whole of humanity down with him, and the earth has been cursed,
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:19.780]   and the whole harmony of God's cosmos has been reduced to chaos. And God announced
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:26.860]   his plan, his purpose, the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head. That's
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:34.020]   the announcement. Well, then you go on reading your Old Testament, and you'll see God working
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:42.140]   it out, worketh, who worketh all things. Yes, says Paul, in that second chapter, I've
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:47.700]   already quoted it to you, we are his workmanship. He's the worker, the operator, the one who
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:54.060]   does it all, puts it into execution even. Not of us, not of works, lest any man should
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:38:02.980]   boast. Well, you go on with the history, I say. You see him bringing the flood to pass,
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:10.940]   and saving but a remnant, just one family, eight souls, Noah and his family, all God's
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:18.860]   work. They didn't understand, he told them, he made them do it, he put them into the ark.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.220]   And then you go on and you come along to the call of Abram. What's all this? Well, it's
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:28.580]   a part of the working out of God's great purpose. You see, he was preparing for the
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:33.260]   coming of his son, the Messiah, in whom the thing was finally to be done. But the preparation
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:38.300]   was necessary, and the preparation is entirely the work of God. He looks at a man called
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:46.460]   Abram in a pagan surrounding, and he calls him out, God working, he worketh it out, he
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:53.740]   is working out the plan. And you remember that he turned that man into a nation, and
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:39:03.180]   you follow out the history, the giving of the law, the types, the sacrifices. Not only
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.500]   is he working it out, but he's showing how he's going to work it out finally. The people
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:14.660]   go wrong and astray, he delivers them out of Egypt, and again they go astray, and he
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.220]   sends them prophets to warn them that they're carried away into captivity, he brings them
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:25.380]   back. If there's anybody present who can read the Old Testament and say that the Jews
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.580]   were what they were because of themselves, well, I frankly confess I don't understand
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:36.820]   your mentality. The plan of God would have founded at the very beginning if it were not
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:43.700]   God who works it out himself, in spite of his own people. He worked it, and he went
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:51.860]   on working it, amazing them and surprising them and astounding them. And when the fullness
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:58.500]   of the times had come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law that
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:05.460]   he might redeem them that are under the law, that we might have the adoption of children.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:10.900]   And there he works it out in the Son, God the Son is here working out the salvation,
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:18.460]   obeying the law, giving manifestations of his glory, bearing the sins of his own in
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:27.020]   his own body on the tree, making the atonement, it's all of God. Rising from the grave,
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:33.580]   ascending, sending down the Holy Spirit. You see, it's all God's work, it's God
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:39.900]   working it out, working out his own purpose, who worketh all things according to the counsel
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:49.540]   of his own will, and still more wonderful. He works it out in us as well. Were it not
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:56.620]   for that, my dear friend, we, none of us would be Christians this morning. He quickens us,
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.580]   he convicts us, and so on. Well, the apostle, I say, is full of this doctrine everywhere.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:06.460]   We are his workmanship. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. How can
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:14.700]   you do so? It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.780]   It is God who has given us the Spirit that searcheth all things, yea, the deep things
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.860]   of God. Otherwise, we wouldn't understand these things at all. The whole thing from
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:29.440]   beginning to end is a part of God's great scheme and purpose. But listen to Paul putting
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:36.180]   it still more plainly, perhaps in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, starting
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.820]   at verse twenty-eight, "We know that all things work together for good to them that
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:48.540]   love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose." You see the same terms?
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:57.080]   Purpose, called, worketh. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.460]   to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren. Moreover,
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:09.140]   whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called them, he also justified;
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:24.540]   and whom he justified them, he also glorified. It is God who worketh it all, from beginning
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:32.180]   to the very end. Now that's not the end of the story. That is only the beginning, the
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.100]   point at which we have to leave it for this morning.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:48.780]   The question, I say, we've been looking at is this. Why am I what I am as a Christian?
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:57.740]   What accounts for the fact that I'm here, that we are all here, and not out in the world
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:06.540]   and living that worldly life, as so many others? What is it? That's the question. And the
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:13.700]   first answer is, well, it's nothing in us. It's not that we are different or better.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:20.500]   Nothing to do with it. We are no better than the world, than Jacob was better than Esau.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:26.220]   Indeed, where I put to it, I think I could prove that the reverse was the case, that
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:33.060]   as a natural man, Esau was a much better and nicer and finer type than Jacob. No, no, it's
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:45.820]   nothing in us at all. It's God's purpose, according to the counsel of his own will.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:56.300]   It's what he's predestined, predetermined. It is what he himself has worked out. Yes,
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.980]   but God willing, next Sunday morning we will consider the means which God uses in order
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:13.460]   to do this, the way in which God does work it out, and what he asks of you and of me
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:21.380]   in the working out of his own great and glorious purpose. It's all here, but we've started
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:30.900]   as we must start with this, because the thing that must ever be most prominent is the glory
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:47.720]   of God, that we might be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. Amen.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.820]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
