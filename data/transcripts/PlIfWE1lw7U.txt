[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, who is Jesus?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   It is a perennial question, and there must be as many diverse answers to that question as there are about any other person who ever walked on this planet.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Even during his life on earth, Christ's very presence was a point of remarkable debate and contention.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Some said Jesus was God, and others said he was demon-possessed.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Some said Jesus was a good teacher, and others called him a liar.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Some said he was brilliant, and others labeled him insane.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Jesus was applauded as a prophet, and he was dismissed as a babbling blasphemer.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So who is this Jesus?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   In the words of Hebrews 1, verse 3, we are told that Jesus is "the radiance of the glory of God, and the exact imprint of his nature."
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   In a 1996 sermon, John Piper answered this age-old question, "Who is Jesus?"
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Who is it that sat down at the right hand?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Who is it that went to the cross?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Who is it that was buried and rose again?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Who is it that upholds all things by the word of his power?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Who is Jesus Christ?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   He is the exact representation of the divine nature, or of God's nature.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   What does that mean?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Jesus said, "If you've seen me, you've seen the Father."
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Paul said, "He is the image of the invisible God."
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   But you know what?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You could say that sentence, "He is the exact representation of the nature of God,"
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and be absolutely wrong in the way you think about it.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   For example, you could say, "Jesus is the representation of God the Father,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   the way a painting represents a person."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And you'd be wrong.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You could say, "Jesus represents the nature of God
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   the way an authorized letter from a king represents the king."
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And you'd be wrong.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Or you could say, "Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   is the exact representation of God the Father in that a wax mold has an impress,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and it perfectly represents the ring."
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And you'd be wrong.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And the reason we know that would be utterly inadequate to talk that way
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   is because the first phrase tells us how he is a representation,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and it isn't any of those.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He is an exact representation of the Father in that he is the radiance of his glory.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   He represents the glory of God the way radiance represents glory.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   That's very different than a painting representing a person,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   a letter, a king, a wax mold, and a ring.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Radiance coming out from a light, streaming down from the sun,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   is not another thing.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's not a different essence than the thing.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The radiance of glory is the glory radiating.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   That's the profound thing to get a handle on here.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Christ is not other than God, representing God.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   He is God representing God.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He is the Father streaming out in glory,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   standing forth in another person whose essence is the same divine essence.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   We're talking mystery here, I realize.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   We won't begin to exhaust this or end it, but we can see a little bit.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   The window can be cracked enough so that we can worship aright
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and not make heretical statements about the sun being a creature or a mere prophet.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   There is no time, let's compare him with the sun, the sun radiating out its beams.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   There is no time when the sun exists that its radiant light does not exist.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   They are so much a part of each other that when the sun exists, the radiance of the sun exists.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   When God the Father exists, the sun exists.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   They are co-eternal.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   The Father did not exist and they say, "I think I shall bring into being a sun."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That is not the way it happened.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   He is eternally begotten, eternally streaming out.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Where there is light, there are rays.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Where there is God, there is the Son of God.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   This radiance is the glory radiating out.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It is not essentially different.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   The Son of God is God.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   He is not by nature another being.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   He is not created or made.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Compare this with a solar calculator.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I think of this because I was using one the other night getting my tech stuff ready.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I asked Barnabas, "Where is the off switch here?"
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I was pushing the on switch.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   He said, "It is a solar calculator."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I said, "Oh, just put it back in the cover. It goes off."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   What that means is that when the sun or the light in my dining room shines on this little window,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   a little black number appears.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It would be fair to say that the light created that or made it, produced it in some way.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And that number is not the light.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   So don't ever think of the Son of God like the numbers on a solar calculator.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   That God made the sun.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   He brought the sun into being like that.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   The sun is the light shining on the world and making the world.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   He is begotten, not made, the old creeds say.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The point being that you beget light.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Humans beget humans, dogs beget puppies, cats beget kittens, and God begets God.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Lastly, it is by means of the rays of the light that we see light.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   In the first service at this point, the sun came out and a big beam just landed on about 40 people right there.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It was unbelievable.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It was great.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I said, "Now, you know what?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   If you try to look up through that window in the sun, first of all, it will blind you.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Don't do that."
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And that's just a little reflection of God.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   God would blind you too.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   You have to have a means to see God.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   You have to have a mediator.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   The mediator is the Son of God and the Son of God is the radiance of the glory of God.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And I said, "You know what?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   The light that is on your face right now arrived there eight minutes after it left the sun.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   About eight minutes ago while I was preaching, it left the sun.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   These beams went out and they landed right on our face.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Now, if you look at those rays, you can actually see, if you put on the right glasses, you see a ball.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Or at sunrise and sundown when it's safe, you can see a ball.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Are you seeing the sun?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Yeah, you're seeing the sun.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   But actually you're seeing eight minutes later what the means of the sun's rays give to you to see.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Right?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We're together.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   This is the 20th century.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   What we're seeing is a ball that's eight minutes old being mediated to us by light streaming over 93 million miles from the sun.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   But we're seeing the sun, folks.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   That's the sun.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And when you look at Jesus Christ, you are seeing God.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That is so good.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   This clip was pulled from John Piper's sermon preached on April 7th, 1996, entitled "He Sat Down at the Right Hand of Majesty."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   This clip was sent in by Jacob Hall.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Thank you, Jacob, for this clip.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   The entire sermon can be found at DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And if you have a great sermon clip, send it in to us via e-mail.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Send us clips, even your own personal questions.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   We want those.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn and there you will find a little button to e-mail your question or your clip to us.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So, Jesus is the radiance of God.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   You can't ignore him.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And he is still dividing opinions and dividing people to this day.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So how do we as Christians humbly wield the offense of the cross among multi-religious and pluralistic societies like those that we live in today?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   It's a question from a listener in Singapore, and I will pose it to John Piper tomorrow.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
