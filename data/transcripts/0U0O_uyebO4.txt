[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   A podcast listener named Kent writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I have a question
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.340]   about word choice in your motto, 'God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.340]   in Him.'
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.080]   I know you've thought and prayed extensively about each word to convey the proper message,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.040]   but I'm wondering why you didn't choose the word 'Christ' in place of 'God'
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.440]   or 'Him.'
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.440]   What I like most about your ministry is that Christ is central to everything you preach
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.900]   and there's no confusing the God you glorify with any other God of this world.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.280]   But without using 'Christ,' the above phrase loses specificity and could be referring to
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.920]   a Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, or other God.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.000]   Why not include 'Christ' in the motto?"
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.680]   Well, I am always happy and eager to clarify the meaning of my favorite slogan, "God
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.720]   is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him."
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.360]   So let me make four very brief comments and congratulate Kent.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.000]   I mean, I just totally agree with what he's saying and maybe this will give him perspective
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.680]   on how I think.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.880]   Number one, I very often in speaking do use the name Christ and I often say, "Christ
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.280]   is most magnified in us when we are most satisfied in Him."
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.440]   And I do this because of Philippians 1, 20 and 21, where Paul says his eager expectation
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.640]   and hope is that Christ would be magnified in his body, whether by life or death, for
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.000]   to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.080]   And I argue from the very structure of that text that fundamental to my Christian hedonism
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:48.400]   is that Christ and His magnificence is shown by Paul's counting Him an all-satisfying
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   gain when he loses everything and dies.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.120]   So yes, yes, yes, at the very root of my slogan is a text that makes Christ the center of
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   it.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.360]   Number two, when I say God, I have in mind the Trinitarian God usually when I say that.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.680]   Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.680]   So I don't mean to say God instead of Christ when I say God is most glorified in us.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.720]   Number three, often, this is maybe the most unusual point, often in the New Testament
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.800]   the word God is used as shorthand for God the Father, and there is a certain priority
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.400]   given to the Father in relation to the Son which might warrant the prominence of the
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.120]   word God in the slogan.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.200]   And here's what I'm thinking about, Philippians 2, 9.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.280]   "Therefore God has highly exalted Christ and bestowed on Him the name that is above
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.200]   every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.760]   under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.920]   God the Father."
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.160]   So the exaltation of Jesus over every name is for the glory of God.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.240]   You see the kind of ultimacy or priority given to God the Father in that text.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.800]   Or 1 Corinthians 15, 28.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   "When all things are subjected to Christ, then the Son Himself will be subjected to
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.520]   Him the Father who put all things in subjection under Him that God may be all in all."
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.960]   And it's another kind of prioritization or ultimazize, whatever that word would be, making
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   ultimate of God the Father.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.120]   And one last text on this, Philippians 1, 9-11, this prayer.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:52.360]   "It is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.760]   so that you may approve what is excellent and so be pure and blameless for the day of
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.880]   Christ, filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ to the glory
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   and praise of God."
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.640]   So you see the structure again from chapter 2.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   So it is in a profound sense right for us to think of God the Father as the one for
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.920]   whom Christ has accomplished all His work.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.680]   Not at all minimizing the ultimacy of Christ's glory as the perfect image of the Father's
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   radiance.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.720]   And number four, in common parlance, and this may be the reason why years and years
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.520]   ago I started saying God instead of Christ.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.280]   In common parlance in the world and in the broad church, not necessarily just evangelical,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.960]   the word God sounds more all-encompassing and ultimate than Christ.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.040]   Now rightly understood, that's not true.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.480]   It shouldn't be.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.440]   Jesus is Lord of all.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.040]   But in ordinary public language, if you want to say something that sounds global or universal
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:16.840]   or cutting across all groupings and all religious enclaves, God's statements have that effect
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   more than Christ's statements or Jesus' statements.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.440]   And so it just depends on what's the context, who's your audience, what kind of impact
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.840]   or connotation do you want the statement to have.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.280]   One more point, finally I agree with Kent.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:39.480]   He's right that in our day of religious pluralism, especially the prominence of Islam, the prominence
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.740]   of Christ needs to be highlighted more often than it used to be.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:54.020]   So I think in recent years I have felt exactly what Kent has felt, and I have tried, and
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.920]   perhaps now his question will help me try more, try to be explicit and clear that the
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:09.280]   glory I'm talking about is the glory of Christ as the great expression of the glory of God.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:18.640]   So let's be alert to our audiences, let's give Christ the honor, do his name, and sometimes
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.560]   say God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him, and sometimes clarify
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.840]   explicitly that Christ is most magnified or glorified in us when we are most satisfied
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.080]   in him, just as Paul teaches in Philippians 1.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.640]   Thank you, Pastor John, that's very good.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.460]   And we love talking about this because we love proclaiming Christ as we repeat over
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.800]   and over again, God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him, and we
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.320]   do this every day at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.400]   Visit the site to find decades of our work and thousands of books, articles, sermons,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.000]   and other resources to flesh out this theme, and it's all free of charge to you.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.980]   Well all of us need to change something in life, and many of us want to change something
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.980]   about ourselves.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.720]   So what is the single key to breaking free from life's ruts?
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.000]   The answer is simple, it's profound, and John Piper will explain tomorrow right here on
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.920]   the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.520]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, thanks for listening.
