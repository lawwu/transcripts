[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Quick coaching call version of the show today.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I'll be back soon with the regular format of the show.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I want to talk with you about making decisions
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   and clarifying costs.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   This is just a simple thing that I've noticed,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   very straightforward.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   But I've recognized that many people
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   don't have a framework for making decisions,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   or at least they don't specifically
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   isolate, they don't have a specific process
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   that they could clearly say,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   here's my process, my framework for making decisions.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   So I want to give you a tool that is going to sound
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   incredibly basic to some, but incredibly useful
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   to others of you.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I receive a lot of questions here on the show,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Joshua, should I do this, what would be the option here,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   what would be the, you know, should I make this
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   financial decision, should I do this thing here?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And I often look at the questions and I think,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   but this is so simple.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But obviously it's not simple to the person
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   asking the question.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Otherwise, well, unless they're just interested
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   in my viewpoint, which is probable to some of them,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   but it's not simple to them because they haven't
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   put it down.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And sometimes I respond back with an email
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   and say, well, what about this information,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   this information?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   But it's very simple about just simply weigh
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   the pros and cons and make a list of all of the reasons
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   to make a change and all the reasons to not make a change
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and clarify the costs and clarify the benefits.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   But the key is write it down.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And that's the point that I want to make to you.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Our natural way of making decisions is to think
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   something through and think through the pros
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and the cons, the costs and the benefits.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And then if the benefits outweigh the costs,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   we make the decision.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   If the pros outweigh the cons, we make the decision,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   whichever direction it is.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   But what I've recognized is very few of us
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   are disciplined enough to consistently clarify
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   the key bits of info for each decision
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   that we have to make.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Rather, we let it all swim around in our brain.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And brains are a very bad place for processing
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   some types of information.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   They're great at some things and they're bad at other things.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And one of those things is trying to think your way
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   through a decision.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's a lot easier if you get it out on paper
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   and it's black and white.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   The best way to do this that I use often --
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   excuse me, not the best way, the simplest way
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   that's a good way --
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   comes from a sales closing technique.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   There's a whole business --
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   if you pay any attention to sales training,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   there's an aspect of sales that involves
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   closing techniques.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And professional selling has changed
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   from the way that it used to be done.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   But it used to be that a professional salesperson
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   would spend a little bit of time finding out
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   what you needed, more amount of time
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   presenting to you the solution,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   and then a whole lot of time tying you down
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   with some fancy closing language.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   The best example would be alternative choice.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   "Dear Mr. Jones, you're looking at this furniture.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Well, would you like it in blue or red?"
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   That's a closing technique,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   just presenting an alternative choice.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And most people are savvy enough now
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   to spell that out.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And most of us are not manipulated by,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   "Well, I don't know how to say whether I would like it
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   in something other than blue and red,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   or I wouldn't like it at all."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Most of us are familiar with that.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So, a pro tip for you,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   alternative choice is still powerful,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   but you've got to do it a little bit more elegantly.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So if you're a salesperson,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   still use an alternative choice,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   but be a little smoother about it,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and don't do it too soon,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   and position things a little bit more elegantly,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   rather than just, "Well, would you like it blue or red?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Is Tuesday better, or is Thursday better for you?"
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Be a little bit smoother.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   But that is a closing technique.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And one of the more famous closing techniques
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   that you probably should be aware of
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   is commonly called the Ben Franklin Close.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And every sales seminar that I ever listen to,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   or every sales training,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   they always cover the Ben Franklin Close.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And it's pretty tired because of that fact
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   that most people have used it.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   But here is how the sales close was taught to salespeople.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   You would do a sales presentation.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You'd finish up the sales presentation.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You're sitting, whatever you're selling,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   you're sitting in front of a couple,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   and they're on the fence,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and they can't make up their mind,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   and they haven't committed to the buying decision.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And so you say, "You know, Benjamin Franklin
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   was one of the wisest and most respected men in history.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Wouldn't you agree, Mr. and Mrs. Jones?"
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Got to get in the agreement.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Whenever he was faced with a tough decision,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   much like you are today,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   he would take out a plain piece of paper.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   He would draw a line down the middle
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and put a plus sign on one half
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and a minus sign on the other.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And he discovered that by listing
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   all the positive elements on the plus side of the paper
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and the negative things on the minus side,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   well, the answer would become obvious.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   That makes a lot of sense, wouldn't you agree?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   With your permission,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I'm going to borrow Ben Franklin's method
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   for just a moment.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And since you're having a tough time making a decision,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   let's list the benefits,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   some of the reasons that you should make this purchased,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and then we'll list the negatives.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Fair enough?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And then you write down all the positive qualities
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and benefits of the product or service,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   or if you're a little bit more advanced,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   you have the prospect write them down for you
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   or list them off for you,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and you pay attention to what's the most interesting.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And then you write down the negative prospect
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   and the negative options,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   and of course, as the salesperson,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   you never list any negatives.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   You let the prospect list the negatives.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And what happens is that almost always
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   the negative list will be shorter than the positive.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So that's the sales closing technique.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And it's very effective,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   but the key is to use it professionally,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   and I won't go too deep into that.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But it's good to know.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I love, by the way,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   in case you think I'm making fun of salespeople,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I love being sold to.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's one of my favorite things in the world,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   and I often will buy things
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   just because a salesperson is a great salesperson.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I'm talking about smaller ticket items.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But I love, love, love to be sold to professionally.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But the key is professionally,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   and jumping into a closing technique
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   without all of the earlier steps,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   finding the need, clearly identifying it,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   proposing the solution,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   finding out, making sure it's appropriate,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   all that other stuff.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I hate that.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And most of you do too.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   So even though this is something
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   that generally gets made fun of today,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   makes you think of a not-so-fun selling situation
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   where a salesperson is being unprofessional
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   and pushing you too far,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   still a useful technique.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   That's called the Ben Franklin Close.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Now, my encouragement to you
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   is just to always use this yourself.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Anytime you have a decision to make,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   take out a little notebook.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I like the type of notebook,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   the Moleskine notebook type.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I get some--
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   By the way, a couple times,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   if you like the Moleskine type of notebook,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I've found some good deals on a brand called Ecosystem,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   and they're really nice notebooks.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   So I like that type of notebook.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Open it up where you got a page on the left
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and a page on the right.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Put a plus or a minus,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   or put the two opposing.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   If I move, if I don't move,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   advantages to this job, advantages to that job.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Write it down, and then just fill out the page
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   with everything that you can think of.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And when you do that,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   the answer is going to probably emerge.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Tip to make this work well,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   put everything on the page.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Specifically, list all of the costs.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Where I see this a lot of times
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   would be something like buying cars.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Many times when people are trying
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   to make a car buying decision,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I faced this recently.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I was making a car buying decision.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   You get excited about the acquisition.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's fun to buy stuff.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It's exciting, at least for me.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I like to buy stuff.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And so you get all excited
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and wrapped up in the purchase,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and then you don't want to write down all of the costs.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   You don't want to actually do the research
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and say, "Well, if I buy this car,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   "how much is the car insurance going to be?"
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   "Ah, it's $48 a month."
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Or, "Yeah, here's what the depreciation actually is."
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Or, "You know what?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   "If I buy this car,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   "I'm actually going to need to get it washed,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   "and so let me go ahead and add this."
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   If you'll use this technique,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   pluses and minuses,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   one on one page, the other on the other,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   and you'll be honest and complete,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   you'll make better decisions,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   and you'll be able to coach yourself
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   into better decisions.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Write a clear question at the top of the page,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   one page for pros, one page for cons,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   however it's structured within the form of a question,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and fill up the page.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Sleep on it for a night,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   come back the next day,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   look at it, assess,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   talk it over with somebody who's close to you,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   your dad, your mom, your husband, your wife,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   your boss, your employee, your friend.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Very simple, but very few people do it.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Be one of those who does it.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Be back with you soon.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Thank you all for listening.
