[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   You define happiness as progress, is that right?
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.200]   That is my one word definition of happiness, progress.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.620]   Whether it's progress in your finances,
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.280]   in your relationship with your significant other,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.740]   with your children, with a hobby
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.440]   that you're trying to get better at,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.760]   progress is my one word definition of happiness.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.960]   Is that the end goal, is just making progress
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.280]   towards all the things you care about?
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.200]   Is that how you view what money allows you to do
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.680]   or what life's for?
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.240]   You know, it's like one of those interview questions,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.920]   like what is that one word, right?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.000]   So that would be my word,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.080]   but I don't know if that's the end goal.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.240]   I think we always need to be trying to improve ourselves
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.040]   in whatever endeavor we take on.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.160]   We should probably try to challenge ourselves
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.080]   in something that's a little bit scary,
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.080]   a little bit impossible sounding,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.160]   so that at least we don't look back with regret
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.640]   having not tried our best or not having not tried at all.
