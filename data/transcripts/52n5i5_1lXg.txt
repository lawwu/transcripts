[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.560]   Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians in the third chapter, verses 21, 22, and 23,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.000]   the last three verses in that third chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.360]   "Therefore let no man glory in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.280]   or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   All are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's."
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.200]   Now in these words the apostle brings to a close and to a kind of climax the argument
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.120]   of this entire chapter.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.560]   It's an argument that he really began way back about the tenth verse of the first chapter.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.920]   This is an epistle which deals with a number of problems that had arisen in a church, the
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.280]   church at Corinth.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.840]   And this is the particular problem with which he has been dealing.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.160]   "It has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.920]   Clyde, that there are contentions among you."
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.960]   And the contentions were, as he reminds us again in this third chapter, concerning their
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.480]   various teachers.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.640]   Some saying, "I am of Paul."
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.200]   Others saying, "I am of Apollos."
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.040]   Others say, "I am of Cephas."
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.960]   The church was divided up like this into factions.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.600]   And the apostle is not only disturbed about this, he's alarmed.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   And so he writes and he deals with this in a very full and in a very exhaustive manner.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.920]   And here I say, at the end of this chapter, though he does go on to apply his argument
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.800]   a bit in the fourth chapter, but here essentially at the end of this third chapter, he sums
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.920]   up, winds up his great bit of argumentation and puts the truth very plainly and clearly
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.040]   before them as well as before us.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.200]   And what he really does, of course, is this, is to show them how utterly foolish they are.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.920]   And especially in this, that their behavior and their conduct is entirely inconsistent
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.480]   with the gospel which they have believed and which they claim still to adhere to.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.800]   And that is really the gravamen, as it were, of his whole charge against these people.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.600]   He says, "You are behaving as if you were still worldly people."
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.720]   He says, "Brethren, I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal,
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.120]   even as unto babes in Christ.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.680]   For are you not yet carnal?
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.680]   Whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions, are you not carnal and walk
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680]   as men?"
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.640]   Now that's the ultimate charge which he brings against them, that by being guilty of this,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.480]   they have reverted to an old way of thinking.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.960]   Not the Christian way of thinking, but the worldly way of thinking.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.760]   And therefore he wants them to understand this, he ridicules it, and shows them how
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.560]   monstrous it is for them to be in that position.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.360]   But now, as he does that to them over that particular issue, he, as always is the case
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.440]   with him, he elevates all this into terms of great and eternal principles, so that we
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.680]   find in this chapter one of these great and glorious statements of the Christian gospel
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:54.880]   and the Christian position, and the unutterable folly of mankind in rejecting such a gospel.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.160]   And that's the thing to which I'm calling your attention this evening.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.000]   This is the greatest tragedy of the world, its rejection of the gospel.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.640]   There are many minor tragedies, but this is the explanation of all tragedies.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.600]   The world would never know tragedy, would never have known tragedy, were it not for
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.440]   this folly that afflicts mankind.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:27.360]   And here the apostle deals with this tragic folly of the world and its outlook and its
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.680]   whole way of thinking.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.840]   Now let's put it like this.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.760]   What is the trouble with men?
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.080]   What's the trouble with mankind?
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.600]   What is the essence of the world's trouble, the world's problem this evening?
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.560]   Well the apostle puts it here very plainly.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.720]   He says the ultimate trouble with men is that he is a fool.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.320]   Now that is the charge which he brings, you notice the way he puts it.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.160]   If any man thinketh or seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.360]   he may be made wise, that no man deceive himself.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:15.200]   The biblical case against men as he is by nature is that he is a fool.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.400]   That is the thing that is most frequently said in the Bible about what it calls the
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   sinner.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.360]   And the sinner is a man who doesn't believe in God or who disobeys God deliberately and
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.560]   rejects the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.200]   That is its commonest statement about it.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.480]   That is therefore its definition of sin.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.840]   Sin is folly.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.320]   Sin is many other things.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.680]   Sin is rebellion.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.360]   Sin is transgression of the law.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.320]   Sin is disobedience.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.400]   Sin is missing the mark.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Sin is many other things.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:59.160]   But the thing that the Bible tells us most frequently about it is that it is folly.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.360]   And it is because man is a fool that he disobeys the law of God and does so many of the other
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.200]   things that bring down misery upon him.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.040]   And that is the theme of the apostle here.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:21.120]   He shows the unutterable folly of this worldly, carnal, fleshly way of thinking.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.600]   Now man's folly, according to the apostle here, and it is as I say what the Bible says
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:40.320]   everywhere, man's folly shows itself supremely in his pride and his self-deception.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.440]   This is most amazing.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.800]   Man is proud of himself.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.280]   You see, it is because of that, because he prides himself especially on his wisdom and
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.820]   his thinking and his understanding that he rejects the gospel.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.260]   And he thinks he is doing something very clever and very wonderful.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.820]   But according to the apostle, he is just deceiving himself.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.620]   And what makes him deceive himself is his pride, his self-confidence, his good opinion
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.860]   of himself.
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.900]   That is how man's folly shows itself most plainly and most clearly.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.060]   Man even today with the world as it is, is still proud of himself.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.900]   That is the thing we are confronted by.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.460]   It has always been true of men since the fall.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.260]   It is unusually plain and clear at certain times in history.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.340]   But I feel we are living in an age when it is particularly true.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:41.660]   With the world as it is tonight encompassed by problems, man is still proud of himself,
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.100]   boasting of himself, this twentieth-century man.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:51.220]   And the whole time he is patently and obviously deceiving himself.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.660]   You see, man wants freedom.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.060]   He wants independence.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.860]   Wants happiness.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.300]   Wants to enjoy himself.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.380]   He wants what he calls a full life.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.220]   Everybody wants that.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:13.260]   But the tragedy is that man thinks that he can get all that in his own way and through
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.500]   his own efforts and through the efforts of other men.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.060]   That is his boast.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.340]   That is his great endeavor.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.020]   It is the whole story of civilization.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.620]   Man, he wants all this.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.620]   He believes he can get it.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:32.060]   He has got confidence in himself and in his own capacity.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.140]   But unfortunately he does not succeed.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.060]   And that is why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.060]   That is a part of the self-deception.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.980]   That is a part of the folly.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.940]   That in spite of what men have been saying throughout the centuries, in spite of all
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.140]   that he has been doing, we find the world as it is this evening.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:55.820]   But still we go on with the same self-confidence, the same pride, the same assurance.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.380]   And so the self-deception continues.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.060]   But if you want to see this folly at its greatest height of all, it is to be seen in this.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.980]   Here is man, I say, looking for all that and cannot get it.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.500]   But in this gospel he is offered all that, the very thing he wants.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.100]   And yet he dismisses it.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.420]   He rejects it.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.420]   He curses it.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:25.860]   Here is the height of men's folly, that when he is confronted by an offer which does the
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.340]   very things that he says he is longing for, he deliberately refuses it.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.660]   He regards it as foolishness, folly, as these Greek philosophers did, and still goes on
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.980]   priding himself on his understanding and on his own ability.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:54.300]   So you see, man, in his pride and in his self-deceit, spites himself and robs himself of the most
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.900]   wonderful gifts and blessings that it is possible for him to receive.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.220]   Now that is the thing that the apostle is dealing with here.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.860]   He says, "Therefore let no man glory in men."
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.860]   Why not?
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.860]   Well, he says, "All things are yours.
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.980]   No glory in Paul and Apollos or Cephas.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.900]   All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas."
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.220]   But not only that, he says, "Whether the world or life or death or things present or things
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:26.380]   to come, all things are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's."
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:32.380]   Here are these foolish Corinthians who have got all this but who don't realize it because
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.220]   they've gone back to that worldly way of thinking.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:40.460]   Here they are giving themselves to men when the men are really their possession, and so
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.460]   on.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.460]   Well, now this is his great statement.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.260]   Let me put this to you in a modern form.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.100]   Let me put it to you in the form of three propositions.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:57.460]   The first is, "The folly of glorying in man."
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:02.980]   Let no man glory in men, says the apostle.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.980]   Now what does he mean by glory?
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.100]   Well he means, when you glory in a man, it means that you not only believe in him and
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.860]   what he stands for, but you trust him.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.300]   You rely upon him.
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.380]   You pin your faith to him.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.520]   That's what he means by glorying in men.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.340]   It means that you look to them.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.620]   Now this is precisely what the world is still doing.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.900]   The apostle points out to the Corinthians that in doing this they were reverting, going
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.860]   back to, "Are you not still carnal?
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.460]   You've gone back to the old way of thinking."
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.420]   He says, "That is what the world does."
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.940]   Now that's the point I'm making.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.820]   That is still what the world does.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:51.100]   It is of the very essence of worldly wisdom and of the worldly outlook.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.220]   The modern man rejects God.
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:12:01.420]   He rejects this gospel because he believes in man.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:07.420]   This, remember, glorying in men, is first of all glorying in ourselves.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.540]   These men are just greater than we are, but they're men as we are.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.220]   This is a belief in man, self and other men.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.920]   And the world today is doing this very thing.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:25.220]   It believes that man can solve his problems, that man can put his world in order.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.820]   So the modern man, he looks to his great men.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.100]   Mankind has always done this.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.380]   It's interesting to notice that he doesn't always look to the same types of great men
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.380]   exactly.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:45.060]   I'm old enough to remember when men looked to the statesmen to do everything.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:50.180]   That was the great characteristic of the pre-1914 World War.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:56.260]   It was then a belief in statesmen, politicians, acts of parliament, what these men could do.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.260]   These were the men.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.620]   Well, by today we don't think so much of our politicians.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:05.820]   We've now transferred our glorying to the philosophers, to the great thinkers.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.220]   There are these curious little fashions.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:15.660]   Sometimes we do indeed revert again to the politician, and we almost worship one politician.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.580]   We've done so recently.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.500]   And people, it is a form of glorying.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:25.620]   They can do no wrong, and we pin our faith to them, and we wait upon their every word,
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.940]   and we regard them as almost infallible.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.580]   These are the saviors of the world to be.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.460]   These are the men who are going to put society in order.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.220]   And the world today is doing this very thing.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.220]   Never perhaps has it done it more than it's doing it today.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.300]   We are being told so frequently, and quite truly of course, that the commonest of all
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:52.380]   the cults at the present time is the cult of personality.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.140]   And of course it is the newspapers and the television that are mainly responsible for
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.140]   that.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.100]   The politicians are mainly responsible.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.820]   They take men, they inflate them, they puff them up, and they get the people to believe
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.180]   in them by constantly putting them before them.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.980]   We've seen many examples of this, especially since the last war.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.460]   The characteristic of our age is that it is an age which is taken up completely by the
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.380]   cult of personality.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:21.500]   They literally can take a man and inflate him into almost a god, and people look to
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.860]   them, and they give them almost, I say, that which is worship.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.300]   But according to the apostle, according to the whole of the gospel, the scriptures, this
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.940]   is the cardinal error.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.460]   Let no man glory in men.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.140]   This is the height of folly.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.860]   This is the most idiotic thing that mankind can ever do.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:49.500]   And the apostle here shows us why this is so utterly foolish and so utterly ridiculous.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.940]   Why is it?
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.180]   Why should we not glory in men?
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:58.900]   Now, I mustn't waste your time with details, but you know the glory I'm talking about
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:06.100]   is the foolish adulation that people are giving not only to statesmen and to philosophers,
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:11.940]   but they do it to film stars, they do it to these poor boys who claim to be able to sing,
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.500]   and so on.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.620]   This is the kind of glorying, you know, the excitement and the shouting, and they'll
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.660]   wait for hours in the rain.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.740]   This is the cult of personality, the glorying in men.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:27.180]   Now, why is this at any level so wrong?
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.580]   Why is it, as the apostle says, the height of folly?
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.220]   Well, now let us look and see what he tells us here.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:42.340]   The first thing he tells us is that no man is fit to have such allegiance.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:49.580]   No man is big enough or great enough or fit enough to have anyone glorying in him.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.580]   Why not?
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.060]   Well, because men is, after all, only a creature.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:04.300]   The best men, the greatest men, are only creatures, created beings, as we all are.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.820]   There is no man that has created his own powers, whatever they are.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.540]   A man doesn't even create his own personality.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.260]   A man doesn't create his own gifts.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.260]   They're all given.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.420]   He's born like that.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.700]   These are not things that are determined by man.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.380]   They're out of his hands altogether.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.380]   You may have a gift as a poet.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.940]   Well, you haven't produced it.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.340]   You found you'd got it.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.340]   It was put into you.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.460]   You were born with it.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.940]   And so, with all our gifts.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:36.100]   Now, the apostle puts this very plainly and very clearly in the next chapter.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.500]   He says, "Who maketh thee to differ from another?
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.540]   And what hast thou that thou didst not receive?
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.220]   Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory?
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.460]   And as if thou hadst not received it?"
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.460]   Isn't it utterly idiotic?
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.460]   A man prides himself.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:55.260]   Men or women pride themselves on their appearance.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.660]   But you've got nothing to be proud of.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.220]   You haven't made your face.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.860]   You haven't made your appearance.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.140]   And so, with every other single gift, "What hast thou that thou hast not received?"
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.780]   What is it that makes you to differ from another?
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.300]   Don't be mad, says the apostle.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.900]   Don't pride yourself on that.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.260]   You haven't produced it.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.460]   And you see, he works all this out.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:21.900]   He says, "Now, look at this foolish glorying in me or in Apollos of Cephas."
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:27.340]   He says, "You know, we've got nothing that we haven't received.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.260]   One of us has been given the gift of planting, the other of watering.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.100]   One has been given the gift of laying foundations, another is a builder on that.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.340]   It's all right," he says, "you know, we do these things.
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:44.820]   So then, neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.580]   the increase."
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.700]   If God didn't do that, all that we've done would be absolutely useless.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.420]   It's God that gives the increase.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.620]   Man's powers are all together given to him.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.620]   He doesn't produce them.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   He doesn't create them.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.540]   Man, after all, is a created being.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.540]   He's not a god.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.260]   And we're all created beings.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.340]   And we've all got some gift or another.
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.860]   So there is no point whatsoever in glorying in men.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.900]   It shows a complete misunderstanding of the nature of men.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:22.860]   But not only that, he points out how men's powers at best are very limited.
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.220]   Man at his best can't deal with the ultimate questions.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.980]   Can men deal with the world?
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.980]   Of course he can't.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.260]   They've all failed.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.500]   The men who've been most revered and admired and gloried in, they've all failed to tackle
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.180]   the problem of the world.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:42.460]   Death, things present, things to come, man can't deal with them.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.820]   There is a limit to man's power.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.700]   The really vital questions that you and I are confronted by are questions that man at
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.620]   his best and highest cannot succeed in dealing with.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:01.500]   Not only that, men's powers, the greatest men's powers, they all tend to wane.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.540]   They all tend to fail.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.660]   They're always changing.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.060]   Men themselves are changeable.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.460]   This can be indeed quite laughable.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.580]   You've seen men who've been gloried in and who've been praised, they've changed their
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.580]   opinions.
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.260]   They've gone from one position to the exact opposite.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.580]   And some of them have done it more than once, but still, people still go on glorying in
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.460]   them and believing in them.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.180]   Man is so changeable.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:34.020]   Not only that, his teachings are changing from century to century.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.140]   How often have I pointed out from this pulpit that what is taught today is the exact opposite
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:43.620]   very often of what was taught but a few years back in science and in other realms.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.100]   Changeable and changing, man is unfit to be gloried in because all these things are true
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.100]   of him.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.740]   But still more important is this.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.380]   Man is sinful and man is falible.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.460]   At his best and his highest, he's a failure.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.700]   Every man is a failure.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.100]   He's a creature of sin.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.100]   He's selfish.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.540]   He's untrustworthy in an ultimate sense.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.980]   In the last analysis, he's out for himself.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.380]   He may appear to be philanthropic and so on, but you follow him.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.220]   You get to know all about him.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.580]   Man ultimately is selfish.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.460]   It's the whole cause of the trouble of the human race this evening.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.180]   Now there are some general reasons for you.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.900]   Why it is wrong to glory in men.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:33.380]   Let none of you let no man glory in men.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.500]   But there is something else here which is much more serious.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:44.460]   The apostle points out here that the ultimate end always of glorying in men is slavery.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.580]   This is an astounding thing.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.300]   I say we want to be independent.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.300]   We want to have happiness.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.880]   We want to have joy.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.540]   We want to master life.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.140]   We want to own and possess things.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.340]   That's what we're all about.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.540]   We believe that men can do this for us.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:07.140]   Now the end of that, says the apostle, always is some form or other of slavery.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.780]   You see, that's the thing he's bringing home to these people.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:17.340]   He says, one of you says, "I am of Paul," which means I belong to Paul.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.820]   You see, the Corinthians were not saying that Paul belonged to them.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.140]   They say, "I am of Paul.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.020]   I belong to Paul."
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.820]   Another said, "I belong to Apollos."
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.900]   Another said, "I belong to Cephas."
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:34.620]   And thus they were the possessions of these different men.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.900]   And that, I want to show you, is always true.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:43.940]   Of this glorying in men, we ultimately become their slaves and reduce ourselves to a condition
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.940]   of slavery.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.940]   Let me show it to you.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:52.380]   The ordinary men glory in the so-called great men.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.940]   He becomes their slave, as I've pointed out to you.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.420]   They'll follow him whatever he does.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.540]   And he can't do any wrong.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.540]   There have been some really amusing illustrations of this.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.940]   I take one because I think it's a well-known one and an obvious one.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.500]   I'm not anxious to be political, not to say anything against any one political party.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.940]   It's true of all of them.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.260]   But there was a most amazing demonstration of this very thing in the Communist Party
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.420]   of this country at the beginning of the last war.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.700]   They followed Russia, whatever Russia did.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.420]   Stalin made a pact with Ribbentrop and they believed in it.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.380]   And they followed him in it.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:37.300]   But then when Germany attacked Russia in June 1941, Russia changed.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.500]   So did the followers in this country.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.620]   You see, this is a form of slavery.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.180]   Whatever the master does is right and you follow like sheep, trying to prove to yourself
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.660]   and to others that this is right.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.900]   It's a form of slavery.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.700]   And it happens, I say, in all political parties.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.380]   Men change their parties, their slavish followers go with them.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:01.380]   And it's true not only in the realm of politics, but in many other realms.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:07.900]   The idol changes his opinions and the slaves follow obediently in the same direction.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:14.260]   But not only that, sometimes the men that men believe in and glory in, they become dictators.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.580]   They become tyrannical.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.820]   Who put their faith in Hitler, they didn't think at first he was going to be what he
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.900]   turned out to be.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.340]   They thought he was a good man and had good ideas, but he becomes a dictator, he becomes
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.340]   tyrannical and they have to follow.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.300]   It becomes a form of slavery.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.300]   You elevate any men to that position of control and of infallibility, as it were, you'll end
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.260]   up by being a slave.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.700]   But what is so interesting is this.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.660]   It isn't only the small men who are slaves of the great men.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.460]   The great men are slaves themselves.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.460]   Slaves to what?
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.740]   Slaves to their position.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.500]   Slaves to their popularity.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.420]   Slaves to the number of votes they can count.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.460]   In an extraordinary way, I've been already thinking of these things, but a man told me
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.100]   a thing about a cousin of his, only this last week.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.660]   He said, "You know, this man about whom he was speaking had died suddenly about 30 years
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.340]   ago and we were talking about him.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.820]   He said, you know, it was a good thing in a way that he went."
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.740]   I said, "How on earth do you make that out, leaving a wife and children and a farm and
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740]   so on?"
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:24.100]   "Well," he said, "you know, this man had become a county councillor," he said.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.580]   And you see, like these people, he was so concerned about getting votes and holding
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:34.220]   votes, he was beginning to neglect his farm and his business and even his family.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.420]   He'd become a slave to this.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:41.900]   He told me about another man he knew in local politics like this, who because of his ambition
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:47.340]   in that respect had been neglecting his own children and his sons had all taken to drink
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.300]   and had become a public scandal.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.300]   What's happening?
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.260]   Well, you see, the great man is a slave to his own position.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.460]   He's afraid of losing it.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.240]   He's afraid he won't go in the next time.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.260]   He wants to make sure of his votes, so he gives himself.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.400]   He's not master, he's a slave.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.420]   The poet has seen it.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.940]   Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.700]   You would have thought that the man wearing the crown is at the top.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.700]   He's quite safe.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.700]   No, no.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.140]   Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.500]   He's a slave to the position.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.500]   May there be a rebellion.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.180]   Is somebody else anxious to get my crown?
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.180]   Of course there is.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.100]   There's always somebody, so he's uneasy.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.980]   But you see, the apostle takes us into still greater details.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:38.580]   The result of our glorying in men is that we become slaves to everything, slaves to
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.580]   the world.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:44.100]   Why do you think he brings in here, he says, "All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.100]   or Cephas."
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.780]   And then he goes on, "Or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.780]   come.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.780]   All are yours."
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.780]   What he's saying is this.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.340]   He says, "Look here, don't glory in men.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.620]   Don't make yourselves the slaves of men, but don't make yourselves the slaves of the world,
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.180]   or life, or death, or things present, or things to come."
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.620]   But that is exactly what mankind does.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:08.260]   We all of us by nature are the slaves of these things.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:18.340]   Look at our slavery by nature to the world, the way of the world, the mind of the world,
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.160]   the outlook of the world.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.140]   People tonight are behaving like sheep.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.420]   They're all doing what they're told to do on the television.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.860]   The thing to do is the thing that's done.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.100]   And the age of propaganda and advertising, this is sheer slavery.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.660]   The world, well, the apostle Paul has put it in Ephesians 2, 2, once and forever, "Ye
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.660]   with thee quickened to wear dead in trespasses and sins."
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.860]   He says, "We who once walked according to the course of this world, according to the
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:52.860]   prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.620]   Men and women are slaves to the world and its outlook, its thinking, the thing to do.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.860]   They're slaves to money.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.740]   Now people who have money are slaves to the money.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.520]   People who have great positions are slaves to their positions.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.940]   People who have great positions, they're slaves to the position.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.380]   Haven't we seen them holding on to it at all costs, afraid they're going to lose it?
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.980]   That's slavery, slavery to the world.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.980]   Slaves of life.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.980]   What do I mean?
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:24.540]   Well, afraid of what may happen, afraid of what life may do to you, afraid of what people
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.540]   may think.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.580]   No, that's slavery to life.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.860]   Life is a master of you, and you are the victim, and you are the slave.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.860]   Take death.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:42.020]   Oh, the slavery of mankind to death, the fear of death, the last enemy, the final thing
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.620]   that's approaching us with that sigh of the fear of death.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:55.300]   Mankind is a slave to death, things present, things to come, the uncertainty of life, the
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.420]   possibilities, the foreboding.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.660]   The world today is in a state of slavery.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.900]   It's afraid, afraid of life, afraid of death, afraid of today, afraid of tomorrow.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.900]   What may happen?
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.900]   The world is trembling.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:13.100]   I've often said that is the sole explanation, surely, of the modern pleasure mania.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.900]   It is the fear of mankind and the attempt to get away from it.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.640]   It's not surprising that the drug bill is going up, that all these tranquilizers and
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.780]   other things, it's all mounting up.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.180]   It's the fear of life.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:32.180]   We are the slaves of the world, of life and death and things present and things to come.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:37.220]   But modern men, of course, because he's a fool, because of his pride, he doesn't realize
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.220]   this.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:42.940]   He deceives himself, and he likes the poet who says, "I am the master of my fate.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.220]   I am the captain of my soul."
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.380]   Miserable fool.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:54.360]   You're the slave of everything that's rounded about you, and a slave of the men in whom
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.580]   you pin your faith and whom you think can deliver you.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.820]   No, no, man's not the master of his fate, the captain of his soul.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.500]   He's cringing in fear.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.500]   He doesn't know.
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.100]   He whistles to keep up his courage in the dark, but he's rarely terrified.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:17.300]   That's where glorying in men always and inevitably leads to.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.500]   So the apostle says, "Let no man glory in men."
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.340]   The honorable folly of glorying in men.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.380]   But let me move to the positive.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.460]   Look at the wisdom of glorying in God and in Christ.
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.740]   Here's the thing the apostle tells us.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.380]   You, he says, are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.420]   Miserable Corinthians, don't make yourselves the slave of Paul or of Apollos or of Cephas
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.420]   or of anything else.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:55.060]   There's only one you should be a slave of, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.180]   And he is the servant of God.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.940]   Now, here is the very essence, you see, of the gospel.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:10.780]   If we really want liberty, if we really want mastery of life, it's only to be obtained
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:19.940]   in one way, and that is by believing and surrendering ourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.860]   You notice the contrast, don't you?
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:28.380]   All things are yours, then he gives the list, but you are Christ's.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:33.700]   Christ isn't yours, you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:40.500]   And this I interpret like this, that the gospel is a call to us really to glory in the Lord
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.540]   Jesus Christ.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.900]   Not in man, in any shape or form, not in man's world.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:50.780]   We must glory only in the Lord, in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.580]   Why must we glory in him?
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.260]   Why is it right to glory in him?
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.300]   Why should we all glory in him, whereas we should never glory in him?
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.820]   Well, the answers are endless.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.940]   Here are some of the most important ones.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.980]   You should glory in him because he is who he is.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.620]   Christ is God's.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:19.820]   I said you shouldn't glory in men because men is a created being, as we all are.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.420]   You don't put your final trust in someone who's like yourself, only a created being
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.820]   with all his faculties and powers derived and received.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.820]   No, no.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:36.300]   There is only one who is worthy of our total allegiance, and he is one who is God's eternal
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:42.140]   son, begotten, not created.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.860]   In the beginning was the Word, in the very beginning, when there was no beginning, in
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:52.940]   the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.380]   He is the eternal son of God.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.940]   He is perfect.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.220]   He is sinless.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:04.740]   He is the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:10.740]   He is holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.820]   Look at him, says Paul later on to the Colossians.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.820]   Look at him.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:19.020]   Here is one who appears amongst us as man amongst men.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020]   Who is he?
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.980]   In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead body.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.980]   Who is this?
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:34.300]   Well, all the treasures of God's wisdom and knowledge are all stored in him.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:39.020]   Now, this is why we should put our trust in him and not in men, and why we should put
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.500]   our trust in him and in him alone.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.940]   He is co-equal with God the Father.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.980]   But Paul says here, Christ is God's.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.740]   What does he mean?
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.220]   You say to me, how can you say that he is co-equal with God if he belongs to God?
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.980]   Ah, you see, this is where the glorious Gospel comes in.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:06.580]   There are the three blessed persons in the Holy Trinity, co-equal, co-eternal.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:15.180]   But for the sake of us and our redemption and the redemption of the whole world, they
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:21.420]   decided in eternal counsel to form a plan of salvation.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:28.540]   And this is how it worked out, the Father's great plan, and the Son is the one who is
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.060]   sent to carry it out.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:34.140]   And that meant that for the time being he has to humble himself, he has to take on human
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.140]   nature.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.140]   So he takes a place of subordination.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.780]   He humbles himself under the Father to be his servant and to live a life in dependence
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.760]   on him in this world of time.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.540]   It is in that sense that he is God's.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.620]   It is this voluntary humiliation of the Son of God.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:58.940]   So he has come into the world in order to work out God's great plan of redemption.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:04.340]   Now you and I, mankind is interested in the world and the condition of the world and a
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.100]   happy life in this world and enjoyment of the things that are in this world.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.860]   We try, I say, through men and we can't get it.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.940]   Now the world is the Lord and the fullness thereof.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.220]   He owns it all.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.220]   He made it all.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.220]   It is his.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.300]   He keeps it in existence and in being.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.220]   It's all in his hands.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   It's gone wrong.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:30.580]   But God has planned a way whereby it can all be restored.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.540]   And he has done this through sending his Son into the world.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.700]   When the fullness of the times had come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.980]   under the law, to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.820]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.620]   So here is the one through whom all this is happening, this Christ, this Lord, that's
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.340]   who he is.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.860]   Then consider what he has done.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:05.860]   He came into this world as the Son of Man, submitting himself to the Father, saying that
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:10.300]   he can do nothing of himself but only what the Father tells him and gives him to do,
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.260]   that he can speak nothing of himself, though he is the eternal Son of God.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.420]   But in this state of humiliation, he depends upon his Father.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.620]   Why has he come?
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.300]   He tells us, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.940]   He has come to undo the works of the devil.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:32.500]   He has come to restore all that God made and that men has marred by his sin and the devil
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.680]   led men to do it.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.020]   He has come to restore it all to its perfect condition."
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.020]   How has he done it?
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.660]   Well, I've told you, he has humbled himself.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.540]   He is born as a man, he lives as a man.
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:51.060]   He dies on a cross, he is buried in a grave, but he rises again and returns to heaven.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.060]   What has he been doing?
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:57.540]   Well, what he has been doing is to deal with all our problems, the problems that make us
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.500]   what we are and make our life and our world what they are.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.420]   And the greatest of all these problems is the problem of our guiltiness before God,
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.380]   that we have offended God's law and his person and his wrath is upon us.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.700]   We are all guilty and the first problem is we must be delivered from this guilt.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.900]   It's the thing that leads to all our other troubles.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.900]   We can't do it.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.020]   He has come and he has done it.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.020]   No man can do it.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.540]   "Paul hasn't died for you," says Paul himself in the first chapter.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.700]   Was Paul crucified for you?
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.500]   Were you baptized in the name of Paul?
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.060]   He says, "Don't worry in me.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.660]   I can't do the thing you need most of all and that is to rid you of the guilt of your
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.660]   sin.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.020]   There's only one who can.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.060]   He's the one to glory in.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.340]   He's the one to give yourself to."
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.100]   He has died for our sins.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.420]   He was wounded for our transgressions.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.540]   He has died our death under the law.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.540]   He was made of a woman made under the law that he might redeem them that are under the
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:54.540]   law.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.340]   And not only that, he has defeated our every enemy.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.340]   Who are your enemies?
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.980]   Who are my enemies?
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.580]   Who are the enemies of the whole world tonight?
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.940]   You know the enemy of mankind?
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.700]   It's not a nation, it's not a man, it's not a group of nations.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.700]   The enmity in the world is not ultimately and primarily between warring nations.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:21.860]   It is the devil against God, the devil against man, the devil against God's creation.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:26.940]   And you and I before we can ever know happiness and peace must be delivered from the dominion
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.900]   of the devil, the dominion of Satan.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.860]   He's our chiefest enemy and we need to be delivered from him.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.700]   No man can deliver us from the devil because no man has ever been able to defeat him.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.460]   He's defeated them all.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.460]   Read your Bible.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:44.460]   The great saints, the great patriarchs, the best men of the Old Testament, every one of
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.340]   them was defeated by the devil.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.980]   The world has only seen one person who has been able to conquer the devil.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.500]   It is this Christ, this Son of God.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.460]   That's why he alone deserves our allegiance.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.900]   He's conquered the devil.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.900]   He's fulfilled the law.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.300]   Yay.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.580]   He mastered life.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.780]   He was mastered by life.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.700]   He went through it triumphantly, he mastered it.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:13.380]   He was the controller of everything in it and the last enemy came and met him and the
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.980]   devil thought that at last he'd got him but he didn't.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.740]   He has conquered death, the last enemy.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.180]   He has risen triumphant o'er the grave.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.300]   That's what he's done and because of what he's done he deserves your allegiance and
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.940]   mine but all.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.660]   Look at this, look at his present position.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:38.180]   Here we are, slaves of the world, slaves of life, slaves of death, slaves of things present,
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.740]   slaves of things to come, terrified, frightened, the world and all its forces.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.620]   What can we do?
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.740]   My dear friend, look to him.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:54.420]   There he is, seated at the right hand of God's glory, saying even before he left this world,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.020]   "All power is given unto me.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.500]   All power is given unto me."
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.660]   And when he says that, he means that it's true.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.500]   He has all power in his hands.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:11.100]   Jesus Christ is the Lord of history.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.980]   There is nothing that happens apart from him.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.500]   History is not just working out itself as the result of some blind and controllable
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.740]   forces.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:24.220]   God permits a great deal but God is controlling history and he's handed it all over to his
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.220]   son.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.100]   Now, those of you who still know something about your Bibles will remember the great
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.100]   picture that is given in the fifth chapter of the last book of the Bible, the book of
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.100]   Revelation.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.420]   And there you see the whole thing is put quite plainly in a very dramatic form before us.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.420]   Listen to this.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.740]   "And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.820]   on the back side, sealed with seven seals, a book in the hand of God."
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.820]   This is a vision.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:53.900]   "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, 'Who is worthy to open the
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.100]   book and to unloose the seals thereof?'"
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.100]   This is the book of history.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:02.300]   Who is big enough and strong enough to be the master and the lord of history, to open
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.900]   the book and to control its carrying out?
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:10.020]   "And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book,
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.020]   neither to look thereon."
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:17.900]   And John says, "And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.180]   book, neither to look thereon."
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.180]   It's hopeless.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.540]   There is no man who can do it.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.540]   Paul can't.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.540]   Apollos can't.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.540]   Cephas can't.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.540]   Your patriarchs can't.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.540]   Nobody can.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.300]   No man is big enough and great enough to control the book of history, not one.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.940]   And John weeps, and mankind is still weeping.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:43.140]   "And one of the elders said unto me, 'Weep not, don't cry, don't break your heart.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:49.500]   Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.300]   book and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:57.260]   And I beheld, and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts, and in the midst of the
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:02.060]   elders stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.420]   the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:11.060]   And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:16.220]   And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.620]   the lamb, having every one of them harps with golden vials full of orders, which are the
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:26.700]   prayers of saints, and they sung a new song, saying, 'Thou art worthy to take the book
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:33.820]   and to open the seals thereof, for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood,
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:39.140]   out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation, and hast made us unto our gods,
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:44.220]   kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.'
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.580]   That's why I say you should glory in him.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.780]   He's big enough, he's the only one who is, to rule history.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.140]   He's the Lord of history.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.580]   You'll get the same thing stated in the fifteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.300]   But wait a minute.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   He is worthy of our allegiance, not only because of what he's done and because of where he
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:09.260]   is now, he is worthy of it because of what he's yet going to do.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.900]   I started by describing the state of the world, you know it, the war, the trouble, the misery,
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.940]   the unhappiness, the wretchedness, the slavery, the failure.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.100]   My dear friends, this isn't going to go on forever.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.540]   There's an end to all this.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.420]   I don't know when it's going to be, but there is going to be an end.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.380]   He's going to come back.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.860]   He'll come back riding the clouds of heaven, King of kings, Lord of lords.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.900]   He'll conquer all his enemies.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.820]   He will destroy the devil and sin and evil.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.780]   He'll purge the cosmos of all that is wrong.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:48.740]   He'll come and set up his eternal kingdom and he'll reign in it forevermore.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.660]   There shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.140]   That's why I say put your allegiance to him.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.140]   You are Christ's.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.020]   Why are you giving yourself to men?
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:02.260]   You are Christ's, this one who is reigning and who is coming to reign visibly, openly
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.780]   over the whole universe.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:11.020]   But you see, I don't stop there.
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.380]   It's all right, says someone, but what has all that got to do with me?
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.380]   I'll tell you.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.100]   This is what it's got to do with you.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:24.420]   You believe in this blessed person, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.820]   Believe in him as the Son of God, the God-man.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.580]   Believe in his atoning work.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.020]   Believe in his resurrection.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.100]   Believe in his reign.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.860]   Believe in his coming.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.100]   Believe in him, give yourself to him, trust yourself to him, look only to him and rely
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.100]   only upon him.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.220]   Do you know what happens to you?
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.180]   You belong to him.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.340]   You receive of his nature.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.340]   You become a partaker through him of the divine nature.
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.220]   You become a child of God.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.220]   You are born again.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.740]   You have a new nature and a new start.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.500]   You've got a principle of divine life in you.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:06.340]   And as the apostle argues in writing to the Romans, if children, then heirs, heirs of
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:11.540]   God and joint heirs with Christ, you are Christ's.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:17.860]   You are in Christ and Christ is in you so that what is true of him becomes true of you.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:23.260]   And it is because of that the apostle can say, "All things are yours because they're
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.260]   his."
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.260]   They belong to him.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.780]   He's purchased them by his coming, by his death and by his resurrection.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.780]   He has bought them.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.700]   He has redeemed them.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.060]   And they belong to him.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.060]   But we belong to him and we are in him.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.740]   We were Christ's and Christ is God's.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:45.580]   So that brings me, you see, to my last principle, which I would put like this to you.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.100]   Here are the steps.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.440]   The apostle works them out.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:55.460]   The unutterable folly of putting your trust in men and glorying in men.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:01.340]   The essential, secondly, the essential wisdom of glorying in the Lord Jesus Christ and putting
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:08.540]   your trust and confidence entirely and utterly in him, the last.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.580]   The results of doing so.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.900]   And that is where Paul is amazed at these foolish Corinthians.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:22.860]   "What," he says, "giving yourself to men, to me or to Apollos or to Cephas, and thereby
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:28.300]   becoming our slaves and becoming the slaves of the world and life and death and things
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.980]   present and things to come?"
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.980]   He says, "You're mad.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.340]   You don't understand your thinking as the world thinks.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.340]   You've gone back to your old carnal way of thinking."
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.940]   He says, "Don't you realize it?
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.020]   All things are yours.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.340]   All things are yours."
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.620]   He repeats that.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:48.300]   "All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.900]   things present or things to come.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.220]   All things are yours.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.180]   And you are Christ's and Christ is God's."
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.180]   What's he mean?
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.260]   The whole thing is this.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:03.580]   You put your trust and confidence in Christ and glory in him and in him alone, and what
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:09.980]   will happen to you is this, that instead of being the slaves of men and of the world and
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:18.220]   of life and of death and of things present and of things to come, they become yours.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.020]   And they will be your servants and your ministers.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.700]   You will own them.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.940]   Now, let me show you how he proves this.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.900]   He says, "This happens to men."
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.780]   He says, "All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas."
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.220]   The only way they were giving themselves to these men.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.900]   He says, "You know, we rarely are yours."
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:44.300]   He goes on in the next chapter, "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:49.100]   and stewards of the mysteries of God."
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.900]   He says, "You know, I as an apostle am rarely your servant."
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:58.100]   He says it again in the second epistle to the Iscariotians, "We preach not ourselves,
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:06.140]   but Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake."
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.740]   We are your servants, he says.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.740]   Don't glory in us.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:12.860]   You know, he's called us and he's given us the revelation and he's filled us with the
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:18.060]   Spirit and given us our varied abilities in order that we may minister to you.
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.220]   We are only the ministers, the stewards of these mysteries.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.220]   We haven't thought them up.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.620]   They're not the result of our meditation and thinking and brilliance.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.380]   He's given it his all and he's given it all to us in order that we may give it to you.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:35.180]   You go read Ephesians chapter 4 and you'll find he says the same thing, that Christ,
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:40.300]   when he rose up on high, he ascended up on high and he gave gifts unto men.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.900]   And you remember how he works it out.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.380]   He works it out like this.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:49.340]   He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.340]   What for?
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.620]   For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:59.020]   the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.780]   the Son of God and to a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:03.780]   of Christ.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.860]   Apostles have been brought into being for our sakes.
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.860]   They're ours.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.860]   They're our servants.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.860]   Even apostles.
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:16.060]   That's why I, for one, don't bow my knee to any pope or to any bishop or any such thing.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.620]   There are no lords in the church.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.140]   Peter himself says it, not lording it over God's heritage.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.580]   We are only sharers with you of these things.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.060]   No, no, there's only one Lord.
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.020]   And popes and bishops, if you believe in such things, are your ministers.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.420]   They're your servants.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:38.060]   God raised these apostles and all other orders in the church for our sakes.
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.020]   They belong to us.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:44.020]   And the moment you become a Christian, you'll find that all other men are the same thing.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.900]   You'll be able to use them all as your servants.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.820]   I use Shakespeare as a servant, now and again, don't I?
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.100]   And I use these poets, you know, they're all my servants.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.300]   I'm not their slave.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.500]   I was once and I used to hold on.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.980]   They're everywhere no longer.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.660]   I can pick and choose.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.620]   There are some things about some of them I'm not interested in and I don't want them.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.620]   I'm the master.
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.620]   They're my servants.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.460]   And there are many of them.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.820]   No, no, don't give yourselves to men.
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:09.820]   You are the master.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.820]   They're yours.
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.620]   There it is with men.
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.620]   What about the world?
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.020]   Well, he says, the world is yours.
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.020]   What?
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.020]   The world, mine as a Christian?
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.900]   Yes, the world is mine.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.780]   The world is mine because I belong to Christ and it's his.
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.500]   He's purchased it, as I say.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.460]   The Father has also given it to him.
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.740]   But I want to show you how this works itself out.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:38.020]   The world is already mine, in a sense, but you know there's a day coming when it's going
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.660]   to be mine and that of every other Christian's in the fullest sense possible.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:49.220]   Our Lord himself said, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.620]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.020]   You're interested in inheritances.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.260]   You're interested in legacies.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:00.460]   If you really want to inherit the whole world, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.460]   Blessed are the meek.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:05.020]   Those who don't trust in themselves or to men but to him alone.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:09.060]   Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:14.100]   But you know there is a sense in which even in the here and now, the world is mine.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:20.800]   Well, the moment you become a Christian, you see this world in an entirely different way.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.080]   It becomes transfigured.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:28.180]   You see it now as the work of God's fingers, the work of God's hands.
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:33.820]   When I see the sun and the moon and the stars and all that thou hast created.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:41.060]   You see, the tragedy of sin as Paul works out in Romans 1 from verse 18 onwards is this.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.580]   That man has become blind even to the creation.
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.580]   He doesn't see it.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:48.620]   He's without excuse, says Paul.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.780]   God has made the world and he's left his marks there.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.500]   Man's become blind, he doesn't see it.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.580]   He ought to believe in God through nature if he had nothing else.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.100]   But he's blind and he can't do it.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:01.980]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian and his mind is renewed and enlightened in its
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:08.540]   spirit, he looks upon the world in an entirely new way and he sees the marks of God.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.060]   Look at these flowers.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.340]   I don't look at the flowers as a botanist.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.700]   I don't just dissect it.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.860]   No, no, I see God in his perfection, in his arrangement, in his design.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.340]   It's the glory of God.
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:21.340]   Man can't do this.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:24.060]   He can produce fairly good imitations, but it's not the real.
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.060]   It's not the living.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.060]   It's not the vital thing.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.260]   And look at it all, the mountains and the hills, the streams, the animals.
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:33.260]   All is a manifestation of the glory of this great God.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.300]   But it takes a Christian to see these things.
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.260]   Now Paul puts it, you remember preaching in Lystra.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:41.420]   Look at the seasons, spring, summer, autumn, winter.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.620]   Where did they come from?
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.460]   Has man invented them?
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.360]   Is it modern man who's invented the seasons?
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.940]   Is it modern man who's invented how these things grow?
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:52.740]   Is it modern man who sends the rain and the sun?
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.740]   Of course it isn't.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.740]   This is God.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.460]   This is the great creator.
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:00.460]   And once a man becomes a Christian, he looks at it all.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.020]   He sees it in a new way.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.140]   Or let me quote a hymn which puts it all so perfectly.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.140]   This is what becomes true of the Christian.
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.740]   "Heaven above, his softer bloom.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:13.380]   Earth around, his sweeter green.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:19.460]   Something lives in every hue Christless eyes have never seen.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.620]   Birds with gladder, songs overflow.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.660]   Flowers with deeper beauties shine.
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.740]   This I know as now I know.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.380]   I am his and he is mine."
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:39.980]   The world has to produce its paint and it's painting everything more and more and more.
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:40.980]   Why?
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:45.660]   Because it's no longer alive and sensitive to the beauty of a flower in an infinitely
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.340]   greater sense than even Wordsworth ever knew.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:54.300]   To me the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that often lie too deep for tears.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:00.980]   The munificence of God scattering them on moorlands, mountainsides, these little beauties,
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.820]   glories, the heavenly father, the world is mine.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:09.700]   In a way that the men who own the land have never seen it and have never owned it.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.700]   But what of life itself?
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:16.260]   "Well," says this man, Paul, "to the Philippians, to me, to live is Christ.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:17.260]   Life becomes new."
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.260]   The Christian is not mastered by life.
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.860]   He's the master of life.
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.860]   What is life?
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:25.460]   "Life is here an opportunity for me to get to know Christ.
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.420]   It is an opportunity for me to tell other people about him.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.740]   It is a kind of preparatory school.
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.300]   That's my view of life now.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.340]   Life to the unbeliever is the only life and it all ends with death.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.060]   But it isn't true.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.380]   And this isn't real life as we see it depicted in the world.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   No, no, life is a big thing.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:45.380]   It's a great thing.
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.380]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.380]   It's a gift of God.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.260]   And I'm being prepared for the glory that awaits me.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.740]   I am the owner, the master of life."
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   What of death then?
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:58.020]   This tyrant, this enemy, this thing that gets us down, the fear of death?
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.780]   "Well," says Paul, "to me, to live is Christ.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.660]   And to die is gain."
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.980]   Death, what is it?
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:11.300]   Death to the Christian is nothing but a little rivulet that separates this world of sin and
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:17.780]   shame and woe from a glory which is indescribable.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:22.340]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews tells us that Christ has delivered those who through
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:28.100]   fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.780]   Death is no longer my master.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.140]   Death becomes my servant.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:37.900]   And the business of this particular servant is just to take me and to usher me into the
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.860]   presence of my King, my Lord, and my God.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.260]   Death is mine.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.900]   I'm no longer frightened of it and enslaved by it.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:48.820]   What of the present and what of the future?
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.620]   Well, it's the same thing.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.380]   It's all in the hands of Christ.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.700]   Nothing can happen to me apart from him.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:03.380]   He is the Lord of history until time shall be no more.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.620]   What about things present and things to come?
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:11.940]   Well, all I know is this, that all things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.940]   All things.
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.900]   I don't care what they are.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.900]   Things present, things to come.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.660]   These are the things that terrify people, not the Christian.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:26.900]   He knows that whatever may happen to him, all things work together for good to them
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:27.900]   that love God.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:32.340]   Indeed, this same apostle puts it like this in the second epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.820]   chapter 4.
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:36.020]   He was surrounded by trials and troubles.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:40.020]   He was really almost from the human standpoint overwhelmed by them.
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.740]   Persecutions, trial, illnesses, all sorts of things.
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:48.260]   He looks at them all and he says, "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.780]   for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:57.340]   You see, trials and troubles and tribulations become our servant and they work for us a
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:00.780]   far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:05.380]   Well, we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:09.420]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.420]   What about the future?
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.420]   What about things to come?
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.420]   Are you frightened of them?
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.420]   I am not frightened of them.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:19.260]   For I am told in Hebrews 2, 5, "Not unto angels hath he put in subjection the world
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.260]   to come of which we speak."
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.260]   Future.
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.260]   What is the future?
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:29.020]   Well, the future is this, that this glorious day is coming when Christ will return, the
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:36.220]   world to come, the world glorified, the universe restored to God with no sin.
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:37.540]   And that belongs to me.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.060]   He is not preparing it even for angels.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.620]   Did you know that even angels are our servants?
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.340]   What are they, says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews?
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:51.460]   They are but ministering servants sent by God to minister unto the heirs of salvation.
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.660]   Why, even the angels are our servants.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.300]   All things are yours.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.020]   There is nothing which is not yours.
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:04.340]   Now my friends, that is why we must not glory in men.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:13.660]   That is why we must glory only in him who is the Lord of creation, the Lord of history,
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.440]   the Lord of glory.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:19.220]   My dear friend, here is the question for you.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.740]   Are you the slave of the world?
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.380]   Are you the slave of men?
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.380]   Are you the slave of life?
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.300]   Are you the slave of death?
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:30.900]   Are you the slave of things present or the slave of things to come?
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:34.460]   Shall you glory in men, in yourself and other men?
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:37.060]   You will remain a slave.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:42.540]   Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and the things to which you were formerly a slave will be
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:48.260]   transformed into your servants if the Son shall set you free.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:59.340]   You shall be free indeed and all things will be yours and you will enjoy them in time and
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:05.060]   you will enjoy them perfectly in the glory everlasting.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.300]   Have you believed in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.140]   Have you given yourself to him?
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.700]   Do you pin your faith to him, do you glory in him?
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.180]   Have you seen the futility of trusting men?
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:21.780]   And have you put your trust, your life, your death, your everything entirely and unreservedly
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:26.420]   in the hands of the Son of God?
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:30.060]   Amen.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:33.980]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
