[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.180]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.520]   Today, my guest is Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.040]   Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg is the chair
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.800]   of the Department of Ophthalmology
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.200]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.880]   He is a clinician, an MD or medical doctor
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.240]   who sees patients every week, as well as a PhD,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.800]   meaning a laboratory scientist
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.600]   who directs his own laboratory focused
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.960]   at understanding the mechanisms and cures
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.920]   for diseases of the eye and vision,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.680]   such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa,
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.820]   and macular degeneration.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.040]   Indeed, Dr. Goldberg is one of the world leaders
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520]   in developing methods to cure blindness.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.680]   He is also intensely knowledgeable
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.160]   about all things related to vision.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.840]   So during today's discussion,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.040]   we indeed cover most all of visual and eye health.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.320]   You will learn, for instance, about the benefits
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.480]   as well as drawbacks of wearing corrective lenses,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.280]   such as contact lenses or eyeglasses for reading.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.040]   You will learn about the benefits
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.240]   and detriments of sunlight,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.560]   meaning how it can help your vision,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.280]   in fact, how it can help reverse
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820]   or prevent myopia, nearsightedness,
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.620]   as well as the things to be cautious about
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.260]   with respect to sunlight in terms of development
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.920]   of cataracts, which are occlusions that prevent vision.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.280]   We also discuss many tools for maintaining
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.800]   and improving vision across the lifespan,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.620]   ranging from behavioral tools,
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.840]   so specific vision tasks and exercises for the eye
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.000]   that you can do that are known to improve
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.560]   or maintain your vision,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.920]   as well as specific surgical procedures,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.700]   such as LASIK surgery.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.960]   We get into all the details of, for instance,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.520]   how often to do these various eye exercises,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.720]   how long the benefits are maintained,
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.840]   as well as age-related considerations
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.940]   for things like LASIK eye surgery.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.420]   We even get into how to best clean your contact lenses,
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.800]   whether or not to use disposable contact lenses
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.640]   or other forms of contact lenses.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.540]   We also discuss things like dry eye
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.780]   and the best remedies for dry eye.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.260]   And we talk about the scientific and clinical data
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.800]   around nutritional approaches
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.680]   and supplementation-based approaches
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.740]   for maintaining and improving vision.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.720]   So whether or not you suffer from floaters or dry eye,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.300]   or you're considering changing your eye prescription,
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.620]   or you have concerns about whether or not
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.640]   relying on corrective lenses is impairing your vision,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.800]   and you want to enhance your vision,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.820]   or if you're somebody who has perfect vision,
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.900]   today's episode is going to include science and protocols
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.680]   that will be highly relevant to you.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.240]   I should also add that if you are somebody
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.800]   who suffers from, or who has family members
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.920]   who suffer from diseases of the eye that can impact vision,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.220]   such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa,
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.840]   and macular degeneration,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.200]   we also delve deep into the discussion
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.720]   about the most advanced technologies
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.760]   for preventing and offsetting vision loss
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760]   due to those diseases as well.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.400]   Thanks to Dr. Goldberg's incredible knowledge,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.200]   his clarity of communication,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.380]   and his generosity with that knowledge,
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.040]   by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.120]   you will be armed with all of the modern information you need
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.820]   in order to best maintain and improve
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.680]   your eye and vision health.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.440]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.160]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.200]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.160]   to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.260]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.640]   to the general public.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.720]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.480]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.940]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.200]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.840]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.200]   I've talked before on this podcast
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.960]   about the key importance of striving to get
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.800]   one gram of protein per pound of body weight.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.180]   And when one strives to do that,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.160]   it's also important to maximize
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.620]   the quality protein-to-calorie ratio.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.780]   In other words, you don't want to consume
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.160]   a lot of extra calories in order to get your quality protein.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.400]   Maui Nui Venison, in having an extremely high-quality protein
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.560]   and nutrient-to-calorie ratio,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.500]   allows you to do that very easily.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.600]   And in addition to that,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.400]   Maui Nui Venison is delicious.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.040]   I particularly like their bone broth,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.560]   which has an unmatched 25 grams of protein
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.480]   per 100 calories.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.340]   I also love their ground venison and their venison steaks.
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.480]   All of them are absolutely delicious.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.220]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.360]   go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.640]   and get 20% off your first order.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.160]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.360]   Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.040]   that is the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.920]   but nothing you don't, which means no sugar.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.720]   It's critical that we get electrolytes
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.480]   because every cell of our body,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   but in particular, our nerve cells, our neurons,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.240]   rely on electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.200]   With Element, it's very easy to ingest
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.720]   the correct ratios of electrolytes.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.240]   They come in these little packets.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.080]   They're really delicious.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.480]   You mix them up with anywhere from eight to 16
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.180]   to 32 ounces of fluid.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.840]   I like mine pretty concentrated,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.680]   so I'll drink a 16 ounce glass of water
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.260]   with Element in it when I first wake up.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.940]   I'll also consume another one of those,
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.920]   maybe 32 ounces with one packet when I exercise,
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.400]   and maybe another one if I happen to sweat a lot
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.300]   during exercise or if I was in the sauna and sweating a lot,
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.960]   if it's a very hot day, et cetera.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.720]   If you'd like to try Element, go to drink element,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.360]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.680]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.280]   Again, that's drink element, lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.680]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.640]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.480]   Now, there's absolutely no question
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.560]   that sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.040]   physical health, and performance.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.440]   When we're sleeping well and we're sleeping long enough,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.740]   everything in our daily life goes that much better.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.400]   Now, a key component to getting a great night's sleep
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.800]   is the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.860]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.800]   your core body temperature actually has to drop
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.580]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.760]   Conversely, in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.720]   your core body temperature has to increase
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.480]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.000]   With Eight Sleep mattress covers,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.640]   you can cool or heat your mattress at the beginning,
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.160]   middle, and end of your night
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.000]   in order to optimize your night's sleep.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.900]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.960]   about two years ago,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.560]   and it has dramatically improved the sleep that I get
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.440]   each and every night.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.760]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.440]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.940]   and save up to $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.920]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.040]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.380]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.820]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.160]   Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, welcome.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.720]   - Thanks, it's great to be here.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.640]   - You and I go way back.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.680]   We will spare people the discussion about all of that,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.720]   but I'm really excited for today's discussion
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.960]   because I get a tremendous number of questions
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.640]   about vision and eye health.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.120]   And of course, as a neuroscientist
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.680]   who has worked on the visual system,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.680]   I sometimes have answers or partial answers,
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.640]   but more often than not, I don't have the answers.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.240]   And yet I'm confident that you do,
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.000]   or that if you don't, you can direct us
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.440]   to the proper place to get those answers.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.000]   So to kick things off,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.680]   I want to ask you what was one
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.680]   of the most commonly asked questions
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.840]   when I solicited for questions
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.340]   in anticipation of this episode,
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.340]   which is how early should one do an eye exam on their child?
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.480]   And how regularly should we all be doing eye exams?
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.080]   Also is the fact that I think I can see normally,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.880]   confirmation that I can see as well as I think I can.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.060]   So that's really three questions, but baby comes out,
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.520]   do they check their eyes right away?
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.560]   And if so, how, and how often should they check?
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.920]   And what kind of information is there?
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.880]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.340]   It's obviously something that touches us all.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.860]   So the answer to that really differs a little bit
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.100]   at the different stages of life.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.780]   First of all, every baby gets an eye exam
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.640]   or should be getting an eye exam.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.660]   And one of the main things
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.680]   that you really just are screening for right
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.160]   when that baby is born, right in the nursery,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.800]   right in those first few days,
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.600]   is to just look for a red reflex.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.020]   You know, when you take a camera picture, a flash picture,
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.680]   and sometimes you get red eye,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.420]   that's actually the light from the flashes,
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.240]   you know, reflecting against the retina
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.040]   and coming back out of your eye, it looks red.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.760]   And a red reflex is actually very normal, that's great.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   And if you have one of a number of diseases in the eye
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.000]   that can present even in babies, even in newborn babies,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.160]   including most concerning,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.960]   but thankfully least common, retinoblastoma,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.920]   which is the most common pediatric eye cancer,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.700]   which again, thankfully is quite rare,
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.820]   those babies won't have a red reflex in that eye.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.180]   It'll be kind of a whitish or gray reflex.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.220]   And so even just that first little, you know,
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.900]   doctor's taking the little pen light
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.240]   and even just flashing it in the baby's eyes.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.480]   So that's our first eye exam.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.100]   And hopefully we've all had that.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.860]   And hopefully every baby being born today
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.500]   is getting that first eye exam,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.840]   is really just looking for that red reflex.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.500]   It's not typical as long as that's looking good.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.720]   To worry about getting an eye exam from there,
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.920]   kind of through childhood,
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.200]   like maybe early elementary school,
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.720]   unless your baby is presenting with
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.980]   one of a number of features that parents often pick up on.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.260]   For example, as the baby's aging
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.460]   through those first couple of years,
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.780]   you know, through the first couple of years,
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.060]   babies actually don't have great visual acuity.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.380]   And so as they're aging over those first couple of years,
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.940]   it's normal for them to have, you know, roving eye movements,
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.320]   for example, be searching their environment.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.120]   But over those first couple of years,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.920]   if parents start noticing the baby isn't,
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.560]   you know, isn't making eye contact
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.520]   or looking where a sound is,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.440]   certainly if they have what's called nystagmus,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.000]   like these rapid flickering alternating eye movements,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.120]   anything like that, of course,
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.440]   you're gonna trigger an eye exam.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.120]   But otherwise, most babies,
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.320]   other than their pediatrician doing that red reflex check
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.920]   when they're in for their regular well child checks,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   that's really all that's needed through that.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.700]   When most kids get to elementary school age,
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.760]   there'll often be, often done at the schools,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.580]   an amblyopia screening exam.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.620]   If kids' eyes either, if one eye doesn't see that well,
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.880]   like maybe you're very nearsighted or farsighted in one eye
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.640]   and pretty normal sighted in the other,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.160]   or the two refractive errors
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.560]   are quite different from each other,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.600]   that can lead to a condition you've talked about
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.220]   on the podcast before called amblyopia,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.360]   which is probably one of the more common
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.260]   or most common eye diseases of children.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.320]   Or if the eyes aren't aligned,
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.360]   you know, our eye muscles and the brain behind them
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   are really responsible for keeping the two eyes
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.560]   looking straight ahead.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.440]   And if that's not working properly
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.520]   and one eye is off kilter,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.880]   and therefore the image of what we're looking at
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.800]   is falling on different spots of the retina,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.120]   it's not sinking upright in the brain,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.880]   that can lead to this disease condition called amblyopia
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.640]   where that eye is no longer talking to the brain properly.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.440]   And there's a pretty easy screening exam
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.940]   that can be done for strabismus,
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.500]   the misalignment of the eyes
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.520]   that kids will do in elementary school.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.480]   The other main presenting symptom
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.040]   of kids in elementary school
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.560]   is when they admit to their parents,
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.600]   I can't see the board or I can't see the teacher upfront,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.320]   and then they might be quite nearsighted.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.100]   And so that will also trigger an exam.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.280]   And so those are usually the parts for babies,
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.240]   for toddlers, for children, school-aged children
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.760]   that might reasonably trigger an exam.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.800]   - A couple of questions about early eye exams,
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.440]   and we'll get onto eye exams
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.400]   in older individuals in a second,
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.920]   but I want to interrupt you with this question.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.960]   So you mentioned that, you know,
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.360]   there can be a misalignment of the eyes.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.440]   I've seen many people's babies
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.840]   where there is one eyeball
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.320]   that seems to be kind of drifting around
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.940]   and then it might correct, but sometimes they'll have a,
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.280]   we don't want to get technical here,
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.200]   but for our listeners, we'll keep it general,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   but either convergent eyes or one eye converging,
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.840]   cross eyes or wall-eyed, you know,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.760]   again, using that non-technical language here.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.400]   And my understanding is that the brain
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.120]   is taking that information in and it's very plastic,
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.100]   it's changing at these early stages of development,
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.660]   and that it's fairly critical
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.440]   to get that stuff corrected early on,
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.980]   because if you wait too long,
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.240]   the brain can essentially become blind to the,
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.640]   or rather the brain cannot learn
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.160]   to handle the proper alignment.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   So in other words, if a kid has crossed eyes,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.560]   crossed eyes, excuse me,
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.820]   and they're not corrected until their 20s,
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.440]   it's possible that they will never recover normal vision,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.360]   whereas if you align the eyes properly early in development,
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.680]   they can indeed recover vision.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.760]   How early can and should one consider
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.880]   getting those eye realignments done?
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.920]   - Yeah, yeah, pretty much right on.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.760]   What they'll do is if they detect any eye misalignment,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.560]   and sometimes parents are good at noticing that,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.960]   and sometimes you take a picture
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.520]   and one eye got the red eye reflex and the other one didn't,
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.180]   and sometimes people notice that their kid's eyes
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.680]   are sort of turning in, it seems like too much.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.200]   Sometimes there's what's called pseudostrobismus,
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.360]   which is where actually, depending on your anatomy,
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.300]   if you have a little extra skin
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.280]   sort of on the inside corners of your eyes,
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.620]   it makes your eyes look turned in
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.880]   when actually they're straight.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.880]   But if your eyes are actually turned in,
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.020]   or slightly less common in children,
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.940]   more common in adults, misalignment turned out,
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.360]   it's really important to correct that early.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.240]   And the reason is, as you were saying,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.960]   the brain starts ignoring, it fails to fully develop
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.680]   the strong connections for the data coming in
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.600]   from one of those two eyes into the brain.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.160]   And if you pass certain sort of thresholds
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.440]   during development, during childhood,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.880]   without correcting that connectivity,
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.980]   getting those two eyes to work together properly,
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.160]   you can permanently lose that.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   And so we used to use very sort of gross numbers
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.740]   like it's fully correctable
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.160]   if you can intervene before age three,
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.880]   it's partly correctable if you can intervene before age six,
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.520]   you got a chance before age nine,
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.600]   but it turns out in follow-on studies
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.320]   that even kids into their young teens
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.200]   have a shot at correcting that eye-brain connection,
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.520]   that amblyopia, that loss of vision
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.840]   that can occur during early development.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.280]   So even if you're only unfortunately detecting that
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.680]   later on in childhood or even sort of the tween years
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.280]   or early teen years, it's still worth a try
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.280]   to really push to retrain the weaker eye
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.240]   and then also realign the muscles
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.720]   so that they can work together to keep the eyes focused.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.280]   I'll tell you, it's interesting,
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.220]   and there's a lot more to learn about brain plasticity
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.200]   and probably a lot of really cool new therapies
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.400]   yet to discover that could reopen
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.360]   what's called critical period plasticity,
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   this plasticity that we have during development
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.480]   that kind of goes away as we age.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.720]   And that critical period plasticity, as you know,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.440]   has been the best studied actually in the visual system.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   And the idea that we could reopen that is really fantastic.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.560]   But for different parts of that eye-brain connection,
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.240]   there's different periods for critical period plasticity.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.500]   For example, even if you get the amblyopic eye
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.320]   to see well again and then you realign the eyes
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.000]   and now they're working together,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.660]   a lot of kids will never recover full depth perception,
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.440]   stereopsis, the use of two eyes to see depth, for example.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.320]   So why that part of the brain doesn't correct
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.120]   as well as the visual acuity
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.400]   or central vision part of the brain,
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.080]   I'm not sure if we understand that yet.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.080]   - I'm going to ask for a curbside consult
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.120]   as it's sometimes called right now by telling you a story.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.720]   When I was a kid, I went swimming without goggles
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.240]   and I had one eye closed and the other eye open
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.980]   and closing as it went in and out of the water
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.760]   because I'm a deficient swimmer
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.200]   and I only breathed to one side
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.900]   unless I really consciously forced myself
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.000]   to breathe to both sides in a freestyle swim.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.180]   Got out of the pool and I was seeing double.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:23.040]   It was pretty eerie and then it became downright scary
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.280]   because I didn't recover my double vision
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.040]   until they patched one of the eyes,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.240]   forcing me to use the other eye
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.660]   that had been closed the entire time.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.880]   And fortunately this was done early enough
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.040]   and I was young enough that within,
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.620]   I think it was about a day or so,
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.360]   I restored normal vision.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.920]   However, my depth perception is terrible.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.100]   I'm the kid that fly ball was hit to me in the outfield
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.560]   and it's coming and then it hit me.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.980]   This is why I've generally focused on foot sports
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:54.860]   throughout my entire life
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.920]   as opposed to precise hand-eye coordination.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.920]   I'm better at throwing darts and things with one eye closed
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.800]   than I ever would be with both eyes.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.260]   Maybe that's true for most people.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:09.180]   Question I have is, is it true that even just a few hours
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.260]   of misalignment of information to the two eyes
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.680]   early in development can permanently rewire the brain
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.500]   unless there are some corrective measures
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.340]   such as patching up one eye?
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.520]   And the example I gave is just one,
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   but for instance, if someone gets a scratch on their cornea
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.300]   and they patch the eye
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.500]   and the person happens to be 10 years old,
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.300]   is it important to then patch the other healthy eye
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.280]   after the scratched eye is feeling better?
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.080]   In other words, how critical is it to ensure
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.160]   the balance of information coming into the two eyes
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.400]   even on the order of hours or days?
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   - Yeah, your story has some features of totally usual
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.880]   how we think about misaligned eyes leading to amblyopia
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.420]   where one eye is weaker,
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.400]   patching the strong eyes so the weak eye can recover,
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.560]   but not necessarily fully regaining depth perception.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.400]   And so that part of it is quite stereotypical.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.720]   The part of your story that's atypical
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   is that for most kids, an hour or two, let alone minutes,
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.240]   an hour or two, even an hour or two a day,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.160]   if you were, I don't know, if you were a young kid
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.240]   and you just really were training up on throwing darts
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.840]   and you were just keeping one eye closed to throw the darts,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.280]   you know, really practicing for an hour a day,
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.060]   it'd be very unusual for that to trigger
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.140]   this kind of either strabismus misalignment of the eyes,
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.960]   let alone amblyopia.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.320]   And the strabismus is what's giving you the double vision
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.520]   'cause they're misaligned,
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.060]   let alone the amblyopia of one eye turning out weaker.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.560]   If I had to guess, of course, not having, you know,
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.020]   done your exam before that fateful day in the swimming pool,
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.280]   if I had to guess, I would guess that you may have had
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.560]   some intermittent strabismus
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.640]   and your brain was already getting kind of hit
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.960]   and neither you nor your parents may have even noticed it.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.120]   It could be happening, you know, at other times a day
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.140]   or you're not kind of really paying attention.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.700]   It doesn't kind of stand out in the way that,
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.920]   that that day that you got out of the swimming pool,
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.020]   you really noticed it.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.300]   And it may not have been that strong.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.920]   It may have been quite intermittent.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.540]   But if you had had some years of intermittent esotropia
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.700]   or turning in of the eyes or exotropia turning out
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.860]   of the eyes, that just happened here and there,
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.860]   but was accumulating sort of damage or failure to connect
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.200]   over years leading up to that day in the swimming pool.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.020]   And that day just tipped you over the edge
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.300]   and you've got double vision, you really noticed it.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.220]   That led to an eye exam at an eye care provider
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.260]   and they said, "Wait a second, this eye is stronger,
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.380]   "this eye is weaker.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.700]   "You've got a little amblyopia.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.400]   "We're gonna start patching your strong eye
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.180]   "so you can get your weak eye back."
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.840]   So for 99.9% of the kids who like, you know, yeah,
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.420]   they get a little corneal scratch
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.700]   or they're patching one eye closed or, you know,
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.360]   anything that's sort of a rare event like that,
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.620]   nothing to worry about.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.980]   Parents don't have to worry.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.580]   Kids can be kids, they can play,
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.000]   they can do that kind of thing and not have to worry.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.780]   And it's unfortunate that we can't tell in advance
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.980]   which kid's been having the intermittent amblyopia
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.020]   because we don't do a standard eye exam
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.340]   on every five-year-old who's not complaining of anything.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.520]   But yeah, so that's an unusual case in yours.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.700]   And if I had to guess, I would bet that you were having
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.700]   some sort of subclinical, untracked, uncharted, unnoticed,
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.660]   maybe strabismus leading up to that point.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.700]   - Okay, great, thank you.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.420]   You can send me a bill at the end.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:41.980]   Along those lines, I'm 47 years old,
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.100]   so I was part of the generation that grew up
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.540]   with some computers in the classroom, but not a lot.
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.540]   Nowadays, kids from a very young age
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.420]   are looking at iPads and phones and screens
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.140]   and things very close up.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.060]   And there is a wealth of experimental animal data
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:06.060]   showing that if you limit vision to just close range,
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.140]   that the eyeball lengthens,
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.340]   and therefore the visual image falls in front of
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.860]   and not directly onto the neural retina,
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.660]   essentially the light sensing portion of the eye,
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.100]   and those animals become myopic or nearsighted.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.700]   What can we say about the environmental conditions
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.540]   in which kids are seeing from the time they're born
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.060]   through, let's say, adolescence and their teen years
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.420]   in terms of how their visual system wires up?
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.540]   And are there any recommendations that are coming
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.060]   from the scientific literature, clinical studies,
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.260]   clinical trials, excuse me, or otherwise,
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.260]   that indicate what a healthy visual environment consists of?
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.740]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a great question.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.260]   And actually, it's really relevant these days
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.160]   because myopia is so common.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:07.700]   It's more common in Asian populations.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.260]   It's called an epidemic in China.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.340]   In California, we have a lot of Asian heritage
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.700]   or Asian Americans, and so we see a lot,
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.700]   like at Stanford, we see a lot of myopia in kids and adults.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.300]   And really starting to get thoughtful
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.500]   on the science of myopia control.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.320]   How do we provide the right environments?
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.040]   Now, what's interesting is that for decades,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.860]   the assumption, some of the data,
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.100]   really led us to the path of thinking like,
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.260]   gosh, the more you spend at near activities,
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.860]   and these are mouse model experiments like you described,
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.440]   but also well-designed human cohort studies,
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.420]   figuring out, like, asking kids and families,
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.420]   like how long is your kid reading or in front of the computer
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.140]   how myopic are they, how nearsighted are they,
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.660]   versus how much time is your kid in front of the computer
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.860]   doing near work, how myopic or nearsighted are they?
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.700]   And these well-designed cohort studies
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.780]   did point towards this concept
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.140]   that if you do too much near work as a kid,
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.860]   that you're more likely to develop nearsightedness
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.420]   as you get through those sort of preteen
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.980]   and even into the teen years,
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.500]   which is when most of that myopia progression
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.400]   or eyeball elongation is actually happening
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.700]   to cause nearsightedness.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.940]   It's only been in the last few years
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.460]   that some really exciting studies
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.500]   have actually pointed in a slightly different direction,
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.020]   and that's that maybe it's not all,
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.380]   not to say it's not about near activity,
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.280]   but maybe it's not all about near activity.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.480]   Maybe it's actually a little more about
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.500]   the kind of light we're getting into our eyes,
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.240]   and I think you've talked about this before,
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.780]   and it's really important.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.620]   When they've now studied and asked the kids,
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.900]   instead of just how much near
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.720]   and how much far are you doing,
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.520]   how much time are you spending indoors in indoor lighting,
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.240]   which doesn't have full spectrum light
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.000]   in a typical indoor environment,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.780]   versus how much time are you spending outdoors,
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.020]   playing in the yard?
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.340]   You could be reading outside,
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.160]   but what kind of time are you spending outside?
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.480]   And of course, when you're outside in sunlight,
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.880]   even it's in direct sunlight,
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.540]   you're getting a different spectrum
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.500]   of kind of full spectrum lighting from the sun.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.360]   And it looks like it's pretty clear now, actually,
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.360]   that it has maybe more to do with outdoor lighting time
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.940]   than just near work.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.420]   And so I think that we've actually already seen
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.360]   the first couple randomized controlled trials,
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.760]   where they're having kids intentionally
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.100]   spending time outdoors versus sort of standard life,
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.780]   which is gonna be often much more indoor time.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.580]   And seeing some effects,
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.440]   you follow those kids over a couple of years,
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.120]   and the kids who spend time outdoors
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.760]   are progressing in their nearsightedness less.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.320]   Like their nearsighted prescription
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.260]   is not getting as strong
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.560]   as the kids who are spending more time indoors.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.440]   And there's some pretty good biology
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.860]   that's getting worked out, going back to animal models,
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.520]   more about how that might be working in the retina
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.160]   inside the eye, but it's pretty compelling concept.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:25.120]   And so as a parent, you may wanna be telling your kid,
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.860]   like, okay, yeah, I want you to read that book,
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.420]   or if your kid's playing on the phone or something like that
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.020]   or the iPad or something like that,
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.600]   they're allowed that time.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.860]   Okay, you can have that time,
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.440]   but I want you to spend some of the time
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.140]   that you're doing that outdoors.
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.200]   - Are there any thresholds for the amount of time
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.880]   that one would suggest their child be outdoors
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.440]   to get that full spectrum light?
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.760]   - That's a great question.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.240]   We talk about cohort studies
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.140]   where we just ask people what are they doing,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.680]   and there seems to be a little bit
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.920]   of what we would call a dose dependent response,
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.340]   maybe the more time outdoors might be better.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.760]   We don't know if there's an upper limit,
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.840]   like, gosh, if you go over two or three hours,
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.940]   there's no additional benefit.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.640]   Talk about that in cohort studies.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.960]   The real gold standard for answering these kinds of questions
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.760]   are randomized controlled trials
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.800]   and specifically placebo controlled
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.200]   or a control group that's not getting the intervention.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.600]   That's our highest level of evidence for clinical evidence
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.700]   for any of this kind of science
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.960]   when we're talking about humans
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.600]   or preclinical models in the laboratory.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.560]   And the study that hasn't been done yet
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.480]   to really answer that question is to randomize kids
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.320]   to telling this group of kids,
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.120]   you just do your normal life.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.960]   Tell this group of kids, we want you outside an hour.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.880]   This group of kids, we want you outside two hours a day.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.840]   This group of kids, three hours a day.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.100]   And see between the groups, is there a big difference?
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.960]   Like we have pretty good evidence now
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.480]   from the studies that have been done
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.020]   that the difference between zero and one or two hours
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.480]   is clearly there.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.020]   Is five minutes enough?
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.600]   Is five hours better?
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.960]   I don't think we know the answers to those questions yet,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.220]   like what's the right dose,
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.840]   but there's probably at least some dose dependence to that.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.760]   And I can imagine it's a little bit hard
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.160]   to tease apart the near far viewing from the indoor outdoor,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.780]   because yes, of course,
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.640]   a child could be outside on an iPad up close,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.360]   but it's hard to imagine that at some point
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.040]   they aren't seeing off into the distance,
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.680]   far viewing as it's called.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.200]   And the reverse is also true.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.180]   If you're indoors, unless you live in a very,
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.400]   very large home or you're staring off a balcony,
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.580]   far viewing is much harder to achieve.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.920]   And perhaps it isn't important to isolate these variables,
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.640]   although I can see the challenge in developing
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.200]   a really good clinical trial,
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.000]   randomized clinical trial for this.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.720]   Meanwhile, I'll go into the grave shouting,
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.920]   or saying rather,
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.840]   and suggesting that people get some morning sunlight
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.800]   in their eyes to set their circadian rhythm,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.200]   but far viewing at least a few minutes
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.240]   and ideally hours per day,
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.640]   or a mixture of near and far viewing by being outdoors
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.860]   just seems like a good thing to do regardless of age.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.520]   So are there any data in older people,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.360]   not necessarily elderly, but older people?
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.220]   So people when they're from say 25 years of age
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.800]   into their sixties or seventies that getting outdoors
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.560]   and getting this full spectrum light is healthy for the eye
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.300]   in ways that are separate from the known healthy effects
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.220]   of doing that on circadian rhythm setting.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.740]   The circadian part's pretty clear.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.720]   The, in most patient, in most people,
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.960]   the development of nearsightedness happens a lot
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.380]   until age 10, little more through age 20,
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.460]   little more than that into the,
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.100]   you know, in through the twenties up to 30,
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.780]   tiny bit in the thirties up to 40,
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.540]   but usually by those later ages,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.440]   your prescription might be changing a quarter of a diopter.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.480]   That's the measurement that we use when we, you know,
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.560]   give you your glasses prescription,
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.060]   a quarter of a diopter, half a diopter.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.260]   It could get a half diopter more nearsighted
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.100]   or less nearsighted, you know,
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.120]   once you're aging into your forties, fifties and beyond.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.860]   So most of the action on nearsightedness development
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.840]   is actually really happening in the younger ages.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.080]   So again, the premise of intervening in an older person,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.440]   and I'll just include you and me in older people
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.840]   for the sake of this definition,
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.200]   as much as I'm reticent to do that in general.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.140]   I think the premise of sort of light modulation
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.700]   for nearsightedness in older people
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.980]   is probably not so strong.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.720]   I think there are a lot of other benefits.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.760]   You've talked a lot about circadian rhythm.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.680]   There are so many health benefits to exercise.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.080]   And you know, if you're getting outdoors,
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.320]   there's a good chance you're gonna be walking or bicycling,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.620]   you know, so exercise value for the health of our eyes
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.720]   and the rest of our body is clearly there.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.500]   But I don't know that there's really a strong premise
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.460]   that you're gonna change your glasses prescription,
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.400]   you know, in our forties or fifties or beyond.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.920]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.840]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.280]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.660]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.560]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.240]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.460]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.040]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.120]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   once or usually twice a day
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.040]   is that it gets me the probiotics
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.720]   that I need for gut health.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.820]   Our gut is very important.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.360]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.120]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.520]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.160]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.020]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.860]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.420]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.320]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.200]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.660]   nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.120]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.520]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.480]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.800]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.080]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.380]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.780]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.480]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.840]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.880]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.640]   It's probably worth touching on some of the dos
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.600]   and some of the don'ts for eye health generally.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.560]   And then I promise I'm going to get us back
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.360]   to adult eye exams 'cause I have a lot of questions
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.200]   about that.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.160]   I can imagine that it's probably not a great idea
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.360]   to be exposed to extremely bright light
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.020]   and this is why people who weld wear eye shields.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.220]   But of course, most people are not welding.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.820]   What other sorts of environmental conditions
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.780]   are detrimental to our vision health across the lifespan,
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.200]   including brightness of light?
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.580]   We talked a little bit about near far.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.720]   Obviously, we want to keep toxins and acids and solvents
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.460]   and things out of the eye, but what do you see?
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.940]   I'm not gonna say, hopefully not commonly,
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.040]   but what are some of the things that you feel
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.680]   might not be discussed enough in terms of eye health?
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.620]   - Yeah, you know, I think at all ages,
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.300]   eye safety is something that we don't talk about enough.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:19.080]   You know, our eyes are delicate.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.380]   The front surface of the eye, the cornea,
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.000]   the clear window that lets the light go into your eye,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.840]   that's a delicate, very sensitive structure.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.560]   It's thin, maybe a millimeter at the thickest,
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.100]   a half millimeter in the center of our eye.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.880]   The retina is, it's neural tissue.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.720]   This is like really an outgrowth of the brain.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.000]   This is very sensitive.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.720]   It's subject to degenerative disease and injury.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.760]   Our eyes, even if they just get hit, can get very inflamed.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.720]   Our eyes can be more inflammatory than a bruise on our skin,
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.520]   on our shoulder might be.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.040]   So eye safety is a big one.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   And people who are working in certain industries,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   you know, anyone who's doing any metal grinding,
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.100]   people who are even just gardening, you know,
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.220]   and if you're doing some significant gardening and cutting,
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.560]   and you could, you know, fleck a little bit of dirt,
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.360]   and there's a lot of, there's a lot of, for example,
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.880]   fungus that lives in the ground, natural stuff.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.380]   It's all very normal in the earth.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.960]   But you know, our eyes aren't really made
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.720]   to absorb that fungus and have a piece of dirt
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.800]   kind of stick in our eye like that.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.320]   And so people are at risk, I think, for, you know, for not,
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.320]   and we see too much kind of really unnecessary eye injury,
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.960]   eye trauma that if people wore either their glasses,
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.040]   'cause they happen to wear prescription glasses or goggles,
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.200]   or for more advanced work, you know, safety goggles,
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.000]   of course, if you're sanding, doing woodshop projects,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.960]   anything like that, sawing, including, you know, again,
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.920]   in the garden cutting things.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.580]   You know, I think eye safety, you know,
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.440]   eye trauma is a big one.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.000]   And, you know, we probably see one or two,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.760]   what we call open globes a week come into the opera,
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.900]   into the emergency room.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.520]   And, you know, those are tough because, you know, again,
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.680]   the eye's delicate and it can do a lot of healing,
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.640]   but not infinite, right?
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.840]   And so we really, you know, that's one that I think
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.760]   is really an untapped opportunity
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.760]   is just a little more education around eye protection,
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.040]   protecting against eye trauma.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.600]   - What about eye cleanliness?
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.480]   There's some pretty dramatic videos also.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.080]   I've put some of these on my Instagram handle.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.680]   These are MRIs of people rubbing their eyeballs
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.760]   and people really getting a sense of, first of all,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.800]   a restatement of what you said,
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.480]   getting a real sense of just how much the eyes
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.080]   are an outgrowth of the brain,
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.520]   'cause of the one you see with the optic nerves
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.840]   and all their beauty and the eyeballs moving around
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.680]   as someone rubs their eyes.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.960]   I have to imagine that rubbing your eyeballs
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.840]   a little bit isn't bad, but I actually called you.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.600]   I don't know if you remember when I was a junior professor,
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.840]   I woke up from a nap one day and I couldn't see out of one
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.280]   eye, I was freaking out.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.200]   So of course I called you and I had pressure blinded myself
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.640]   by falling asleep on my hand or something like that.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.520]   And you assured me that my vision would come back
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.580]   and indeed it did.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.520]   So you played dual role of ophthalmologist
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.600]   and psychiatrist, thank you.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.380]   And indeed I can see out of both eyes now.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:28.440]   But rubbing our eyes, getting gunk in our eyes,
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.740]   I think unless somebody has lost their vision temporarily,
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.720]   it's hard to imagine this is like a big deal,
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.640]   but when it happens, it is truly frightening.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.340]   We're so dependent on vision.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.680]   So what are your recommendations about rubbing
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.480]   or not rubbing eyeballs about hand washing and cleanliness?
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.120]   And also how do you wash an eye properly?
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.760]   Do you use soap and flush it with water?
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.000]   Or do you just flush it with water?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.880]   Or should you not even do that?
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.820]   Should you use saline?
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.800]   I didn't realize these might sound like low level questions,
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.460]   but these are the things that people deal with
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.240]   on an all too frequent basis.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   - Yeah, you know, for most people, most of the time,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.580]   actually the eyes are a very good, clean environment.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:10.300]   And actually our tears contain enzymes
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.440]   that help break down bacteria and bacterial toxins.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.280]   And so for most people, regular eye washing
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.080]   doesn't have to be any part of their standard routine.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.580]   In terms of the surface of the eye, the part of your eye,
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.780]   the conjunctiva over the whites of the eyes,
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.120]   underneath the eyelids, anything underneath the eyelids,
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.540]   it's pretty self-cleaning.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.760]   And actually our tear production and blinking
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.680]   is very good at keeping our eyes clean.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.880]   The eyelids, eyelashes can be another story.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.320]   And especially as we age, we can, you know,
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.760]   like our skin is breaking down a little differently
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.280]   than when we were younger,
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.260]   you can develop what we sort of nicknamed scurf,
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.480]   which is like kind of little dead skin bits
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.660]   that accumulate around the eyelashes.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.360]   A lot of people develop what we call blepharitis,
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.520]   which is just, just means inflammation of the eyelashes.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.560]   Yeah, and for that, doing some eye scrubs is a good idea.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.640]   They actually sell little pads that you can buy,
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.280]   kind of a little that you rip open
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.520]   and you can use to kind of lightly clean the eyelashes.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.940]   But you can also just use like a No More Tears baby shampoo.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.160]   Just pump a little bit into the palm of your hand
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.060]   once or twice a day.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.040]   Let a little, dilute it with a little water
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   and under the sink and either with your finger
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.740]   or an edge of a washcloth,
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.740]   just very lightly rub the eyelashes.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.580]   What I like to do-
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.540]   - With the eyes closed.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.520]   - With the eyes closed.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.980]   And don't scrunch them closed too tight
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.480]   because you're actually burying the eyelashes
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.200]   when you do the roots of the eyelashes
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.520]   when you really scrunch those.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.280]   So just gently close your eyes,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.200]   just, you know, real gentle closure.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.460]   And then just lightly scrub.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.680]   It shouldn't be abrasive.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.280]   You're not trying to exfoliate the eyelids
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.040]   or eyelashes in any way.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.560]   Just lightly rub with that kind of dilute
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.160]   No More Tears baby shampoo.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.120]   And that can really help people with their eye comfort.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.800]   If you feel like you've got something in your eye,
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.240]   your ideal eye wash is actually going to be
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.320]   a sterile saline solution, a saltwater solution that,
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.940]   you know, they sell little bottles over the counter
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.120]   eye wash solutions like that.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.600]   A lot of people wear contacts
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.460]   will have that kind of eye wash solution,
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.320]   just a sterile saline eye wash, just pure saltwater.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.100]   It doesn't have to have any other chemicals
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.700]   or preservatives in it.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.080]   You can of course use-
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.960]   - Not actual seawater or saltwater.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.400]   - Not saltwater, thank you.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.640]   Yeah, not saltwater out of your salt pool,
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.740]   not saltwater out of the ocean,
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:37.280]   but like a saline saltwater that's available in a sterile.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.960]   Now you can also just use artificial teardrops
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.940]   and some of those come in non-preservative,
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.000]   some of those come in preserved versions.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.040]   Those are all also completely safe to use in the eye.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.100]   And there you can, you know,
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.300]   you can sort of spritz into your eye, you know,
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.900]   hold a lid open and give it a little spritz.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.720]   If you feel like you've got something in your eye,
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.480]   a piece of dirt or a lash that's not coming out,
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.320]   just to rinse it.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.160]   But having like a regular routine, you know,
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.480]   you're not going to hurt anything
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.160]   with the occasional eye rubbing.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.580]   We all do these things just kind of as a, you know,
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.040]   even a nervous habit or just absentmindedly, you know,
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.860]   you might, you know, scratch your arm or rub your eyes
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.700]   or things like that.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.360]   That's fine, you're not going to hurt anything.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.440]   There are conditions where people sort of develop
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.160]   kind of a, almost like a psychological habit.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.620]   There are certain conditions where people actually do
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.580]   too much eye rubbing.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.600]   It can be dangerous if you're in that group,
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.980]   but for the regular run of the mill,
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.820]   everyday occasional eye rubbing, fine.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.580]   If you certainly, if you get a lash in there
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.660]   and you're trying to rub it and blink it and tear it out.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.620]   And again, in that situation,
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.500]   you can use some artificial tears, wedding drops,
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.840]   saline drops, those would be the way to do it.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.420]   - What an incredible tissue.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.980]   The way you describe it, you know,
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.860]   the self-cleaning and yet so delicate,
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.220]   a piece of the brain literally lining the back
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.620]   of each of our eyes, like a pie crust.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:02.700]   I mean, it's a really remarkable biological system.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.340]   Of course, I don't have to tell you that.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.240]   It's just, it never ceases to amaze me.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.820]   Let's talk about eye exams in adults.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.460]   So people are aware presumably
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.100]   that they're optometrists and ophthalmologists.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.480]   I think it's important that we define their different
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.660]   and also overlapping roles.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.820]   And for those that, you know, are past high school age,
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.140]   probably not getting eye exams
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.900]   unless they're sensing a problem,
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.020]   perhaps not even with blurry vision or difficulty
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.060]   seeing at a distance,
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.580]   but sometimes just what feels like fatigue of the eyes
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.480]   or a hard time maintaining alignment of the eyes.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.020]   So how often do you recommend people get eye exams?
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.300]   What is a true regular eye exam?
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.900]   And is it important that people go to an ophthalmologist
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.860]   or will an optometrist suffice?
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.920]   Typically optometrists are a little bit easier
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.420]   for most people to access because there's usually one
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.060]   someplace near an eyeglass store.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.340]   So what are their roles?
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.020]   How often should we get our eyes checked?
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.220]   - Yeah, optometrists and ophthalmologists
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:09.220]   do have very overlapping roles in being eye care providers.
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:13.060]   There are something over 40 or 50,000 optometrists
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.040]   in the United States.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.500]   There's somewhere around 20,000 ophthalmologists
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.780]   in the United States.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.300]   Optometrists get an optometry degree.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.220]   They often have OD after their name.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.300]   Ophthalmologists usually went, you know,
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.420]   went to medical school.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.140]   So they either have an MD after their name
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.960]   or they kind of a DO version of a medical degree.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.860]   And then optometrists will have done additional
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.540]   clinical training in that area,
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.560]   in their area of eye care provision.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.800]   Ophthalmologists, MD, doctor ophthalmologists,
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.380]   eye care providers, in addition to that training,
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.200]   will have done surgical training in ophthalmology.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.080]   Now, there's a lot of overlap.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.980]   And in both scenarios,
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.140]   you can be getting your sort of general exam taken care of,
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.300]   maybe a screening exam.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.380]   I think that there's been a traditional differentiation
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.280]   between optometrists and ophthalmologists,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.500]   with optometrists providing a little more
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:16.860]   of the primary care, eye screening,
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:21.860]   maybe managing early disease, common diseases as well,
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.560]   with more advanced disease often sort of upgrading
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:30.040]   to perhaps specialist ophthalmologists in those areas.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.400]   But that distinction has been declining over time.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.540]   It's still true that in, I think most, if not all states,
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.540]   only the MD ophthalmologists surgeons can do eye surgeries,
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:47.540]   but both groups of eye care providers can diagnose,
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.880]   both can prescribe appropriate eye drop treatments,
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.940]   including prescription eye drop treatments
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.480]   for many of our diseases, eye diseases.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:03.800]   And in some states, optometrists have successfully lobbied
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.460]   for sort of expanded rights of providing eye care.
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:13.460]   And again, access to care for the regular person,
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.620]   wherever they may live, is the most important element.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.340]   And so being able to access eye care,
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.260]   whether it's with an optometrist in your community
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.520]   or an ophthalmologist that may be in your community,
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.820]   or maybe at a distance, I think that's the,
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.320]   the really important thing is to access care.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.060]   Now, kind of like we were talking about with kids,
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:37.860]   if you're in your teens, 20s, maybe even 30s,
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.020]   and not having any problem, you've got no complaints,
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.680]   you can see a distance, you can see it near,
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.420]   so you can read without glasses,
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.420]   you can drive without glasses,
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.100]   you're not having any eye pains,
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.000]   pains around the eyes, redness of the eyes,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.220]   you may never present to an eye care provider
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.980]   through the first four decades of life.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.620]   And almost all the time, it's gonna be okay, right?
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.140]   If you're not symptomatic,
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.060]   the chance you've got some terrible lurking disease in there
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.080]   is low.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.060]   But we do wish that we had a little more screening going on
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.980]   because there are some diseases.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.660]   Glaucoma, for example, my specialty,
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:28.380]   the two main risk factors for glaucoma are increasing age,
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.500]   and it usually presents, you know, in most cases,
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.660]   actually after age 40, but also increasing eye pressure.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.820]   And if your eye pressure is too high, you can't feel that,
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:39.420]   that won't feel funny to you
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.060]   if it sort of slowly has crept up over the years.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.180]   And so from a screening perspective,
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:48.240]   it is good to get some kind of screening exam,
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.080]   could be at a public health fair,
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.760]   could be that you go into the local optometrist,
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   just say, "Hey, I've never been checked.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.000]   I'd like to be checked once, make sure everything's good."
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.380]   - Could you ask for, sorry to interrupt,
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.640]   but could somebody say, "I'd like my pressures checked."
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.900]   As I recall at the optometrist,
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.740]   they're gonna do a puff test, so they're gonna blast some air
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:08.220]   get a sense of how rigid or soft,
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.180]   again, using a nonclinical, non-technical language here,
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.420]   that the eyeball happens to be.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.260]   Right now, by the way,
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.060]   I'm sure there are several hundreds of thousands of people
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.620]   who are with eyes closed,
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.820]   touching the sides of their eyeballs.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.940]   And I'm only half joking, please don't do this folks.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.340]   I'm giving the conversation we just had
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.760]   about eye cleanliness and eye rubbing.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.140]   But my understanding is that the old fact,
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.800]   truly old fashioned eye pressure exam,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.960]   was you would close your eyes
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.120]   and the ophthalmologist would gently press
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.460]   to see whether or not your eyes
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.480]   were more rigid than last time.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.320]   Is that right?
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.380]   - Yeah, that's called belotment.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.780]   And you can kind of just take one second
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.420]   if you're listening and press on your eyes,
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.440]   just very lightly.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.740]   And there's a little give,
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.380]   of course the eyelid's part of that give,
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.200]   but it's not like rock hard.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.000]   And if we press and it feels under the eyelid,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.700]   like gosh, something under there is rock hard,
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.060]   then we know something is wrong.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.380]   That is way too high pressure if it's rock hard.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.220]   But I'll tell you,
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.140]   our ability to differentiate the fine points of eye pressure
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:11.060]   other than rock hard or not rock hard is pretty limited.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:15.180]   So yeah, the optometrist office or the ophthalmologist office
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.820]   as part of a comprehensive screening exam,
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.620]   they'll check the eye pressure,
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.400]   they'll look at the surface of your eyes,
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.980]   make sure everything's looking healthy there,
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.880]   including the eyelids and lashes.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.260]   And they'll look inside the eye
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.300]   and be able to screen for these diseases that way too.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.940]   In addition to checking if you're complaining of any,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.460]   you know, blurriness at distance or at near.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:38.140]   Now, after age 40 or so,
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.520]   a lot of people will present to an eye care provider
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.820]   because we all get what's called presbyopia.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.820]   And presbyopia just translates to a vision of the aged.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:54.280]   So, you know, myopia is our word for nearsighted.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.680]   Hyperopia is farsighted.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.200]   Actually, emetropia means normal sighted.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.560]   So I can see at distance without any glasses, I'm emetropic.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.280]   But then we all get presbyopia.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.780]   And as we age, the lens inside our eye
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:14.660]   that's helping focus light onto our retina gets stiffer.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.340]   Such that our eye muscles are no longer able to relax
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.180]   and reshape that lens.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.740]   And we're not as good as we age
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.600]   at moving our focus from distance vision.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.460]   Distance vision, by the way,
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.500]   is basically anything three feet or further away.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.420]   You're basically viewing light rays coming from infinity
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.380]   once you're past three feet.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.460]   So three feet or further,
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.780]   being able to focus that into 14 inches or 12 inches,
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.940]   which might be a normal, comfortable reading space for you.
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:50.680]   We lose that ability to flex our lens, relax our lens,
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.660]   refocus our lens from distance to near.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.100]   And most people around age 40,
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.900]   could be a couple of years before,
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.220]   could be five or 10 years later that you notice it,
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.340]   but sort of around that time,
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.400]   you start needing reading glasses.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.660]   You need a little extra,
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.500]   even if you can see fine at distance
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.340]   and don't need prescription glasses for distance,
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.020]   you need a booster, you need reading glasses for near.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.020]   I don't know if you're experiencing this yet.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.200]   - Yeah, I'm really intrigued by this,
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.760]   but maybe you could clarify when you say reading glasses,
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.300]   do you mean just a magnifier?
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:27.180]   Because I use a 0.5 or a 0.75 magnifier for reading,
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.660]   but I try and rely on them as little as possible.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.820]   And I want to get to this about using glasses as a crutch
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.620]   and the problems with that.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.060]   I have a story about that too.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.140]   I seem to, you know, it's no coincidence
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.340]   I decided to work on vision.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.860]   I mean, after all I had a bunch of vision issues
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.760]   that fortunately are corrected.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.860]   But, you know, I do experience, for instance,
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.180]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.140]   if I look at my phone, which by the way, folks,
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.380]   I try and get outside and see sunlight first
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.060]   before ever looking at the phone.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.980]   But I'll notice when I first look at my phone
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.060]   in the morning,
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:03.700]   that I can see it very clearly through my right eye,
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.180]   but that if I cover my right eye,
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.940]   my left eye is extremely blurry
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.780]   to the point where I'm like, oh, I'm calling Jeff.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:09.780]   You know, I'm afraid.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.400]   But then over the course of maybe 10, 15 minutes,
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.300]   it resolves.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.680]   And I don't think it's because something's in my eye.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.080]   I don't think it's pressure of having slept on that side.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.580]   I don't think it's a lubrication of the eye issue.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:26.020]   But the two eyes seem to come into focus, so to speak,
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.020]   at different rates early in the day.
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.020]   And if I pop my readers on, I can see right away.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.460]   So I will use readers late in the day often
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.460]   if I want to read at night or something of that sort.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.920]   It feels so much more relaxing.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.180]   I feel like I can finally relax,
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.620]   whereas otherwise I realize that I'm straining
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:43.740]   in order to see.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.060]   Is there any clinical data in what I just described?
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:51.300]   - Yeah, Andy, I'll tell you my story that's like that.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.800]   And we were living down in San Diego
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.080]   when you and I were both professors at UC San Diego.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   And we had moved into a house and I found a pair of glasses,
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.980]   a pair of reading glasses in a closet.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.920]   And we asked around,
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.480]   did any of the grandparents leave some glasses behind?
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.680]   Nobody seemed to know who they were.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.360]   So we finally just decided like,
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.740]   well, I guess the people who moved out of the house
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.080]   just left a pair of glasses in the back of this closet.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.620]   And then I tried the glasses on
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.320]   and I looked at my phone up close and was just like,
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.300]   oh my God, wait a second.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:34.220]   I didn't realize how blurry my near vision was.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.100]   And this is back, I was about 40, 42, something like that.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   So I didn't even realize until I put on the readers
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:46.660]   and these were 1.25 magnifiers.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.820]   So also mild ones, mild ones.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.420]   And I'll tell you, I got addicted
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.860]   because who doesn't like good vision, right?
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.620]   I mean, oh my God, now I can make the type smaller
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.540]   on my phone.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.180]   I can, you know, it was wonderful.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.460]   - And you can relax a bit.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.520]   I mean, the musculature that's responsible
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.740]   for moving the lens and focusing the eye
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.860]   and then all this extra ocular musculature.
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.220]   And we forgot, I mean, I'm definitely going crow's feet
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.540]   around my eyes, probably 'cause I squint or something,
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.280]   but you know, just the ability to relax one's face.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.380]   It just feels like, you know, more energy, I feel like,
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.500]   can be devoted to what we're actually looking at,
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.080]   not making light of this.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.440]   - Well, pretty soon I just kept that one pair of glasses
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.480]   with me all the time and I would just keep them in a pocket
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.180]   and whip them out whenever I was, you know,
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.200]   working at near using my phone.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.420]   At a little greater distance,
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.020]   like a typical computer distance,
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.460]   I could still see the computer fine.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.880]   So it really started for like kind of that close-up phone.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.160]   It was, I could get into here,
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.600]   but not all the way into here.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.120]   And yeah, and then pretty soon I was just totally addicted.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.960]   And so, you know, then I had to go buy 10 pairs
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.320]   and leave them, one by the bedside table, you know,
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.400]   one in the car, one in the computer bag,
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.400]   one on every desk I work at. - Did you forget any of them?
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.000]   - Yeah, because I'd leave them anywhere and forget them.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.640]   And that way I could just, yeah, exactly, you know, yeah.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   So, yeah, so whether using the readers accelerates
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:24.480]   the progression of dependence on the readers
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.440]   is still not, you know, that's still up for debate.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.200]   You know, some studies say maybe yes,
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.320]   some studies say maybe no,
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.800]   but certainly psychologically we get addicted
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.920]   to good, easy vision.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.520]   And if you don't have to squint
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.400]   and if you're not straining your muscles
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.680]   and all of a sudden the text on your phone
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:48.400]   looks crisper again, boy, that's addictive.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.040]   You're gonna like good vision.
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.520]   And so it feels like you're getting dependent
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.200]   and how much of that is changing the eye muscles
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.040]   and how much of that is just the psychology
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.840]   of wanting to have good vision,
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.080]   I think probably the jury's a little bit out on that point,
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:05.520]   but point being either way, your dependence will grow.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   And as you continue to age 40s, 50s, up until about 60, 65,
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.640]   the ability to shape that lens
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   gets weaker and weaker and weaker.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.720]   And so you need to move from the 0.5s to the 1.0s
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.400]   to the 1.5s and eventually- - To the Coke bottle.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.760]   - Well, thankfully not.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.560]   You eventually max out at about plus 2.5 or plus three
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.680]   because that's the amount of extra refractive power
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.520]   that you need in magnifiers to take the equivalent
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:43.640]   of your infinity viewing and bring it up to 14 inches
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.320]   to read it near basically, you need a plus three
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.520]   and then you don't need any lens,
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.360]   eye muscle action whatsoever.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:57.520]   So you kind of max out around 2.5s or threes.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:01.840]   So because most people will hit this
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.800]   somewhere in their 40s, they're sort of like,
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.360]   "Gosh, I'm having trouble on the phone."
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.360]   I think most people actually use that.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.880]   That's like kind of the first time for a lot of people
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.800]   they're like, "Well, I guess I should go to the eye office."
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.320]   See the optometrist or maybe ophthalmologist.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.720]   And when they go in, they should be getting the standard
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.220]   in either of those offices will be to give you
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:26.680]   a full screening exam, including maybe it's a puff test
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.600]   or a blue light test or a little pen
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:32.080]   that can check your eye pressure and having a look inside
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.720]   and seeing if your retina and optic nerve look healthy.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.600]   It's kind of screening for all the main diseases.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.980]   And so, and they'll tell you at that point,
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:43.120]   "Hey, you'll look great if you feel like your glasses
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.360]   aren't doing it for you in a year or three years come back."
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.560]   Or they might say, "Hey, I've detected something.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.980]   I'm worried about you."
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.360]   And they'll set up a routine for your ongoing eye care.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:57.680]   - Assuming that somebody doesn't have, you know,
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.480]   some form of amblyopia or the need
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.440]   for some really robust corrective lenses
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.520]   and they are already using readers,
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:11.340]   let's say a plus one or so, you know,
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.280]   plus one, plus or minus 0.5 reader.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.380]   Would you recommend based on my experience
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:19.380]   and based on your experience that people strive
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.560]   to avoid using them for as long as they can?
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.640]   Because in some sense, if that's the recommendation,
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.160]   then the recommendation is that people kind of deal
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.960]   with the fact that they're seeing a little less well
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.560]   or a lot less well than they possibly could.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.940]   So I'm assuming that people can still drive well,
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:35.020]   people can still read,
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:36.240]   but it involves a little bit more effort.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.080]   In other words, are we weakening our eyes
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.760]   by using these readers?
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.600]   I realize you said that the data are a little bit mixed,
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.880]   but as long as one can perform
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.020]   their required daily activities,
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:51.760]   would we be better off delaying the use of readers?
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.000]   - There's two important answers to that question.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.920]   One is regarding the lens
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.000]   and the eye muscles that control the lens.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.940]   And it's entirely plausible.
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.940]   That's what I was saying, kind of the data is mixed on,
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:07.840]   but it's plausible that if we would just exercise,
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.040]   like work a little harder,
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.200]   kind of not use as strong a reader as we want
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.300]   or not use that reader as often as we might really enjoy,
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.340]   are we exercising those muscles
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.220]   and kind of exercising the ability
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.580]   to stretch versus relax the lens
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.580]   and kind of slow the progression from the 1.0 reader
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:35.300]   to the 1.25 reader to the 1.5 reader, et cetera, right?
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.500]   And so that's what I was saying.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.540]   The data's mixed, but there's a good premise
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.500]   that maybe if you're exercising.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.460]   But let me give you the, on the other hand,
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.460]   it's probably ideal to give your retina and your brain
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:53.900]   the sharpest visual signals you can.
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:58.900]   So why hamstring your retina and your brain
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:03.000]   and your vision and your enjoyment and ability to read
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.540]   or do near work by constantly undercutting
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:11.180]   the reading glasses or leaving them out,
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:15.220]   or you're not helping the whole back part of yours.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.780]   Maybe you're helping the lens,
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:20.700]   but you're definitely not helping your retina and brain
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:25.060]   by feeding it blurry information all of that time.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:29.760]   So I actually think just give in, use the readers,
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.280]   have your, enjoy your best vision all the time.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:37.120]   And if that means wearing glasses, and by the way,
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.180]   if that means that you're gonna have minus two glasses
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.160]   for vision and you'll eventually need minus two 50s
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.980]   for distance vision, or if you're gonna need readers,
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:51.500]   1.5 readers now, and in a few years, 2.0 readers,
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.440]   okay, so you'll get the next reader.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.400]   It's actually not a big deal.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:58:00.400]   You can, you're not hurting, you're probably helping.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.380]   And in the meantime, it's an enormous enjoyment
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.820]   to actually have good vision all the time, right?
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:08.800]   So I actually counsel people,
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.940]   just wear the glasses that work best for you.
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:14.820]   You know, you're only minimally changing
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.280]   how your prescription's gonna change over time,
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.600]   very minimally.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:21.520]   So just enjoy your best vision,
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.420]   even if it's using readers for close
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:26.140]   or prescription glasses for far.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.920]   - I appreciate that recommendation.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.660]   I do enjoy using the readers at night.
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.580]   It really helps for all the reasons I mentioned before.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.340]   I've noticed that driving at night
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.860]   presents an enormous strain on my visual system.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:41.840]   And I've noticed this for a number of years.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.580]   Are there any, I know there's something called
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.700]   stationary night blindness.
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.020]   I don't think I'm stationary night blind.
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:50.620]   I think the mutation for stationary night blindness
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.660]   was identified in the Calusa horse or something like that.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.580]   These were horses that you could walk up to very easily
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.220]   and they wouldn't even see you until you were right there.
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.180]   Someone's gonna correct me on this, it's the internet.
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:03.340]   But I think that the mutation was identified, et cetera,
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.140]   but I don't think I'm stationary night blind,
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.380]   but I do find that driving at night, I get very fatigued.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.680]   And then I'll sometimes even wear my plus one readers
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:16.540]   when I drive at night, which removes the fatigue,
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.800]   even though I'm looking more or less at a distance.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.520]   Are there some conditions that make it hard
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.180]   for people to see at night
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:24.640]   for which they would want corrective lenses?
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.840]   And what sorts of biology underlies that,
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.140]   assuming that somebody is not stationary night blind
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.500]   or a Calusa, I think is the name of the breed horse?
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.940]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:41.940]   We, for the optical defects in our eyes,
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.700]   most or many of which can be corrected
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.580]   with just having the right prescription lenses,
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.540]   we can get away with it
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:53.580]   without using those corrections in brighter light.
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:58.580]   And so during the daytime, you could be slightly blurry.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.800]   If I have a real bright light and a good high contrast book,
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.360]   you know, with black letters on the white page,
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.580]   I can get away with reading that without my readers.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.100]   Unlike if I'm in dim light, then I feel,
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.700]   and that might be kind of what you're describing
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.720]   if you're reading at night,
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.220]   you actually prefer to use the readers a little more
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.020]   even at night, because we can make up
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.920]   for a lot of that blur if we just have bright enough signal
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.980]   and contrast coming into our eyes.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:27.860]   - Makes sense.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.300]   - Yeah, so when you're driving at night and noticing this,
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:35.540]   this might be revealing a little bit of a need for glasses.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.720]   Now I'm not suggesting this is the answer,
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.980]   but far more common than having congenital stationary
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:45.140]   night blindness would be being what's called
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.260]   a latent hyper rope.
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.820]   Okay, now we talked about already how the lens
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:54.140]   inside our eye goes from focusing at distance
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.080]   to then we squeeze the muscles, the lens actually rounds up
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.380]   and it allows us to focus at near.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:02.680]   Some people's optical system of their eye
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.540]   is actually wired or designed or sort of set up in length,
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.580]   not for regular distance, which would be anywhere
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.340]   from about three feet to infinity,
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.940]   but it's actually designed, it's actually tuned
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.460]   for being beyond infinity,
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.120]   which doesn't make any actual sense when you talk about it,
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.240]   but just the optics of the eye at their best focus
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.360]   are actually focusing the light behind the retina.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.620]   And if you're doing that when you're younger,
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.180]   you're actually using some of your focusing power
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:37.200]   to use those muscles, strain those muscles,
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.900]   relax that lens, round up that lens
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.900]   and have your vision focus from beyond infinity
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.780]   to normal distance, like distance vision.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.460]   And so if you're a latent hyper rope,
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.340]   you are constantly using those muscles.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.460]   And again, if you're tired, it's the end of the day,
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.940]   your muscles are feeling a little fatigued,
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.000]   your latent hyperopia, or by the way,
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.020]   if you've had a drink or two, alcohol can do this too,
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.940]   your latent hyperopia can kind of kick in,
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.360]   especially as we're age and we're not as good
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.900]   at refocusing that lens anyway.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:19.320]   And now all of a sudden, your vision is kind of reverting
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.700]   to its natural state, which is slightly out of focus
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.260]   at distance because it's actually focused beyond infinity,
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.460]   if you will.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.860]   And so all of a sudden you put on that plus one
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.980]   just for a little extra booster kick and you're like,
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.720]   oh yeah, yeah, distance vision is clean and easy now.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.500]   So I'll have to bring you into the clinic to really be sure,
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.920]   but you could be exhibiting a little bit
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.160]   of that kind of latent hyperopia.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.420]   - I definitely want the eye exam and I want it from you.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.820]   And I've been called a lot of things in life
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:52.820]   and we can now add perhaps latent hyperopia to that.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.940]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.620]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.900]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.540]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.020]   to help you better understand your body
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.860]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.660]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.820]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.820]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.420]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.380]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.840]   however, is that they'll give you information
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.980]   about certain lipid markers or hormone markers,
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.060]   but no information about what to do with all of that data.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.420]   Inside Tracker makes it very easy
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:30.900]   to look at your levels of hormones,
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.100]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.500]   and then to assess what sorts of behavioral,
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.920]   nutritional, supplementation,
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.460]   or perhaps other interventions you might want to use
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.740]   to bring those numbers into the ranges
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:44.340]   that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.740]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.300]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.260]   Another piece here, and again,
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.820]   this discussion is not designed to be an eye exam for me,
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.440]   but I have yet another experience
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.340]   that I think illustrates the key importance
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.740]   of both critical period plasticity
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.040]   and the questions about whether or not
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.780]   to rely on corrective lenses.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.220]   And that is from the time I was pretty young,
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.060]   I could make my sister laugh by deviating one eye inward.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.980]   So not crossing my eyes, but moving one eye inward.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.860]   And then what happened was when I was in college
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:25.780]   and studying a lot, a lot and getting very fatigued,
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.820]   I noticed that this eye started
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.740]   just kind of drift in a little bit.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:32.460]   So I went to the campus health center
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.280]   and they gave me a prescription for a prism lens,
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.400]   which of course redirects the image.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.740]   But then I noticed that this eyeball moving inward,
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.360]   and I guess for those of you watching on YouTube
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.720]   and not just listening,
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.960]   I can do this by just moving one eye in.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.680]   All right, so I can move this eye in.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.820]   Yeah, it's a fairly pronounced.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.840]   It started to really drift in at a relaxation state
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.000]   and I started seeing double again.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   So I thought, whoa, this one prism lens
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.040]   is a crutch of the sort that I really don't want.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.240]   Crushed the glasses, it broke them
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.900]   and it never went back to them.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.640]   I have voluntary control over it,
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   but that's one example where the corrective lens
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.160]   can actually create a pretty significant shift
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.480]   in eye position if one relies on it.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.300]   So this gets back to this issue
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.440]   of when should people force themselves
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.920]   to work with their natural vision,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:26.160]   maybe do some more far viewing as opposed,
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.840]   and certainly get outside and get sunlight
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.800]   into the sunlight, full spectrum light,
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.960]   as opposed to relying on corrective lenses.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:36.160]   - Yeah, and you've raised a very important distinction here
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.520]   and that's the distinction between the muscles
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.960]   that are inside our eye that we use to relax
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.520]   and refocus the lens and the muscles
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.640]   that are on the outside of the eyeball,
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.000]   of course, inside our orbit,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.140]   but on the outside of the eyeball that turn the eyes.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.080]   And if everything's working right,
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.200]   keeps our eyes really yoked straight.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.360]   And we talked about earlier this possibility
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.120]   that you may have been having a little bit
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.800]   of intermittent esotropia or intermittent turning
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.400]   in of the eyes that then culminated
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.300]   on that day at the pool when you really noticed it.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.820]   And your ongoing ability to actually turn one eye in
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.200]   could be related to that.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.440]   I remember as a kid standing in front of the mirror
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.520]   and I couldn't get my eyes to cross
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.960]   even though friends could do it.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.200]   And so I was in the losing group
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.820]   on that end of the spectrum.
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.660]   - And you became an ophthalmologist.
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.240]   - And then I became an ophthalmologist.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.080]   - And I must say it is very reassuring
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.440]   that you have excellent vision.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.380]   I always worry when I go to a new dentist
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.980]   and I look up at them in one moment
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.200]   and if they're not wearing a mask
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.240]   that their teeth are not pristine,
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.720]   I think, well, what am I doing here?
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.660]   So an ophthalmologist with excellent vision
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.380]   brings me great comfort.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.520]   - But cobbler's children should have shoes.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.360]   - Right, exactly.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.740]   But yeah, so when to correct,
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.460]   when not to correct with lenses.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.840]   And I realize here we haven't talked at all about contacts.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.000]   We've been talking about eyeglasses.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   - Yeah, let's come to contacts in a sec if you want.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.880]   But yeah, let me return to your question.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:05.680]   The difference between providing corrective lenses
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.600]   that allow you to focus for near or distance
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.040]   in your glasses so that you can go easy
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.480]   on the inside the eye, eye muscle having to work so hard.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.820]   And a lot of people get eye strain
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.360]   and sort of headaches even from that,
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.640]   from not having an adequate correction that they're wearing.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.980]   That's different actually, especially when we're children
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.220]   or again into that, maybe even into the teens
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.320]   and even young adult years.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.740]   From the eye muscles on the outside of the eyes,
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.160]   which are supposed to be yoking our eyes straight
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.800]   and so that you have them both looking
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.160]   at the same point in space.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.640]   And there it's actually quite a common treatment
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:48.420]   to try to under correct and ask people to exercise
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.160]   and not just give a prism that says,
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.680]   "Hey, if your eyes in sometime, we'll use a prism
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.900]   so the light sort of looks right to you."
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.620]   But rather under correct that and sort of really force you
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:04.280]   to exercise trying to yoke your two eyes straight together.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.180]   And so that's in contrast.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:09.140]   And they're actually, I think many optometrists
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.620]   who often specialize in what are the right glasses
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.360]   to give in a situation like that.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.360]   Wherever possible, especially during development,
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.760]   as our bodies are developing,
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.100]   as we're sort of growing in our younger years,
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:29.160]   take the approach of intentionally trying to under correct,
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.820]   not use a prism or not use a full prism correction
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.660]   and to really help.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:39.260]   Sometimes it's also like an accommodative reflex
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.140]   that your eyes are just,
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.620]   you're spending so much time reading it near.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.460]   When you read it near your eyes actually naturally turn in
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.020]   a little bit to focus at that near
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.840]   so that they can be looking at the same word on the page.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.900]   And that can also,
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.120]   if you've got kind of too much muscle drive,
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.880]   you can overshoot that.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.220]   And so sometimes just using not a prism,
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.840]   but like a little bit of a plus lens in kids,
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   just so they don't have to work quite so hard
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.440]   to turn their eyes in and sort of over exercise those muscles.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.140]   These are all great examples where going to
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:13.600]   an eye care provider, often for these kinds of issues,
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.800]   an optometrist is the right first place to start.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.860]   You'd like to say that every optometrist
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.120]   and every ophthalmologist is always going to give
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.140]   the exact right thing for each kid or young adult
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.440]   or older adult to do.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.280]   And we wish all medical care providers
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.180]   were always right on target.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.900]   And a lot of times it's a perfect science,
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.900]   but a lot of times it's an imperfect science.
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:38.120]   And so it could be that at least with,
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.100]   we're now 20, 25, 30 years later,
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:42.820]   but like it could be that today
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:44.980]   that 20 year old version of yourself
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.980]   would have been given a different approach
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.040]   to having one eye intermittently,
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.560]   occasionally turning in like that.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.780]   - Is there any real value to near far exercises,
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.980]   so-called pencil pushups or a smooth pursuit tracking?
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.080]   I've talked a little bit about it before on the podcast,
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.660]   but that was some time ago.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.080]   So what are your thoughts on that?
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.260]   Is there any value whatsoever?
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.820]   I mean, they require a little bit of work,
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.120]   just like going to the gym,
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.440]   but 25 reps a day of near far,
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.300]   especially as one is transitioning from age 30 to age 50,
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.100]   is it worthwhile?
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.740]   Is it harmful in any way?
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.140]   - Definitely not harmful.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.840]   And again, would it slow down
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.300]   or sort of slow down your progression to presbyopia
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.940]   or needing those reading glasses?
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.860]   Could be some people also develop
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:42.000]   sort of a real failure to properly turn their eyes in.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.900]   And so they actually would benefit
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.100]   if you've been diagnosed with that inability,
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.340]   you're having double vision at near, but not at distance.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:55.180]   So that kind of convergence insufficiency, for example.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:58.100]   Then pencil pushups often get prescribed
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.300]   as a way to try to exercise those skills
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.340]   in your eye muscles.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.160]   - I should interrupt here and just tell people,
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.700]   for those of you that are listening, not watching,
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.860]   the pencil pushup,
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.660]   we can put a link to it in the show note captions,
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.660]   but it's essentially taking a pen or pencil,
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.660]   looking at it at arms distance
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.940]   and then slowly moving it toward your nose
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.300]   and deliberately working hard.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.660]   And it is a bit of effort to continue to focus on it
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.680]   at a close distance.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.800]   At some point it will become blurry
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.620]   because I can't cross my eyes any further
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.140]   unless I become a cyclops.
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.540]   And then moving it back out again
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.180]   and doing that for 10 to 25 repetitions,
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:38.620]   maybe once or twice a day, a few times a week.
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.640]   That's what, those are pencil pushups.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:44.900]   So you're certainly not going to hurt anything.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.140]   There are other situations
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.100]   where those really do get prescribed
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.940]   and there's definitely some good clinical trial data
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.480]   suggesting that they can actually help.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.940]   For example, recovery from concussion.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:56.980]   A lot of people actually,
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:01.300]   one of the really telling ways to diagnose concussion,
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:04.300]   and this can be concussion from sports or a fall
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.640]   or any source of concussion,
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.100]   your smooth pursuit, which is the ability,
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.000]   let's say I've got a dot moving around
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.580]   in a circle on a screen
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.900]   and I'm following that dot with my eyes.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.540]   My eyes should be able to very smoothly follow
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.820]   that circle around.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.720]   - It's the little hockey puck on one watching a hockey game.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.500]   Is that, you're a hockey fan, right?
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.340]   - Like that, like that.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.540]   You know, just following a ball,
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.660]   following any movement with smooth pursuits of your eyes.
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.060]   And after concussion, that actually,
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.700]   those systems in our brain,
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.000]   that sort of reflexive ability to properly follow that,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.580]   use that visual input to tell your eye muscles
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:44.540]   exactly where to move, gets disrupted.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.260]   And so all of a sudden your smooth pursuit
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.380]   starts to look choppy.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.780]   It's not so smooth anymore.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.880]   And it's actually a way to diagnose
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.700]   and follow recovery from concussion.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:59.100]   And part of the visual rehab, sort of neuro rehab,
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.260]   one of the approaches being used
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:05.200]   and further studied still in recovery from concussion
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.420]   is actually doing those kinds of exercises
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.800]   like pencil pushups or basically what you've described
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.740]   is focusing from far away to focusing near
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.360]   and doing that back and forth
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.240]   and using that to sort of like help regain
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.140]   the tighter control of our eye movements
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.140]   and that eye brain connection.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.940]   - So if traumatic brain injury causes deficits
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.360]   in smooth pursuit eye movements
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.900]   and some of the recovery protocols for traumatic brain injury
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:35.080]   are to have people do smooth pursuit protocols
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.520]   and pencil pushups,
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.980]   are these also the sorts of things that anyone can just do?
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:44.020]   I mean, whenever possible, we like to share tools
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.920]   for various aspects of health on this podcast,
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.860]   but of course we don't want people cowboying this stuff
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.600]   in a way that could be detrimental to their vision.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.300]   So is it okay to get on YouTube
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:58.780]   and find a smooth pursuit tool?
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.560]   We can put a link to these, there are several of them
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.440]   and people spend a few minutes doing this.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.080]   - Yeah, you're definitely not going to hurt anything.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.900]   So totally fine to do it.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.160]   And some people may notice,
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.400]   like they feel a little more visually active
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.560]   if they do these kinds of exercises.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.280]   I think most people would do them
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.440]   and not notice something in their daily life.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   We actually have made so much progress in research
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.300]   in thinking about how do we take the diseased
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.680]   or dysfunctioning or aging eye
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.500]   and get it back to healthy and normal.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.260]   But there's a whole other area of science
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.240]   that we're really just barely touching.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.240]   We've actually just opened a vision performance center
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.840]   to really get at not just how do we rehab
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.060]   the sick eye back to health,
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.500]   but what's the difference between functioning normally
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.060]   and functioning above normally?
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.920]   For example, athletes,
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.720]   when they get studied for vision characteristics,
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.720]   they have faster visual reflexes, higher visual acuity.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.920]   How much of that was genetic?
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.560]   How much of that is trained?
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560]   We don't really understand.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.040]   Could we train all of us with normal vision
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.320]   to get up to supranormal vision?
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.240]   These are great, important questions
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.280]   that are really relevant to every regular person.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.280]   Of course, people doing e-sports
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.980]   and the gaming communities and athletes
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.200]   is part of what we're studying
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.520]   in the vision performance center,
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.840]   but these are really, really big opportunities
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.600]   to try to understand how do we move people
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.720]   from normal vision to supranormal vision.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.580]   And there's evidence that you can do it.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.360]   So here's a great example.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:56.360]   Some athletes train using these special goggles
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.520]   that actually use electrical signals
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.440]   in the glasses part of the goggles
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.200]   to actually black out your vision,
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:08.440]   one 30th of every second, two 30ths of every second,
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.660]   three 30ths of every second.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.800]   Now imagine you and I are passing a basketball
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.040]   back and forth, except you're wearing goggles.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.760]   And all of a sudden you're only getting 90% of the data
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.000]   of where's that basketball on its way to my hands.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.720]   Now you're only getting 80%.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.120]   Now you're only getting 70% of that visual information.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.080]   And you are practicing, right?
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:33.000]   You are getting good at catching a basketball
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.960]   when you only have a fraction of the visual information.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.240]   And now I put you back on the basketball court
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.240]   without the goggles.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:44.800]   You might be really good at passing that basketball around
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.640]   and catching that basketball, right?
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:49.400]   And so the idea that we could train
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.520]   and understand the biology of training
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.320]   to get the eyes from normal to supranormal performance,
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.040]   I think it's an amazing area
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.600]   and one that we've really just started to dig into.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.840]   - Well, that's fantastic.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.440]   So this is a new program at Stanford
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.640]   through the Department of Ophthalmology.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:07.520]   Is it linked up at all
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.480]   with the Wu Tsai Performance Institute?
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.640]   - Yeah, actually there's been a lot of focus over the years,
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.520]   I think, in human performance.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.880]   And there's actually a new human performance alliance
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.840]   and center.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.400]   We've long had really run
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.360]   through the Department of Orthopedics,
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.180]   a human performance laboratory.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.760]   That's really much more about joints and muscles
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.920]   and strength and conditioning and stretching.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.160]   To layer onto that now,
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.100]   a real understanding of how vision is operating.
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:41.240]   It's interesting.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.380]   Let's go back to the example of concussion.
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.320]   We've got, I don't know,
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.700]   about 800 varsity student athletes
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:49.120]   in all the different sports at Stanford.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:51.560]   And you might have a student athlete come in and say,
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.580]   "You know, something doesn't feel right.
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.780]   "I got a little hit on the head.
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:58.380]   "I feel like my vision is a little bit messed up.
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:01.000]   "Maybe I've got a mild concussion."
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.040]   You could imagine doing some of these tests
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.520]   on some of these performance athletes, for example,
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.640]   and saying, "Well, gosh, you look normal."
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.200]   But actually, they used to be operating
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.420]   at a super normal rate,
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:18.120]   and this is a noticeable decrement for them.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.120]   And so just starting to study and understand
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.780]   what's the difference between normal and super normal,
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.880]   how do we go back and forth between those two?
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.280]   How do we measure that difference?
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.200]   And maybe ultimately, how do we train into that difference?
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.240]   I think it's gonna be exciting.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.680]   And not just for athletes, for regular people.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:36.120]   You talk about driving at night.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.360]   Is there a solution where we could train our eyes
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.960]   to be better at driving at night?
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.200]   And I don't know, maybe reduce the number of accidents
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.960]   that happen out in the world.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.600]   - Well, certainly there's physical training protocols
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.920]   which are redefining what a 60-year-old or a 70-year-old
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.520]   could look like and feel like and be able to perform like.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.820]   Why not do the same for vision?
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.600]   So I don't think there's anything supernatural
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.300]   or greedy about doing it.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.880]   I think that's the excitement of biology
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:07.600]   and neuroplasticity that you can extend it forward
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.560]   as opposed to just trying to wire up correctly
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.080]   during development.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.640]   This is a perfect time for me to ask you a question
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.480]   that I'd love a clear answer on if it's possible.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.500]   It's not always possible,
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:22.560]   which is could you define 2020 vision
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.500]   and a few of the variants
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.700]   so that any person could understand it?
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.700]   So we think of 2020 as perfect vision.
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:31.860]   What does that mean?
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:34.240]   What would degraded vision look like?
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.060]   Whatever those numbers are.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.340]   And then what would above normal,
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.240]   supranormal vision look like?
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.460]   And is it true that fighter pilots have supranormal vision?
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:50.540]   Yeah, that's another population like many athletes
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:54.820]   of people who may have sort of better than normal vision.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:59.520]   2020, we define almost everything we do
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:04.520]   based on kind of a average, not sick human being,
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.860]   adult, whatever it is, right?
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:11.380]   And so 2020 vision means that you can read
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:15.560]   the smallest letters at 20 feet away
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:20.560]   that the average healthy person can read at 20 feet away.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.940]   So you can read at 20 what they can read at 20, okay?
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.700]   Now, if you have worse than 2020 vision,
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.520]   maybe you have 2025 vision, 2040 vision,
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.540]   maybe you have 2200 vision,
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.540]   which on the eye chart at the office
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:39.540]   is like the big E at the very top is 2200 vision.
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:43.860]   That means you can read at 20 feet
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:48.700]   what a normal person could read at 200 feet, right?
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:51.780]   So you've got pretty limited lower vision.
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.620]   We can measure down to like 2400, 2800.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.900]   At that point, we're getting into like, gosh,
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.420]   can you count how many fingers I'm holding up?
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.520]   You know, that kind of thing.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.900]   And then ultimately hand motion.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:05.820]   Can you even tell if my hand is moving
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:08.580]   in this side of your vision or this side of your vision?
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:12.140]   And then ultimately after that light perception,
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:14.900]   can you tell if the room lights are on or off, right?
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:18.740]   And that's kind of the edge of being actually fully blind.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.820]   We call legal blindness in the United States
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.320]   typically 2200 or worse.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.940]   - And is it true that there are people
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:27.380]   who are legally blind that are out there driving
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.900]   as we're having this conversation?
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:33.420]   - I have to imagine that that is unfortunately the case,
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.540]   but it shouldn't be because those people obviously
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.380]   are really severely impaired
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.580]   and that's obviously quite dangerous.
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:42.000]   So that's 2020.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.340]   Now, it gets worse 2040, 2080, 2100.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:47.180]   Can it get better?
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:49.420]   Yeah, it turns out that people can be
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:52.100]   sort of on the other end of that curve.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.740]   And so we could have athletes and fighter pilots
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:59.180]   or people who have had LASIK surgery who are 2015, 2010.
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:04.380]   If you're 2010, that means you can see a 20 feet,
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.180]   what the average person needs to be only 10 feet away
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.500]   to see, right?
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.260]   And so you've got better than normal vision.
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:14.400]   And people do get to that through a variety of ways.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.680]   And so it is possible to have better than 2020 vision.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.080]   - Does the degree of visual acuity,
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.200]   'cause that's really what we're talking about here,
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.340]   differ dramatically between the two eyes?
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.860]   - In most healthy people, no.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:34.000]   Remember we talked about you're born
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.880]   with something like 2200 vision,
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.060]   takes you a couple of years
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:39.000]   and it could be a little bit asymmetric.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.560]   - 2200 vision.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.920]   - Yeah, that reminds me,
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.340]   I've seen images of what babies can see.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:46.180]   Parents love looking at their child
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.200]   and thinking that their child is looking right back at them.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.680]   And indeed, often the child is looking right back at them.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.820]   And your face to your child,
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.280]   sorry to break this to you folks,
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.760]   is incredibly blurry, even at that close distance
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.600]   for probably the first six to eight months even
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.040]   before you come into sharp relief.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.680]   They're not seeing the fine details of your face.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.840]   So smile big.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.120]   - That's right, smile big.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.220]   Keep those eyebrows dark.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:09.800]   - Right, and keep cooing at them
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.360]   'cause they can hear pretty well.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.200]   - That's right.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.320]   - Yeah, the optics of newborn babies
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:16.760]   are just dreadfully bad, but they need visuals too.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.760]   - Now other species, hawks, raptors, owls that hunt,
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:29.740]   they can naturally have 2010, '28 vision, right?
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:32.360]   So much better vision.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.420]   And that's just their normal vision,
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:36.720]   asbestos has been measured.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.120]   So there's definitely the potential for us
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.960]   to have better than 2020 vision.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.080]   Now, all of this we call visual acuity.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.600]   And just to be clear for everyone,
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.400]   that's the vision in the very center of your vision.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.080]   Like when you're reading or looking,
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.820]   that's the very center of your vision.
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:55.640]   Our vision is actually described variably
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.280]   as a hill of vision.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.140]   The peak is in the center.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:02.360]   That's let's say 2020 in most people, right?
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.240]   But it's normal to have that slope off.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.240]   And our visual acuity, your ability to read the eye chart
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.880]   on the edges of your vision,
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.240]   if you can read the big E, that's pretty normal.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:16.120]   Like you would be 2,200 out on the edges of your vision,
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.180]   and we would feel like, yep, that's pretty normal.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.440]   So our highest acuity vision's in the center.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.760]   And that's a big part of why we spend a lot of time
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.240]   using those eye muscles to look around, right?
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.140]   We gotta get a little bit of a high acuity view
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:33.520]   of what's around us, fill in the gaps
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.360]   of what our brain is interpreting
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.400]   our peripheral world to look like.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.140]   - It's almost like we have two visual systems.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:43.560]   We have a high acuity, high pixel density camera
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.680]   in the middle, and then surrounding that
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.760]   is a pretty low resolution, but very fast detector camera.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.440]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.800]   - You mentioned LASIK, but I wanna make sure
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.960]   that before we talk about LASIK
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.720]   that we talk a little bit about contact lenses.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.900]   Is there any detriment to having a piece of glass
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.160]   or a piece of plastic on the front of your eye all the time?
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.380]   And the reason I ask is not because I think
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:09.200]   we should live necessarily exactly like our ancestors,
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.820]   but it's a pretty bizarre adaptation
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:15.200]   to put a lens directly onto the front of the eye.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.840]   You have to imagine that the cells and tissues there
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.160]   are accustomed to getting a certain amount of oxygen,
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.960]   they're accustomed to getting a certain amount
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.080]   of interaction with the environment,
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.080]   and you also are now adding another surface
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.120]   the way that the tears are gonna interact
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.020]   with the cornea of the eye are probably changed.
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:34.160]   And who knows, maybe it doesn't make
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.240]   any negative difference at all,
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.980]   but putting a contact lens on the front of the eye
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:42.880]   is about as close to putting a device on your brain
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.760]   as I can think of, except for maybe the cochlear implant.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.880]   That's a great question.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.740]   Now, first of all, I wanna distinguish,
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:57.560]   there are a few really medical uses
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.780]   for different kinds of contact lenses,
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.840]   like scleral contact lenses,
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.680]   for people who have certain diseases, there are other kinds,
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.640]   but I think what we really wanna talk about right now
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.800]   is just kind of the run of the mill,
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.920]   I wanna get my prescription taken care of,
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:14.680]   but instead of wearing glasses, I'm gonna wear contacts.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.480]   Contacts, even the newest generation contacts,
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.000]   yes, they sort of change the tear dynamics
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.200]   on the surface of your eye,
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:30.200]   they decrease the oxygen diffusion
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:31.920]   that's just sort of out in the air
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.440]   onto the surface of our eye,
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.820]   onto the cells that are on the surface of our eye.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:41.080]   But most of us, especially as we're younger,
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.880]   have enough tear film reserve, enough oxygen reserve,
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.180]   that we can easily tolerate these polymer gel
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:53.660]   soft contact lenses and wear them happily.
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.460]   The advantage of contact lenses over glasses,
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:02.560]   purely from the perspective of correcting your vision,
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.400]   is that there's different elements
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:10.400]   of the shape of your eye that need to be corrected
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.520]   if you need corrective lenses.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.600]   And so for example, if the basketball shape of your eye
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.580]   is a little too steep or a little too shallow,
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:24.640]   that's what the standard glasses correct.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.880]   You may have been told
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:28.360]   that you have something called astigmatism.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.820]   That's where instead of having a basketball shaped eye,
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:33.660]   you have a slightly football shaped eye.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:37.980]   It's not round in the same dimensions on both axes.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.040]   And again, glasses can correct that.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.880]   But then there's higher order aberrations
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.660]   in our corneas in the clear window
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.160]   in the front of our eyes,
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.860]   or to some degree in the lens inside the eye
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.600]   that are focusing the light,
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.560]   that the glasses prescription can't correct.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.800]   But if you have a nice smooth contact lens on the front,
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.920]   it can correct.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.480]   So a lot of people who wear glasses and contacts
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.460]   will report that they have a much higher quality of vision
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.600]   with their contact lens correction
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.240]   than with their glasses correction.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.560]   And again, in service of enjoying the best vision
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.480]   that you can enjoy in your daily life,
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:19.540]   that's an upside to seeing if contacts could work for you.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.120]   Now there's another element though,
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.680]   and that's like, gosh, is there a risk of contact lenses?
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:27.140]   And especially as we age,
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:31.060]   we have less tear film reserves.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:34.700]   So contacts may become less tolerable as we age.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:38.340]   And the other thing is being really good about the cleaning
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:43.020]   because you know, the contacts can trap bacteria or fungus.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:46.860]   And if you get a corneal infection from a contact lens,
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.500]   it actually can be quite devastating to your cornea.
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.780]   Even if you successfully treat the infection,
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:54.380]   you can be left with some corneal scarring.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:57.040]   Thankfully, this happens very rarely,
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.120]   but when it does happen,
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.480]   it can be quite difficult on the person thereafter
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.180]   to sort of suffer through having maybe a scar
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.540]   from that infection on the surface of their cornea
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:10.040]   that leads to some blurring vision, for example.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.240]   So we always recommend that if you're going to wear contacts
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.620]   that you'd be really attentive
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.940]   to whether you're tolerating them well,
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.140]   and then also to be really attentive
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:24.380]   to the recommended use and cleaning of the contact lenses.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.200]   I actually recommend that even though
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:28.960]   they're a little more expensive to afford,
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.700]   that people should almost always
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:33.520]   be just using the daily contact lenses
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.680]   that they don't have to clean or use
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.500]   for two weeks or four week period.
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.020]   - So these are disposable contact lenses?
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.180]   - Daily disposable.
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:42.880]   And I hate to think of, I don't know,
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.540]   filling our oceans or what have you
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:47.300]   with more polymer plastic,
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.180]   but at least the contact lenses are small
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:53.940]   and it's much safer for your eye to use a daily disposable
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.740]   than to use a two week or a four week
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:58.260]   and be responsible for the cleaning.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.920]   The other thing to be really responsible about
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.080]   is sleeping in them overnight,
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.980]   because overnight when your eyelids are closed,
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:07.600]   of course, now you're getting even less oxygen
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.800]   to the surface of your eye.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.780]   And actually most bacteria,
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:14.100]   especially many of the infectious bacteria to our bodies
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:15.940]   and to the surface of our eye,
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:19.780]   are actually bacteria that don't really like oxygen.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:23.480]   And so we've got a low risk of getting bacterial infections
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.980]   on the surface of our eye.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.340]   But if we use contacts too much,
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.540]   don't clean them or sleep in them overnight
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:30.500]   when our eyelids are closed
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.520]   and now there's even less oxygen
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.820]   kind of helping keep the surface more clean, if you will,
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.280]   that increases the risk a lot.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:42.000]   So being really good with the recommended use
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.060]   and cleaning of the contacts is critical.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.780]   Considering daily use contacts, you don't have to.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.600]   And look, most contacts are gonna be the two week
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.140]   or four week kind where you put them
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:52.260]   in the cleaning solution overnight each time,
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:54.300]   give them a good rinse and put them back in the next day.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:58.860]   And again, most people, 99.99 some percent of people
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:00.980]   are gonna do just fine with that,
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:04.300]   follow the instructions and never get into trouble.
[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:06.740]   As we age, they're gonna become less tolerable.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.580]   People are gonna say,
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.620]   "I used to wear my contacts for 12 hours.
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.940]   Now my eyes feel really dry after six or eight or 10 hours."
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.360]   Maybe some years after that they say,
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.300]   "Gosh, I could barely use it for four hours.
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.860]   I only use them when I go out on a Saturday night."
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.700]   And that's okay.
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:24.660]   You can back off as you need to back off.
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:26.780]   But in the meantime, if it helps you,
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.980]   especially in the younger decades,
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:33.400]   if it helps you really enjoy your best vision, great.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:39.480]   - What about UV protection in eyeglass lenses
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:40.720]   and or contacts?
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:45.420]   I've dealt with many questions about blue light.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.700]   I am not somebody who believes
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.180]   that all blue light is terrible.
[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:50.680]   I think it's important to avoid bright lights
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.460]   of any wavelength late at night
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:54.780]   if you want your melatonin production to be normal
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:55.860]   and you want to sleep well.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:57.660]   It doesn't matter if you're wearing blue blockers or not.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:00.260]   If you're just under blastingly bright lights,
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:01.740]   it's gonna suppress your melatonin.
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:04.460]   And yet some people enjoy blue blockers for that reason.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:07.620]   Nowadays, a lot of people wear blue blocker glasses
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:10.260]   or blue blocking lenses or contacts
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:11.180]   throughout the entire day,
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:14.140]   thinking that blue light is bad for our eyes during the day.
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:15.620]   I happen to subscribe to the idea
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:16.780]   that we want as much bright light
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:18.560]   as we safely can tolerate during the day,
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.760]   ideally from sunlight.
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.900]   In order to set our circadian rhythm.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.900]   And yet a lot of eyeglasses
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.740]   and a lot of contact lenses out there
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:31.620]   have UVA and or UVB blocking features to them.
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.500]   So what are your thoughts on this?
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.880]   And I'm perfectly happy to be wrong
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:36.260]   and revise my stance on this.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:40.700]   Yeah, what do you think about this UVAB blocking?
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:44.320]   - Yeah, it's really important to distinguish
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:47.620]   that UV light on the light spectrum
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.340]   is right next to blue light.
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:51.120]   Red light's on the other end.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.960]   And of course, infrared is beyond that.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.880]   And our eyes, other animals can see these,
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.040]   but our eyes can't see infrared.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.000]   That's why we call it beyond red.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.120]   And we can't see ultraviolet.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.220]   We call it beyond violet.
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:07.160]   UV light is right next to blue light.
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:12.160]   UV light is known to have a lot of adverse effects.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.680]   It's not really good for our skin.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.340]   And therefore, we really want to avoid sunburn
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.040]   and kind of UV exposure and damage on our skin.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.200]   Similarly, it's not really good on our eyes
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.840]   and it affects both the ocular surface a little bit
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.880]   in terms of like kind of how dry or irritable
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.040]   your eyes might feel for some people.
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.000]   And certainly over the long term,
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.460]   UV light will accelerate the formation of cataract,
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:39.520]   which is a blurring of an oxidative blurring
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.720]   of the lens inside the eye.
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.520]   Profound UV light can be damaging to the retina
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:47.820]   if you're getting way too much on the inside.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:52.820]   So blocking UV light, I believe is just absolutely standard
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:56.860]   in every pair of eyeglasses.
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.820]   And I don't know actually how much to what degree
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:02.700]   the different kinds of contact lenses also filter
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.580]   at least UV light.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:07.060]   Now, blue blockers, blue blocking glasses
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.980]   is totally different.
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:12.480]   And as I say, like I think almost all glasses
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.820]   because the plastics, almost all glasses
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:17.940]   are not made of glass anymore, they're made of plastics.
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:20.900]   But I think almost all of them now filter the UV light,
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:24.740]   which again is like probably the safe move for our eyes
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:28.160]   and periocular environment, around the eye environment.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:32.660]   So blue blockers, you know, that's been a huge fad.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.980]   And I'll tell you the last three years through the pandemic,
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:36.980]   everybody getting on their computer,
[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:39.700]   hours in front of Zoom meetings where we used to walk
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.640]   from building to building for a meeting, things like that.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.140]   I, you know, I remember, you know,
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:50.700]   like this sort of big uptick in these kinds of questions.
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:53.940]   And I'm not sure that there's any data
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:57.560]   that blocking blue is helpful in any way.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:01.060]   And as you say, it may actually play into sort of
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:04.320]   circadian entrainment of our natural daily rhythm.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.160]   So I think blocking UV is a good idea
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.360]   and I think it's pretty standard.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.980]   You know, they make glasses, by the way,
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:13.620]   that actually react to UV light.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:14.900]   They're called transitions.
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:17.520]   There may be a few different brands, I don't know.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:21.320]   But, you know, these are the sunglasses that are clear,
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.880]   except then they turn dark if you're out in the sunlight.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.400]   And it's not just any sunlight,
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.520]   it's actually the UV wavelengths
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.440]   that cause the chemical reaction in the glasses to turn
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.900]   from clear see-through to sunglass blocked glasses.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.980]   And you may notice if you, if any of you out there
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:44.360]   are using these kinds of glasses,
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.320]   that they don't work in the car.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.080]   You'll wear them in the car and they won't go to sunglasses,
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.080]   even though it's sunny out.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.700]   And again, that's because all standard car glass
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.100]   also filters UV.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.720]   That's why if you're riding around in the car
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.740]   and it's sunny out, you've got your hand, you know,
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:01.760]   up next to the window wearing a t-shirt,
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.300]   you never get a sunburn through the car window anymore
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:09.300]   because all our car glass is also filtering UV light for us.
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:11.540]   - So that's a very informative answer.
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:13.400]   And before we started recording,
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.900]   you and I were discussing this practice
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:16.880]   of morning sunlight viewing, which again,
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.680]   I highly recommend over and over.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.880]   And you pointed out that low solar angle sunlight,
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.840]   so sunlight low in the sky,
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.880]   viewed for maybe 10 minutes a morning.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.360]   And again, not forcing oneself to look at it and stare,
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.440]   but blinking as needed is not going to cause
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.000]   extensive UV damage to the eyes.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.540]   It's really when the sun is directly overhead
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:40.200]   that we're getting a lot of UV,
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.300]   which raises this other question,
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:44.780]   which is for people that don't wear corrective lenses
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:47.400]   and therefore are not blocking UV light to the eyes,
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.520]   what should they do?
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.360]   Are they in trouble?
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.280]   Should they be wearing a brimmed hat?
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.480]   - Brimmed hat's a great idea that I'll get rid of
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.540]   a lot of the direct light into the eye.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:59.720]   Of course, you still have reflected light off of surfaces
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.780]   and that can include UV light, of course.
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:05.400]   You know, wearing sunglasses outside,
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.160]   even if you don't have corrective lenses,
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.260]   you know, it may also be more comfortable
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.960]   to wear sunglasses outside.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.520]   So these are all fine.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.560]   You know, at the end of the day,
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.000]   it's probably not making a huge difference
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:18.980]   in the health of your eye,
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:21.980]   whether you've spent the last 50 years wearing sunglasses
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:25.720]   really dogmatically for your outdoor time or not.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.520]   You know, if you were going to develop,
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:31.040]   let's just say age-related cataracts inside your eyes,
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.520]   which we'll all get cat, if we all live to 120,
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.800]   we all get cataracts.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:37.060]   You know, it's gonna happen.
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.160]   Some people younger, some people older.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.920]   Maybe if you were really dogmatic
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.100]   about wearing your UV blocking sunglasses,
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:46.040]   maybe you'd get your cataracts at 75 years old
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.560]   instead of 72 years old.
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.760]   It may not be a huge difference in that regard.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.080]   So again, not something to be super stressed.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.800]   I think it's more a question of just,
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.760]   what are you comfortable in?
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:57.960]   And then certainly I will say
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.840]   the other advantage of a wide-brim hat
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.920]   is it's keeping sun off of your face.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.880]   And these are the, you know, some of the,
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:07.160]   especially the upturned portions of your face,
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:08.400]   like the cheeks and the nose,
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.580]   these are the, some of the most common places
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:12.140]   to get some of the skin cancers
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:15.720]   that you can get over a lifetime of sunlight exposure.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.280]   So, you know, the wide-brim hat is,
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.380]   it's helping you for that as well.
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:23.000]   - Can't help but ask about comfort
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.960]   at varying levels of brightness.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.920]   I'm the person that when sitting in a cafe or something
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:28.880]   and on a bright day,
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.160]   I can be directly across from somebody like you
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.580]   who seems to be perfectly fine without sunglasses
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.440]   and maybe even more shaded under an umbrella
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.800]   or something of that sort, and I'm squinting like crazy.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.600]   Is it normal for there to be a wide variation
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:43.740]   in sensitivity to light?
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.160]   And does this have anything to do with the lightness
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:47.120]   or darkness of the eyes?
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.580]   You have brown eyes, I have green eyes,
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.340]   but is there any real correlation there?
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:53.320]   - Yeah, you know, it's a good question.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.900]   I don't know if it's been formally studied,
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.000]   but I will tell you, like,
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.940]   I have the same impression you do,
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:02.680]   which is that if you have blue eyes or light-colored eyes,
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:06.520]   that you're more likely to have more sensitivity.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.640]   We know that there's differences in the iris muscles
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.820]   that constrict and dilate in response to light.
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:16.760]   For example, when you go into your eye care provider
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.460]   and they're gonna do a dilated exam
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:20.200]   and they put the eye drops in your eye
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:21.360]   that dilate the eyes,
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.040]   they sort of change the nerve impulses onto the iris muscles
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.460]   so that the iris dilates
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.380]   and you get those big, big open eyes.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:33.960]   People with blue eyes, we absolutely know,
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:36.860]   blue or hazel or light-colored eyes,
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.960]   you put that eye drop to dilate their eyes,
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:41.720]   it's gonna last four, six, eight hours,
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.300]   whereas in a brown-eyed person,
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.580]   often the dilation will only last one, two, four hours.
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:50.180]   So there's clearly biological differences
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:52.700]   between the irises and their muscles
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.440]   and maybe the nerves that feed those muscles,
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:58.540]   between light-eyed people and darker-eyed people.
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:01.360]   And that may also therefore relate
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.340]   to this differential sensitivity that some people have.
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.780]   If you're not able to constrict your eyes
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:10.260]   in the bright light as effectively,
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:11.780]   you're gonna find that bright light
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:16.220]   more frustrating, more annoying, even painful.
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:19.260]   People will feel like their eyes are cramping almost
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:22.700]   as they try to get those eye muscles to activate,
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.500]   to bring down the pupil
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:27.680]   and block some of that excess light from getting in.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.020]   - Interesting.
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:30.220]   Let's go back to LASIK.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:35.220]   What is LASIK and should I get LASIK eye surgery?
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:36.660]   Does everyone need LASIK?
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.340]   Can it help every, can it make us, you know,
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:42.020]   super physiological, you know, can it make me a 2010?
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:43.640]   - You know, often it can.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.540]   I'll just say that, you know, right up front.
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:49.620]   It is amazing people will come out of LASIK surgery
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:51.140]   better than 2020.
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:53.780]   But the cornea we talked about before,
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:56.020]   that's the clear window on the front of your eye,
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:57.700]   all the light has to get through there.
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.140]   And we talked about before already,
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:01.100]   like if your cornea is misshapen,
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:06.040]   if the basketball shape of it is too shallow or too steep,
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.360]   then you're gonna need glasses to see at distance
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.680]   and also at near.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.260]   If it's too football instead of basketball,
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:14.780]   then it's gonna be what we call astigmatism.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:18.940]   And then you can't, you need a correction for that.
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:21.180]   Instead of correcting with glasses
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:23.420]   that sort of help shape the light
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:27.600]   so it can go through your slightly off shape cornea,
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.540]   instead of wearing contact lenses,
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:31.260]   which also shape the light
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:33.020]   just as it's entering your cornea,
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.820]   right on the surface of the eye,
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:37.860]   you can just reshape the cornea.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.740]   And the way LASIK does that,
[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:42.620]   there's a few different versions of LASIK,
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:44.700]   but basically the way the LASIK does that
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:49.700]   is it actually ablates or gets rid of a little ring
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:54.820]   or rim of that corneal tissue.
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:58.300]   So that for example, if you were a little shallow
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:00.580]   and you got rid of a little bit of that tissue
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.900]   around the edge with the laser,
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:05.980]   LASIK starts with the word laser.
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:07.500]   If you got rid of that edge tissue,
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:08.660]   then you're sort of making it
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.740]   a little more basketball shaped, right?
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:13.220]   Or if you were too steep on your cornea
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:15.580]   and you use the laser to kind of shave off
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:18.260]   a little bit of the tip of that basketball, right?
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:21.280]   Then you're flattening it out, flattening out the cornea.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.060]   So it's that kind of reshaping.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:27.080]   And the technology has come so far
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.240]   that the LASIK procedures can actually correct
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:35.260]   not just the regular aberrations that we talked about,
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:38.560]   but also some of these higher order aberrations.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:41.340]   And there are different monikers for this kind of LASIK.
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.140]   It's all I think become fairly standard,
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:47.420]   but wave front guided where it's actually using light waves
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:50.620]   to measure with a very exact localization,
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:55.040]   exactly how much and where to laser for each individual eye
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.200]   to make that cornea pass the light as ideally as possible.
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.780]   Now, one or a few percent of patients
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:04.020]   will actually have a dry eye problem.
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:07.460]   So after a LASIK, 'cause it does interfere a little bit
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:10.020]   with those corneal nerves, for example.
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:12.220]   And I do think that if you're a person
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.140]   who already has dry eye,
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:17.980]   hopefully if you're asking your eye surgeon about LASIK,
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:21.360]   hopefully you're being counseled that if you have dry eye,
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.260]   this might not be a good idea for you.
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.660]   Just like contacts might not be a good idea for you
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.380]   if you already have a lot of dry eye.
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:29.220]   But for a lot of people,
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:31.580]   especially a lot of younger people, it's quite common.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:35.540]   I think the statistics suggest maybe 15 or 20% of people
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:38.700]   who would benefit from LASIK,
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.540]   who would otherwise be wearing glasses
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.580]   may get LASIK at some point in their life.
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:46.580]   And I used to joke,
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:49.460]   LASIK, it costs more money than a pair of glasses,
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:52.260]   but it doesn't cost more money
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:54.520]   than 10 pairs of prescription glasses
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.860]   over the course of a decade or two.
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:58.980]   And so I used to joke that, gosh,
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:02.860]   if everyone had to have laser eye surgery
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:06.900]   for their best vision and someone came along and said,
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:08.380]   hey, I've got an invention,
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:11.660]   you don't have to have laser eye surgery anymore,
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:13.980]   it rests on the ears and the bridge of your nose,
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:15.940]   I call them glasses.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:18.980]   Could they have sold those for a thousand, $2,000 a pair?
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:20.380]   I don't know, maybe.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:23.980]   But there's kind of a cultural element of saying,
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:25.860]   I don't wanna wear glasses,
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.140]   I'd love to be able to walk around
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.460]   without relying on glasses or contacts.
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:31.500]   Of course, people who are very athletic
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.740]   or spending a lot of their time doing athletics,
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.060]   they may be quite irritated
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:37.660]   to have to deal with glasses or contacts.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.940]   People who have very severe prescriptions,
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:42.660]   I mean, if you wake up and you can't even really,
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:45.500]   you're fumbling for your glasses on the bedside table
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.860]   because you have such a strong prescription,
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:50.300]   you can't even see what it says
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:53.180]   on the alarm clock next to the bed.
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:54.960]   These are all groups of patients
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.980]   who really change their daily lives
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:00.740]   by getting out of glasses or contacts
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:02.620]   and taking advantage of LASIK.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:05.460]   And in, I don't know, 99% of the time,
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:07.940]   it's gonna be like a safe, comfortable outcome
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.100]   for the patient.
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:10.600]   - Do they do LASIK on kids?
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:15.300]   - There are certain conditions,
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:17.020]   unusual corneal conditions
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:19.160]   where procedures like LASIK get used,
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:24.160]   but I believe it's ideal to not do it on children
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:27.420]   or even young teenagers.
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:28.600]   And the reason goes back
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.360]   to what we were talking about before.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:34.840]   You are much more likely to change the shape of your eye
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.500]   and therefore the prescription you need,
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.200]   and therefore what exactly the LASIK would laser
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:43.440]   while you're still in those growing years.
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.180]   And you really wanna be able to say,
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:49.040]   "Hey, my eyeglasses prescription has not changed
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:51.900]   "in the last two or three or five years."
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:53.620]   Because if you do LASIK
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:56.100]   and then your eye keeps changing shape,
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:59.740]   then by the next year, all of a sudden the LASIK's not,
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.660]   you're back in glasses again, right?
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:04.720]   You can do a touch-up LASIK, do a little bit more,
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.420]   but it's generally, you're gonna be a happier person
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:10.460]   if you've reached that point in your life.
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.820]   And maybe that's your late teens,
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:15.140]   more commonly it's into the 20s
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.020]   where your eye has stopped changing
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.040]   its prescription every year.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.820]   You've been steady and stable for some years,
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:23.300]   and now you do the LASIK
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.460]   and it could easily last you a decade.
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:28.180]   - You mentioned dry eye.
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.900]   I get a lot of questions about dry eye.
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:33.780]   And a few years ago, I think you and I were at a meeting
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:38.300]   and someone who is very woven in with the companies
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:41.840]   that build and test drugs
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:45.060]   for different aspects of vision and health said,
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:47.520]   "You know what the field really needs
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.940]   "is a treatment that works for dry eye."
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:52.980]   And I thought, dry eye, like of all things, like why dry eye?
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:54.760]   And then the more I learned about it,
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.060]   I realized that there are millions and millions of people
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.940]   that really suffer from dry eye
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:02.820]   and for whom standard drops are just not working.
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:04.580]   So what underlies dry eye?
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:06.880]   Is it some deficiency in the lacrimal glands
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:08.300]   that produce tears for the eye?
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:11.240]   And I think of tears as just kind of salty water.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:14.820]   And I wonder if they are more than that.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.900]   Is there an oil in there?
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:18.260]   And if we know what's in tears,
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:20.580]   why can't somebody just manufacture something
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.020]   that works as well as tears?
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.620]   - Yeah.
[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:27.940]   It turns out, we've got a lot of other eye diseases,
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:32.260]   but by far the most common eye disease,
[01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:37.260]   and I've been told by far the most common eye treatment,
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:39.020]   you know, purchased by anyone.
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:41.080]   Now, granted, it's almost always over the counter,
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:44.620]   things like artificial tears, is for dry eye.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:47.960]   And in part, that's because as we age,
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:51.980]   our tear quantity goes down
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.980]   and our tear quality goes down.
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:55.480]   And so what do those two mean?
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:00.060]   We have two different major elements to tears.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:01.340]   And as you alluded to,
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:04.780]   one is the saltwater part of the tears.
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:07.500]   And those are made primarily by the lacrimal gland.
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.660]   And there's a steady drip of those tears
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:12.800]   onto the ocular surface as well as reflexive tearing, right?
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.260]   If you get an eyelash in your eye or you cry,
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.380]   your lacrimal gland will actually squeeze out
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:22.140]   extra saltwater tears onto the surface of the eye.
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:25.860]   And so that's where most of the sort of wet part
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.820]   is coming from.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:31.080]   But there's also essential oils, critical oils.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.220]   These come from other types of glands,
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:36.400]   including glands in our eyelids called meibomian glands.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.360]   And the oils form a surface
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:44.360]   over the saltwater part of the tear film
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.780]   and also intermix into the tears.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:52.020]   And as we age, we go down in the quantity
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:54.700]   of both saltwater part of our tears
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:58.560]   and oil part of our tears, but also the quality.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:03.220]   And in particular, the oil parts can often be seen
[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:05.760]   to be going down more quickly.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:10.760]   The eye drop industry has pretty much solved
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:15.240]   for replacing the saltwater part of your tears, right?
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:20.240]   You can get either bottles of preservative containing,
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:22.500]   you know, you could use that bottle all month
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:25.500]   or for a month or two, or you can buy these strips
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:28.340]   of preservative-free artificial tears,
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:31.560]   which are really basically like the saltwater component.
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.480]   And you can use those preservative-free ones.
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:37.020]   We have patients using them every hour if they need to,
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:38.620]   right, you're not gonna hurt anything
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:40.620]   with preservative-free artificial tears.
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:41.460]   - You just drop them in.
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.620]   - Just drop them in, yeah.
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:46.580]   Either eye, as often as you want or need when you feel it.
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.840]   It's exacerbated in the world we live in,
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:54.700]   especially these days now with more time on computer.
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:57.280]   It turns out that when you read,
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.980]   including when we maybe used to read more books
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:02.340]   than we do now, but also read on the computer
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:05.340]   or stare at the computer screen or work on the computer,
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:07.940]   or actually just even watch the TV,
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:09.460]   I've done very careful studies.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:13.260]   You blink less when you're doing any of those activities.
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.380]   And when you blink less,
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:19.700]   you're redistributing the tears less effectively,
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.680]   and you're squeezing out less of the tears,
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:25.880]   including less of the oils as effectively
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.900]   as you could be when you're blinking.
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:32.900]   And so between aging, tear quality, tear quantity,
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:36.360]   a lot of our activities,
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:38.260]   we're kind of in this losing proposition.
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:40.780]   Now, I mentioned that we're pretty good
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:43.280]   at replacing the wet, salty part of our tears,
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.020]   but actually as an industry,
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:47.640]   we haven't really figured out A,
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.340]   how to really effectively replace the oily part.
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:52.760]   And the oils do a few things,
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:55.180]   including when you have a layer of oil
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:57.580]   on top of a layer of water,
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:00.380]   the water's less likely to evaporate.
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:02.840]   And so the oils help hold the tears
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.100]   on the surface of your eye.
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:07.500]   And so if we're not making as many or as good oils
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.420]   as part of our tear film,
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.420]   that's also like kind of working against
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:14.460]   the saltwater part of our tears.
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:18.460]   So yeah, as an industry, as a community,
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:21.080]   we haven't really figured out
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.020]   how to get the oil part solved for,
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:27.220]   either by effectively replacing the oils
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:29.980]   or treating our eyelids in a way,
[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:32.640]   kind of rejuvenating those oil glands,
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:34.260]   getting them to kind of go back
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:36.260]   to their youthful state again, you know?
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:39.480]   So the eyes, including the eyelids and the oil glands,
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.160]   unfortunately they're aging just like the rest of our body.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:47.160]   So this is one of the major features is dry eye,
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:52.460]   and it's tough on patients because you feel it.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:54.620]   It's really tough because you feel it.
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:57.780]   - Yeah, I have yet another experience to report
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:00.560]   where when I had the blepharitis,
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.980]   which fortunately was transient,
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:03.940]   I also experienced that every time I would blink,
[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:05.500]   I could feel the blink.
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:06.660]   And boy, I'll tell you,
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:11.660]   we all, most of us take for granted
[01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:14.540]   what a pleasure it is to not observe
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:15.940]   the blinking of our eyes.
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.800]   Because for those, I think it lasted about two weeks,
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:19.700]   every time I blink,
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:22.340]   I'd feel an almost sandpaper-like experience.
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:23.940]   It wasn't particularly painful,
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.200]   but it was very uncomfortable
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:27.900]   because you're suddenly conscious of every blink
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:29.600]   and it's very distracting.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:32.580]   Now that resolved when the blepharitis resolved,
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:34.060]   but I can't even imagine what it would be like
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:36.420]   to deal with that all day long, every day.
[01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:37.580]   It's really dreadful.
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:38.660]   - Yes, it really is.
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:41.140]   And so you're absolutely right.
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:44.100]   It's a very, it's one of our really big unmet needs.
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:47.340]   And although for most people with dry eye,
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:50.460]   it can be managed with just the regular over-the-counter
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:53.300]   artificial teardrops you can buy at the grocery store
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:55.380]   or over the counter at the pharmacy,
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:57.180]   for a subset of people who have really
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:52:59.780]   much more severe symptoms with the dry eye,
[01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:01.460]   it's really, it's hard.
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:03.900]   It's a really hard thing to have to live with all the time.
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:06.080]   And we counsel on the use of tears.
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:08.980]   We counsel on the use of eyelid cleaning,
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:10.240]   like we talked about before,
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:12.160]   where you take either these eyelid scrubs
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:13.940]   or a little dilute baby shampoo
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:16.220]   to keep those eyelashes really clean.
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:18.660]   That keeps those oil glands functioning
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:21.140]   at their top capacity for you
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:24.620]   so that you're maximizing high quality tear production.
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:27.220]   Reducing inflammation is also important,
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:29.140]   whether that's inflammation from allergy.
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:32.340]   And of course, a lot of people's dry eye gets much worse
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:34.420]   in the spring with seasonal allergies,
[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:35.920]   when pollen is around,
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:38.340]   if you have dust allergies in your home,
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:42.340]   that worsens your symptomatic dry eye
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:45.380]   or other forms of inflammation.
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:47.140]   There's an element of dry eye
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:50.120]   that we actually think is inflammation
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.420]   kind of working against our tear glands.
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:55.740]   And in fact, some of the prescription drops now
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:54:00.580]   to help combat more severe dry eye are anti-inflammatory
[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:03.660]   or even low dose steroid types of eye drops.
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:08.380]   So I think these are all sort of next generation treatments.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:10.660]   I think at the really leading edge
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:11.980]   of next generation treatment
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:14.860]   is trying to better understand the nerves
[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:17.220]   on the cornea and ocular surface.
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.460]   And if there are ways that we could better treat them
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:23.660]   and help regenerate and rejuvenate kind of how the nerves
[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:27.000]   and the tissue cells are interacting
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.860]   underneath that tear film.
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:30.380]   And that's where for some patients,
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:33.780]   we can actually use either, for example, blood serum.
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:38.580]   Your blood serum is actually very rich in growth factors.
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:40.580]   And many of those growth factors,
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:43.580]   it turns out empirically are really helpful
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:45.180]   for people with dry eye.
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:47.000]   So if you're one of those people
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.700]   who's been really struggling with dry eye,
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:51.380]   you might ask your eye care provider,
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:53.540]   "Hey, I heard about serum tears.
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:55.420]   Is that something that could help me?"
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:57.700]   - Serum tears, so is this PRP?
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.340]   Is this platelet rich plasma?
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:02.940]   - Related, but not the platelet rich portion,
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:04.300]   at least not yet.
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:07.220]   They can draw your blood, spin out all the cells.
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:09.580]   You're left with the kind of liquid part of your blood.
[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:10.660]   That's the serum.
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:13.380]   And then they can dilute that with some saltwater,
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:16.300]   maybe with some preservatives in some cases.
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:17.660]   You could keep it in your freezer,
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:19.780]   thaw out the bottle when you're ready to use it,
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.700]   you know, each few weeks.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:24.260]   And then use it just like an eyedropper bottle.
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:28.580]   And those serum tears actually can be very helpful
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:31.140]   for people with much more advanced or severe,
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:33.360]   hard to control dry eye symptoms.
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:36.360]   Companies are really trying to figure out,
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:40.100]   "Hey, what are the most important parts of the serum?
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:44.220]   Can we just identify and package just the growth factor
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.860]   and turn that into a product for dry eye patients?"
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:51.100]   And so there's a lot of research on the ocular surface
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:56.100]   and dry eye going into that space right now.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.080]   I'll tell you the one other recommendation
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.920]   that I always give patients.
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.700]   There's a fair amount of evidence
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:04.560]   that if you're getting too much
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:07.640]   of some of these preservative chemicals,
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:10.120]   which of course, if you're gonna use an eye drop bottle
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:12.740]   for a month, it should have a preservative in it, right?
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:14.360]   So that, you know, open the bottle
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.580]   and then it grows bacteria a couple weeks later
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:20.860]   and now you're, you know, you're using contaminated eye drops.
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:23.720]   So for bottles, it's typical to have preservatives,
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.800]   but I really recommend for patients
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:28.100]   if they're using anything more than a couple drops
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:31.100]   here and there for their dry eye control
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:34.460]   to actually go for one of the preservative-free
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:35.400]   artificial tears.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:36.880]   They come in lots of brands.
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:39.340]   I'm sure the house brands at any of the pharmacies
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:41.480]   use them too, make them too.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.620]   And these are the ones that come in like strips,
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:46.220]   plastic strips, and you break one off.
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:47.980]   You break off the little cap.
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:49.980]   You could use as much as you want all day.
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:51.640]   You have to throw that one out
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.060]   if you have anything left over.
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:55.020]   You have to throw it out at the end of the night
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.620]   and the next day break off a new one
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:58.000]   because there's no preservatives.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.380]   And once you open it, you don't want bacteria to grow
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.520]   in that saltwater, right?
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.400]   But it's really good because the preservatives
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:09.060]   can be very irritating or even inflammatory
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:11.720]   to the ocular surface, to the surface of our eyes.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.540]   So we really do want to,
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:16.260]   if we're using more than a drop or two,
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:18.000]   upgrade the cost a little bit more money
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.540]   if they're still over the counter,
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:22.960]   upgrade yourself to the preservative-free artificial tears.
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:24.740]   - Those are great recommendations.
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:29.600]   I'm also really interested in this serum thing
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:34.220]   because we're this discussion taking place 10 years ago
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:38.140]   and I raise PRP, platelet-rich plasma.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:40.580]   There will probably be a lot of eye rolls, no pun intended,
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:43.420]   because I think myself and a lot of other people in the,
[01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:45.320]   it's called the sort of standard scientific
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:47.900]   and medical community, looked at platelet-rich plasma
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:49.580]   right alongside stem cell therapies
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:51.180]   because they were cheek to jowl back then.
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:53.120]   As you recall, before the FDA regulations
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:56.820]   about stem cell claims, which we will get to, of course,
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.280]   PRP was suggested as a source of stem cells.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.680]   It turns out there are very few,
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.920]   if any, true stem cells in PRP.
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:06.100]   And yet now, as I understand it,
[01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:09.980]   PRP is an FDA-approved protocol for injection
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:14.980]   into the uterus, injection into pretty much every tissue
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:17.420]   and organ system of the body
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:19.780]   in order to quote unquote rejuvenate it.
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:21.500]   And here I'm not promoting PRP
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:23.680]   and yet it is a very common practice now
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:25.580]   in more standard medical clinics,
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:27.080]   but it started off kind of niche,
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.260]   even gray market kind of underground.
[01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:31.660]   It's diverged from stem cell therapies.
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:34.520]   And we're going to talk about major modes of vision loss
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:37.760]   in a moment and this horrible situation
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.220]   that happened down in Florida
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:41.660]   of a clinic injecting stem cells into patients' eyes
[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:44.980]   to recover vision and it actually blinded them.
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:46.520]   So we'll talk about stem cell therapies,
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:50.640]   but for the record, is PRP something that's now standard
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:55.060]   in major ophthalmic clinics, excuse me,
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:57.380]   including your department at Stanford?
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:00.000]   Are you drawing out blood, spinning it down,
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.140]   taking plasma, taking serum and re-injecting it
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:05.640]   or reapplying it to patients' eyes?
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:09.020]   - Not yet in ophthalmology in eye clinics.
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:11.460]   I would say we're sort of like right now on the edge
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:14.100]   of groups are starting to study that.
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:15.340]   Is it safe?
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:16.580]   Is it valuable?
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:18.740]   Is it any better for certain conditions
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:22.020]   like on the ocular surface than serum tears, for example,
[01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:26.360]   this sort of diluting a patient's own blood serum.
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:27.920]   So it's being studied.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.340]   It's a very active area.
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:33.660]   Now, it turns out that this PRP plasma has,
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:37.060]   again, like a high concentration of growth factors.
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:39.300]   That's probably what's responsible
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:43.840]   for a lot of the kind of quote tissue rejuvenation effects
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:47.580]   be they as they may, but it's being studied,
[01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:51.000]   but it's definitely not a standard of care yet,
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.340]   at least in ophthalmology space.
[01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:56.660]   And I think whenever there's something really new,
[01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:59.140]   it really deserves to be properly studied.
[01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:02.860]   We talked before about at first you're gonna do trials
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:05.420]   where you just test it carefully in a few people,
[02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:09.220]   maybe a few of the most severely affected patients,
[02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:12.240]   be really thoughtful about the ethics
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.060]   of trying out for safety.
[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:17.060]   Then as you develop a little understanding of the safety,
[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:20.340]   you really wanna eventually get to properly controlled,
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:22.700]   randomized, what people in the community
[02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:24.380]   often call double blind trials,
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:27.340]   but we in ophthalmology like to call double masked trials.
[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:29.440]   - Blind is a bad word in ophthalmology.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:31.060]   - We wanna do blind trials, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:34.260]   So you really want properly controlled trials testing.
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:36.220]   Is it really working?
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:40.380]   Is it really deserve the claims that people are making?
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:43.300]   And that has not yet really come to fruition
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:46.460]   at that level for ophthalmology or eye care yet.
[02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:47.500]   - So we've been talking a lot
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:51.140]   about normal visual development, eye checks,
[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:53.600]   and some of the more typical challenges
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.900]   that people have with their vision,
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:57.220]   but we haven't yet touched on
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.240]   some of the really debilitating stuff.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:05.140]   Things like glaucoma, things like retinitis pigmentosa,
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:08.780]   macular degeneration, the things that if we could,
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:12.540]   we would all avoid and yet are out there in the world
[02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:14.140]   at pretty high rates.
[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:17.200]   I'm sure you'll share with us what those rates are.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:19.780]   And as bad as these things are,
[02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:23.820]   there are ways to detect and offset their progression
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:26.860]   so that people don't necessarily lose their vision.
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:28.740]   So if you could, could you share with us
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:31.400]   what are the major forms of vision loss
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:33.620]   in childhood and in adulthood?
[02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:35.960]   And what can each and all of us do
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:39.140]   in order to find out if we have one of these conditions
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:41.400]   and therefore treat it effectively?
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:42.920]   - Yeah, that's great.
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:47.180]   Let's start by just reminding ourselves
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:50.020]   what are the major causes of vision loss?
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:53.540]   And these are gonna differ where you are in the world,
[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:56.360]   but the number one cause of low vision
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:58.840]   is actually refractive error.
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:03.760]   People who need glasses and especially in other countries,
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:08.020]   affordability, access, can't even get glasses.
[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:10.240]   Okay, so that's just refractive error,
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.420]   but that's fundamentally correctable.
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:17.900]   The next most common cause of vision loss is cataract.
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:22.100]   Cataract is the blurring, the aging of the lens
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:23.980]   inside the eye, behind the cornea.
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:26.340]   We talked about how that is responsible
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.260]   for focusing light under the back of the eye.
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:29.480]   It also has to be clear enough
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:31.900]   that the light gets through the lens.
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:35.460]   And cataract is a normal aging process.
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:38.060]   As I said, if we all live to 100 or 110 years old,
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:41.220]   we'll all get cataracts, we'll all need cataract surgery.
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.680]   We actually, as in the eye clinic,
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:47.340]   we see cataracts years or even decades
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:50.740]   before they're affecting your vision in a meaningful way.
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:53.220]   So the cataracts are forming and that's okay,
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:55.880]   but at some point they get bad enough
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:57.820]   that it's time to take them out.
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:00.780]   We've actually solved for cataract surgery
[02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:02.580]   pretty efficiently.
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:05.780]   We can do a four to eight minute surgery.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:07.100]   Maybe if we're taking our time,
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:10.300]   it's 10 or 12 minutes of surgical time.
[02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:11.740]   Take out a cataract.
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:16.480]   It works beautifully, 99 point something percent of the time.
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:20.060]   We put a plastic, a clear plastic lens inside the eye,
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:22.660]   exactly where your lens used to be.
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:25.760]   And there's even lenses that can flex
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:27.980]   or focus light from far and near.
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:30.440]   So cataracts is fundamentally a,
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:31.620]   there's still room for improvement,
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:35.220]   but it's fundamentally a solved problem.
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:37.840]   The problem is, is that worldwide,
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:40.060]   there aren't enough cataract surgeons.
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:42.140]   There's not access to care.
[02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:46.860]   The machinery or the lenses cost too much money
[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:51.020]   in developing countries to get out to the number of people
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:52.340]   who would need them.
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:54.600]   So it's actually just, again, an access to care.
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.500]   Cataract is a reversible, treatable,
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:04:00.060]   easily treatable problem,
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:03.820]   but it's number two on the list of causes of vision loss
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:06.180]   in the world because we don't have enough access to care.
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:08.560]   We need a lot more sort of programming
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.780]   around global ophthalmology, global eye care
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.740]   to solve for cataract,
[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:16.380]   just to bring that solution to countries around the world.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:21.480]   Then after that, you start hitting the eye diseases
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:25.440]   that lead to what are currently irreversible,
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:29.220]   non-reversible causes of vision loss.
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:33.140]   The number one cause of irreversible vision loss
[02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:35.900]   in the world is glaucoma.
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:36.740]   So what is glaucoma?
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:39.020]   Glaucoma is actually probably a little cluster
[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:42.420]   or constellation of diseases that we lump together.
[02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:47.100]   It's a degenerative disease, like a neurodegeneration.
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:49.020]   We talk about neurodegenerations in the brain,
[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:50.740]   like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:53.840]   Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease.
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:56.660]   It happens instead of affecting one or a different area
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:05:00.220]   in your brain, it happens to affect the optic nerve
[02:05:00.220 --> 02:05:01.740]   that connects the eye to the brain.
[02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:03.340]   And we need our optic nerves to carry
[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:06.700]   all the visual information from the eye to the brain.
[02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:11.060]   And so if your optic nerve is degenerating in glaucoma,
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:14.380]   and I should add, there are other optic neuropathies,
[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:16.900]   so-called diseases of optic nerve degeneration.
[02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:19.820]   For example, you can get a stroke of the optic nerve.
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:22.080]   You can have an inflammatory disease
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:25.180]   like multiple sclerosis called optic neuritis
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:27.340]   that affects the optic nerve.
[02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:30.340]   So you can get other optic nerve diseases,
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:33.340]   but glaucoma is by far the most common optic neuropathy.
[02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:37.740]   And the problem is, is just like spinal cord injury,
[02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:40.340]   which is also part of the central nervous system, right?
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:42.660]   The brain, the spinal cord, the retina, the optic nerve.
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.140]   That's the central nervous system.
[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:46.220]   And there's no regeneration.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:47.660]   And that's why spinal cord injury
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:49.840]   leads to permanent paralysis.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:53.280]   Well, optic nerve injury or optic nerve degeneration,
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:56.240]   unfortunately, leads to permanent vision loss.
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:59.860]   So in the case of glaucoma, how do we get ahead of that?
[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:03.100]   Glaucoma has two major risk factors.
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:04.840]   One is increasing age.
[02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:08.820]   There are actually infantile and pediatric glaucomas,
[02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:12.060]   unfortunately, and those can be much more aggressive,
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:16.180]   much more damaging when they present so early in kids,
[02:06:16.180 --> 02:06:17.820]   in babies and in children.
[02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:21.000]   Most of the kind of run-of-the-mill glaucoma
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.980]   usually presents in adulthood and even in the aging adults.
[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:28.220]   So much more common after 50 or 60 or 70 years old,
[02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:29.540]   increasing.
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:31.620]   The other main risk factor for glaucoma
[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:33.820]   is increasing eye pressure.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.540]   The eye actually, you know, it stays inflated.
[02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:37.360]   It's a balloon.
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.500]   It has to stay inflated.
[02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.100]   We need some amount of eye pressure
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:43.020]   to keep our eye as an inflated balloon.
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:46.160]   But if the eye pressure goes too high,
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:47.540]   and we talked about this before,
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:50.960]   you won't even feel it if it slowly gets too high.
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:55.580]   If the eye pressure goes too high, that causes glaucoma.
[02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:58.700]   And that's one of the things that we talked about.
[02:06:58.700 --> 02:07:02.340]   You really include in a comprehensive eye exam
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:04.680]   when you're just getting a screening checkup
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:07.020]   at your eye care provider, at your optometrist
[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:08.300]   or ophthalmologist office.
[02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:09.740]   They're going to check your pressure.
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:11.280]   And just as a screening tool, check
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.640]   to make sure it's not too high.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:18.700]   We can treat glaucoma today by trying
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:21.220]   to reduce the impact of that high pressure
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:23.380]   by lowering the eye pressure.
[02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:25.460]   So we have treatments for glaucoma
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:26.840]   that target the eye pressure.
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:29.400]   We have medications like eye drops.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:33.700]   We have lasers that can be used inside the eye that can also
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:35.160]   lower the eye pressure.
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.880]   And ultimately, if we need them, we also have surgeries
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:41.400]   that can also provide an outflow that lets the fluid out
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:44.960]   of the eye in a controlled way so that the eye pressure can be
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:48.640]   brought back down into normal ranges.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:52.500]   Again, the reason that glaucoma ends up
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:55.800]   being the number one cause of irreversible blindness
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:08:01.020]   in the world is number one, we can't get those therapies
[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:02.040]   everywhere in the world.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:04.800]   The affordability of eye drops, the access
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:07.580]   to lasers or surgical procedures around the world
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:10.200]   isn't equal to what it is here.
[02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:12.880]   And even within our country, people
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:15.680]   may not be accessing health care effectively
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:19.200]   to get screened for glaucoma or to get treated for glaucoma.
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.080]   The other big problem with glaucoma
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:24.960]   is that it affects our peripheral vision first.
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:27.540]   And only very late in the disease
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:30.320]   does it pinch in and finally pinch off
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:34.760]   the center of our vision in typical glaucomas.
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:38.300]   And that's a real problem because we don't notice
[02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:40.620]   if our peripheral vision is down.
[02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:44.080]   Our peripheral vision isn't that good to begin with.
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:47.040]   And if you're driving and you can see a pedestrian step off
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:50.500]   the sidewalk, you think your peripheral vision is fine.
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.020]   But actually, your peripheral vision
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:55.060]   could already start being damaged by glaucoma,
[02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:58.160]   and you won't notice it in regular daily life.
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:01.520]   And that's where the importance of screening and early
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:05.400]   detection really comes in for glaucoma.
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.120]   What we don't have for glaucoma, we
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:10.560]   can come back to what's the cutting edge of the future
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:11.680]   in these eye diseases.
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:13.320]   What we don't have are treatments
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:17.880]   that really target the optic nerve degenerative process.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:20.760]   And we can come back and talk about that.
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:23.240]   So that's glaucoma and optic neuropathies.
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:29.360]   Then the next two major causes of currently largely
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:33.360]   irreversible vision loss are age-related macular
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:39.120]   degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:41.700]   Now, age-related macular degeneration
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:43.480]   is just like it sounds.
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:45.440]   Major risk factor is age.
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:46.620]   It's very common.
[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:49.240]   And actually, in the developed world,
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:50.740]   countries that are more developed--
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:52.080]   also countries that have a larger
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:54.560]   Caucasian white population.
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:58.480]   It's more common in certain populations than in others.
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.200]   It actually is definitely a leading cause
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:04.840]   of vision loss in the elderly population,
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:08.000]   for example, in the United States.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.940]   And there's two forms of macular degeneration,
[02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:17.400]   but they both end up targeting the same part
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:18.400]   of the retina.
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:19.920]   And the part of the retina is really
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.680]   like the rods and the cones that we talked about before.
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:26.360]   The rods do your low-light vision at nighttime.
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:28.600]   Primarily, your cones do color vision
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:31.440]   and bright light, sort of normal lighting
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.760]   that we experience through most of our awake day.
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:37.840]   And in that back of the retina, you
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:42.260]   can have what's called dry macular degeneration, which
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:47.520]   is a slow, thankfully slow, but slow, insidious disease that
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:51.280]   causes the degeneration of the rods and cones,
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:54.760]   and also the support cells that help feed the rods and cones
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:56.400]   and take care of the rods and cones.
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:59.740]   They're called RPE cells, retinal pigment epithelium.
[02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:02.080]   It's not really critical, of course,
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:03.840]   the names of every different cell type.
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.560]   But these are like the light-collecting cells
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:09.680]   in our eyes in the retina, and they degenerate
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:11.600]   in macular degeneration.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.840]   And in the dry form, there's this slow degeneration.
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.540]   But some percent of people with the dry form
[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:19.160]   of macular degeneration will actually
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:22.040]   convert to what's called the wet form.
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:24.960]   It's called wet because new blood vessels actually
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:29.660]   grow inappropriately under and even into the retina.
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:32.760]   And new blood vessels, unlike our mature blood vessels,
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:34.520]   tend to be leaky.
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.640]   And so the fluid leaks out of those blood vessels,
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:39.780]   gets into the retina, interferes with vision.
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:43.900]   And that can lead to a much more acute loss of vision.
[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:49.100]   Now, we have some treatments for wet macular degeneration.
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.920]   We have injections that can go into the eye that actually
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:56.080]   fight against the molecules that are causing those new blood
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:57.560]   vessels to grow.
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:00.200]   And these are antibodies that can be injected into the eye.
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.520]   And they can be very effective controlling patients'
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:06.160]   wet macular degeneration.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.760]   It's been a much bigger uphill battle,
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:12.400]   even over the last decade as advances are being made,
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:18.120]   to really try to knock back or slow down even the dry form
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:19.960]   of macular degeneration.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:22.120]   There was just some exciting news, even just
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:23.480]   in the last few months.
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:30.440]   The first successful trials of a treatment for the dry form
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:34.040]   have just shown success in properly randomized controlled
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:37.480]   human clinical trials, phase III clinical trials.
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:40.360]   So it's an exciting time.
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:43.200]   Those new treatments are not going to be a panacea.
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:47.700]   They slow the progression, like the anatomic progression
[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:52.120]   of the disease, maybe by 20% or 25%.
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:54.400]   So patients are still going to get worse even
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:55.400]   with those treatments.
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.480]   So there's still a lot more to be
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:01.240]   done to really knock back macular degeneration.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.080]   I want to mention, you mentioned retinitis pigmentosa.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:09.120]   That's like an inherited form of a type of macular degeneration.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:11.880]   It's also affecting the rods and cones
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:14.360]   and also the support cells, the RPE cells
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:15.400]   in the back of the eye.
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:19.420]   Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited form.
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:22.180]   There are actually many different genes
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:25.420]   you could have that could lead to retinitis pigmentosa.
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:29.180]   In aggregate, if you add up all the people with all
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:31.220]   those different genes--
[02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:34.340]   and it can be very devastating, because it can really
[02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:37.300]   affect the vision, knock out your vision very early in life,
[02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:41.000]   including in children and even versions of that in babies.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.900]   But you add that all up, it's still much less common
[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:46.740]   in aggregate than macular degeneration.
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:49.280]   But in a way, it's quite a bit more severe,
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:52.440]   because it does affect people much earlier in life.
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.300]   So I sort of clump those together.
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:56.400]   Macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa,
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:00.260]   degeneration of the rods and cones and the support cells,
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:02.500]   the RPE support cells.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:04.920]   And then you can't have this part
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:07.620]   of the discussion about what are the devastating eye diseases
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:09.660]   without bringing up diabetic retinopathy,
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:14.740]   especially because diabetes, unfortunately, really continues
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:19.220]   to grow in, especially, let's say, in the United States,
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:21.900]   certainly in the developed world.
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:25.180]   As we, especially type 2 diabetes,
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:27.860]   with eating habits, exercise habits,
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:31.240]   contributing to a proliferation of some of the risk
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:37.040]   factors for type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity,
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:39.940]   we're unfortunately seeing a proliferation, a growth
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:42.100]   in the number of people with diabetes.
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:44.540]   And with the growth in diabetes, unfortunately,
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:47.980]   comes a growth of the complications of diabetes.
[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:51.780]   And one of the major complications of diabetes
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:54.180]   is damage to the retina inside the eye,
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:56.980]   and we call that diabetic retinopathy.
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:15:01.700]   And there, again, some of the same damage that occurs,
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:05.020]   especially when in diabetes, again, some new blood vessels
[02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:08.240]   are growing or blood vessels are leaky, some of that
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.180]   can be treated with--
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:13.100]   used to be lasers, and now more commonly is often
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:16.820]   being treated with some of the same injectable drugs that are
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:19.720]   treating macular degeneration.
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:22.020]   But there's still a lot of vision loss
[02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:25.060]   with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy.
[02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:29.100]   I think that's an area where, again, early screening,
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:31.240]   making sure if you have diabetes,
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:33.540]   that's an indication where you definitely
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:37.740]   have to be going in and getting your at least annual exam
[02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:39.780]   with an eye care provider or having someone
[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:42.420]   take a photograph of the inside of your eye
[02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:44.220]   and rate that photograph to say if you have
[02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:46.980]   any diabetic retinopathy or not.
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:48.900]   In terms of interventions, can we
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:50.780]   talk about diabetic retinopathy first?
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:52.780]   Because, of course, type 1 diabetes
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:55.060]   is a failure to produce insulin.
[02:15:55.060 --> 02:15:58.180]   Relatively rare compared to type 2 diabetes, which,
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:00.460]   as you mentioned, is proliferating
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:02.340]   in developing countries, right?
[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:05.860]   This is probably unprecedented in the sense
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:09.460]   that developing countries have better medical care typically
[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:13.860]   than non-developed countries, more opportunities for food
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:16.100]   nourishment, and yet it's clearly
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:19.740]   a problem of overnourishment, insulin insensitivity,
[02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:22.060]   obesity, et cetera.
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:24.300]   Is this type of diabetic retinopathy
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:28.380]   that one observes the same for type 1
[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.320]   diabetics versus type 2 diabetics?
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:32.760]   Because my understanding is that type 2 diabetes,
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:37.760]   this insulin insensitivity, is a bit of a continuum, right?
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:40.920]   I mean, the type 1 diabetes, as far as I know,
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:41.760]   is all or none.
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:43.420]   You either make insulin or you don't.
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:45.280]   But type 2 diabetes, someone could be
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:49.860]   mildly insulin insensitive or severely insulin insensitive.
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:53.920]   And sometimes I'm told people are not necessarily obese
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:56.660]   and can have type 2 diabetes as well.
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:58.820]   Certainly things like smoking and alcohol intake
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:00.180]   can contribute to that.
[02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:04.040]   So how equivalent are type 1 and type 2 diabetes
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:08.280]   when framed under the umbrella of diabetic retinopathy?
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:13.280]   - Yeah, the time to presentation can be different.
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:17.000]   A type 1 diabetic usually presents
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:21.100]   with sort of a cataclysmic sudden loss,
[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:24.500]   sudden sort of final loss of their ability to make insulin.
[02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:27.700]   It usually presents in childhood or teenage years,
[02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:28.740]   but can present.
[02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:31.740]   You can have late onset type 1 diabetes.
[02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:35.080]   Because it's kind of a sudden presentation,
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:38.040]   it can take some years after that
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:41.100]   to show any diabetic retinopathy.
[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:43.940]   Whereas just because, just like you said,
[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:46.020]   type 2 diabetes can be on a continuum.
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:49.020]   And people can have like kind of a mild type 2 diabetes,
[02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:52.780]   but kind of be getting along, going through life,
[02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:56.140]   kind of maybe not even realizing at first.
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:58.660]   And so when you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes,
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:02.300]   you've probably had some insulin resistance
[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:04.860]   for the years prior to your diagnosis.
[02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:08.100]   And so in that case, you often can have,
[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:11.380]   you know, like you're at higher risk for presenting sooner
[02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:14.420]   with the complications of diabetes,
[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:16.240]   like diabetic retinopathy.
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:21.240]   Now, given that the actual retinopathy is very similar,
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:27.020]   maybe the same between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
[02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:30.640]   And again, it involves things like leaky blood vessels,
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:32.340]   new blood vessel growth.
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:34.660]   There's some amount of neurodegenerative dysfunction
[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:36.660]   that just simply occurs.
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:40.900]   So you can have little hemorrhages or bleeding spots
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:45.660]   in the retina, tiny little strokes or microvascular events
[02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:47.100]   in the retina.
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:50.600]   So that can happen in either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:52.340]   Once you start having the retinopathy,
[02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:54.420]   it does look pretty similar.
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:57.940]   So what can people do to prevent
[02:18:57.940 --> 02:18:59.800]   or treat diabetic retinopathy?
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:02.800]   Obviously the type 1 diabetic needs to take insulin
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:04.880]   in order to survive, really.
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:07.700]   Type 2 diabetics need to get their obesity under control
[02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:09.680]   if they are in fact obese
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:14.300]   and get their blood sugar levels under control regardless.
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:15.380]   That's my understanding.
[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:20.340]   And by extension, are you seeing any reductions
[02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:22.380]   in diabetic retinopathy with people
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:26.140]   that are taking these glucagon-like peptide mimics
[02:19:26.140 --> 02:19:29.460]   like Ozempic, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes?
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:31.660]   - Yeah, it's been a very exciting development
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:33.340]   for the diabetes field,
[02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:38.340]   this new class of anti-diabetic drugs.
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:43.540]   And so you've touched on a couple of them.
[02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:48.540]   There are a few key things for reducing the risk of diabetes
[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:52.580]   or the impact of diabetes on your retina at risk
[02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:56.780]   of diabetic retinopathy or impact of diabetes on your retina.
[02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:01.840]   One is, as I mentioned, get regular eye exams, be screened.
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:05.540]   Any diabetic should be screened at least once a year
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:08.840]   with a good comprehensive retinal exam
[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:11.440]   looking for any of these items.
[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:15.260]   The number one most important element
[02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:17.660]   to prevent diabetic retinopathy
[02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:19.940]   is to control your diabetes
[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:22.500]   and having a real good blood sugar control,
[02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:24.340]   keeping your hemoglobin A1C,
[02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:26.340]   which is one of the blood tests that gets used
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:28.300]   to measure how your kind of long-term
[02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:30.140]   diabetes management is going.
[02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:35.880]   That's really first and foremost the most important.
[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:38.380]   And that's been shown in large clinical trials.
[02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:40.140]   They actually randomize patients to,
[02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:42.460]   hey, take care of your diabetes
[02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:45.660]   or do a real good job taking care of your diabetes.
[02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:47.740]   And the patients who did a real good job
[02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:49.060]   taking care of their diabetes
[02:20:49.060 --> 02:20:52.140]   have much less diabetic retinopathy.
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:53.380]   So that's number one.
[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:57.540]   It turns out that if you have high blood pressure
[02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:02.540]   and diabetes, that blood pressure is also really damaging
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:05.300]   to your retina, also, by the way, the kidneys
[02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:06.820]   and probably all the other organs
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:09.300]   that are suffering from the diabetic insult.
[02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:12.020]   So in addition to controlling blood sugar,
[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:16.100]   really important to have blood pressure under great control.
[02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:18.380]   Now, both blood sugar and blood pressure
[02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:19.780]   in type two diabetics,
[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:22.140]   especially if you're catching them early,
[02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:25.340]   can be improved with some of these
[02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:28.820]   so-called lifestyle changes like improving eating,
[02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:31.140]   watching what your food intake is,
[02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:35.120]   getting good exercise, trying to lose weight.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:39.540]   So these are definitely on that list of how do you get
[02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:43.100]   to good blood sugar and blood pressure control.
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:46.020]   But suffice it to say blood sugar
[02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:49.020]   and blood pressure control right at the top.
[02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:53.020]   And then also including the regular, at least annual exams.
[02:21:53.020 --> 02:21:56.380]   And then if diabetic retinopathy is detected
[02:21:56.380 --> 02:21:58.180]   and blood sugar and blood pressure control
[02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:00.660]   are not going to be enough for that patient,
[02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:03.020]   we do have treatments, as I mentioned before,
[02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:04.580]   there are drugs that can be injected
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:07.900]   if your retina is getting kind of leaky blood vessels
[02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:09.580]   from diabetes.
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:13.420]   There are treatments that we can give the eye specifically
[02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:16.900]   to try to counter the diabetic retinopathy.
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:18.340]   - Terrific.
[02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:20.700]   In terms of glaucoma, as you mentioned,
[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:23.300]   glaucoma is related to pressure,
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:26.520]   although there is pressure normal glaucoma.
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:30.740]   Glaucoma is a death of the retinal ganglion cells,
[02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:33.340]   the neurons that connect the eye to the brain.
[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:34.660]   And once they are gone,
[02:22:34.660 --> 02:22:37.040]   at least at this point in human history,
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:38.040]   they can't be replaced.
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:40.500]   Although hopefully because of work that you've done
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:42.580]   and other laboratories are doing at some point,
[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:44.540]   that statement I just made will not be true
[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:47.440]   and the RGCs can be replaced.
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:51.500]   Meanwhile, what can and should people do
[02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:56.000]   to find out if they have glaucoma and to treat glaucoma?
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:00.660]   And is it true that even if somebody has normal pressure,
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:03.300]   that lowering their eye pressure further
[02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:04.880]   protects them against glaucoma?
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.300]   - Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:10.760]   So most important is to get screened with a formal exam
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:13.360]   at your optometrist or ophthalmologist,
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:17.440]   because you won't notice, you won't have any symptoms
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:19.360]   if your eye pressure is too high.
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:23.480]   You're not likely to notice until very late in the disease
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:26.340]   if your peripheral vision is being damaged
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:27.980]   through the course of glaucoma.
[02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:30.460]   So most important as to have a screening exam,
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:32.380]   a good comprehensive screening exam,
[02:23:32.380 --> 02:23:35.580]   will always include checking the eye pressures
[02:23:35.580 --> 02:23:38.380]   and also looking in the back of your eye.
[02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:41.220]   The head of the optic nerve where all the fibers
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:43.740]   leave the eye and carry the optic nerve information
[02:23:43.740 --> 02:23:45.700]   back to the brain, we can see that
[02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:47.660]   when we look inside your eye.
[02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:52.660]   And glaucoma has a fairly characteristic look to it
[02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:53.700]   in the optic nerve head.
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:56.900]   So looking at the optic nerve head,
[02:23:56.900 --> 02:24:00.180]   we have imaging and peripheral vision testing
[02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:03.420]   that can also be included in those screening exams.
[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:05.820]   So if you really get a comprehensive screening exam,
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.380]   you can very reliably detect if you have glaucoma
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:12.340]   to worry about or you're in the clear.
[02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:13.860]   If you have glaucoma to worry about,
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:15.920]   we have treatments and you're absolutely right.
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:19.320]   Whether you start with a abnormally high pressure
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:22.060]   or you start with a pressure that's on the face of it
[02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:25.460]   in the normal range, in either case,
[02:24:25.460 --> 02:24:27.180]   lowering the pressure has been shown
[02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:31.060]   in large properly controlled clinical trials
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:34.940]   to slow the progression of optic nerve damage
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:36.620]   and vision loss.
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:40.540]   So absolutely in either case, starting with high pressure
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:42.320]   or starting with normal pressure,
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:45.260]   in either case, you've got to lower the pressure further.
[02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:47.060]   And as I mentioned, we have eye drops.
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:48.880]   Those are usually the first line.
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:52.100]   There's very good data that there's a very benign
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:53.360]   non-invasive laser.
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:56.200]   It's not the same kind of laser that gets used for LASIK,
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:59.360]   but there's a benign, very safe type of laser
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:04.200]   called selective laser trabeculoplasty, SLT we call it.
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:06.960]   And that's also very effective as a first line.
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:09.840]   Actually in the largest clinical trial
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:11.700]   from which the data have been coming out,
[02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:13.000]   just even over the last few years,
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.060]   it's called the LIGHT trial.
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:17.600]   In the LIGHT trial, patients with glaucoma
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:20.080]   were randomly assigned to either get the laser
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:24.240]   or the sort of most common first strongest eye drop
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:27.520]   that gets used clinically.
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:30.600]   And actually on many features,
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:32.840]   they both worked at least as well.
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:34.480]   But when looking out over the long-term,
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:38.080]   actually the laser had some advantages over the eye drop.
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:39.460]   Not in the least of which, by the way,
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:41.480]   it's very nice for patients to not have to like,
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:43.540]   remember to use the eye drop every night.
[02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:46.760]   And so that's quite helpful, I think,
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:49.680]   to keep in mind as a treatment option
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:51.760]   early in the course of the disease.
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:54.360]   Of course, if the eye drops and or lasers
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:56.100]   are not enough early in the disease,
[02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:58.020]   we also have surgical approaches
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:00.360]   to lower the eye pressure further.
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:03.440]   You know, even with all of our treatments,
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:05.520]   all of these treatments stepping patients
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:10.520]   through all of this, about 10, 15, even 20% of patients
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:14.140]   will lose very meaningful functional vision.
[02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:16.620]   And maybe five, 10, 15% of patients,
[02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:19.240]   especially depending where you are in the world,
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:22.260]   will go blind from glaucoma,
[02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:27.260]   including in, you know, quote-unquote developed countries.
[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:30.860]   There's still a very significant cohort of patients
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:33.280]   that go blind, legally blind,
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:35.360]   and then, you know, absolute blindness.
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:38.500]   Like, can't even tell if the lights are on in the room.
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:41.860]   So it's devastating, it's insidious,
[02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.760]   it's hard to detect early.
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:47.360]   And so glaucoma's still a tough one,
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:50.540]   even with all of the treatments that we have.
[02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:53.040]   - Okay, so get your pressures checked, folks.
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:56.360]   And if you are prescribed drops, take your drops.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:59.240]   I hear about patients not taking their drops,
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:02.040]   which to me just seems baffling,
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:06.400]   but I guess having to do something day in and day out
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:07.740]   can be troublesome enough
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:10.320]   that unless people are losing their vision very quickly
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:12.040]   or they are very afraid of losing their vision,
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:14.180]   sometimes they just neglect to take them.
[02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:16.080]   - It's hard, it's hard for glaucoma eye drops,
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:18.760]   it's hard for taking your blood pressure medication,
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:20.040]   it's hard for a lot of medicines.
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:21.760]   You know, if you're taking a medicine
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:23.300]   where you don't feel better,
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:25.920]   you know, if you have a headache and you take an aspirin
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:30.240]   or Tylenol or an ibuprofen, you know, you feel better,
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:31.360]   you feel reinforced.
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:34.340]   Gosh, taking that pill made sense, right?
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:36.180]   But if you're using an eye drop that like,
[02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:38.820]   hey, this is gonna protect you for the next 20 years
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:39.840]   from losing your vision,
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:43.360]   but you don't notice every day that anything's better.
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:45.780]   And by the way, the eye drops could be a little irritating,
[02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:47.700]   maybe it stings a little for a minute or two
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:48.560]   when you put it in your eye.
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:51.600]   Some people are even less tolerant of the eye drops.
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:53.520]   It's hard to feel motivated every day,
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:55.480]   and we know that, we call that compliance.
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:59.200]   We know that it's very hard for patients to stay compliant
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:02.620]   with prescribed medications where they don't feel
[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:06.120]   or notice a difference in a daily way.
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:11.640]   - I realize that we can't stop aging yet,
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:13.180]   but right now you can't stop aging,
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:15.800]   and age is a risk factor for glaucoma.
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:20.800]   My understanding is so is smoking or vaping nicotine,
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:25.660]   and so is alcohol.
[02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:28.140]   And by that reasoning,
[02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:30.960]   should people strive to drink less and smoke less,
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:32.700]   including vaping nicotine less,
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:34.880]   if they are concerned about glaucoma?
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:37.960]   - Yeah, and not just glaucoma, macular degeneration.
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:39.640]   Actually, macular degeneration
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:41.800]   has a couple major risk factors.
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:45.100]   Macular degeneration aging, just like with glaucoma,
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:47.140]   major risk factor.
[02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:50.900]   Smoking, including exposure to secondhand smoke,
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:53.300]   major risk factor for macular degeneration
[02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:55.660]   and for the progression and vision loss
[02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:58.360]   potentially associated with macular degeneration.
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:28:59.680]   In the case of macular degeneration,
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:01.100]   there's also a couple of genes
[02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:02.820]   that we've sequenced the human genome,
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:03.960]   and there's a couple of genes
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:06.680]   associated with macular degeneration too.
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:08.900]   That's less true for your typical run-of-the-mill
[02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:10.120]   adult glaucoma.
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:11.640]   There are genes for the pediatric
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:14.480]   and infantile forms of glaucoma.
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:19.040]   So, yeah, smoking 100%, including vaping,
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:20.480]   it's a no-no for your eyes,
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:22.700]   just like it's a no-no for the rest of your body.
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:25.360]   And it's tough as the eye doctor
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:27.440]   to have these conversations with patients
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:28.520]   'cause you kind of feel like,
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:31.300]   well, you know, they must know it already,
[02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:33.680]   and I'm trying to be the good guy in the room
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:34.900]   with the patient, convince them
[02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:36.340]   to use their other medications.
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:40.340]   But it's important for us also as eye care providers
[02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:42.780]   to reinforce the message with our patients,
[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:47.680]   a smoking, terrible idea for macular degeneration,
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:49.300]   also for glaucoma.
[02:29:49.300 --> 02:29:50.700]   You know, glaucoma is interesting
[02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:52.960]   because the optic nerve where it degenerates,
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:54.700]   kind of right at the head of the optic nerve
[02:29:54.700 --> 02:29:56.820]   where it exits the eye,
[02:29:56.820 --> 02:29:58.500]   it's what we call a watershed zone.
[02:29:58.500 --> 02:30:02.940]   It's kind of the edge of two blood vessel supplies.
[02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:05.380]   And if either of those blood vessel supplies
[02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:08.680]   are a little bit short on blood or oxygen supply
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:10.320]   to that optic nerve head,
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:11.980]   your glaucoma is gonna get worse.
[02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:13.980]   Your optic nerve's gonna be underfed,
[02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:16.400]   and that's gonna worsen this degenerative process
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:19.580]   just by not having all the right nutrients and oxygen.
[02:30:19.580 --> 02:30:22.900]   So the other thing is that, especially for glaucoma,
[02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:26.180]   everything that we talk about for being heart healthy
[02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:28.620]   for the rest of our body
[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:31.940]   is almost certainly true for glaucoma.
[02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:34.780]   And so I also always counsel glaucoma patients.
[02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:37.860]   It's not just no smoking, but eat healthy,
[02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:41.340]   have a multivitamin, get some exercise,
[02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:44.420]   all those things that are good for your cardiovascular system
[02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:46.060]   are gonna be good for your eyes in general,
[02:30:46.060 --> 02:30:49.540]   and in particular, if you have glaucoma
[02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:52.540]   or are at high risk for glaucoma.
[02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:55.820]   - I realize that smoking or vaping are problematic
[02:30:55.820 --> 02:30:58.800]   for glaucoma and for macular degeneration,
[02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:00.820]   but we can't have a conversation about glaucoma
[02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:03.060]   without at least mentioning cannabis.
[02:31:03.060 --> 02:31:04.900]   I did an entire episode about cannabis,
[02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:07.020]   which touched on some of the real dangers
[02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:09.820]   of very high THC concentration in cannabis.
[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:14.080]   This lost me a few followers, I'm sure, no problem,
[02:31:14.080 --> 02:31:16.720]   because what was important was to convey the fact
[02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:20.220]   that the cannabis that's out there nowadays
[02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:22.000]   comes in a variety of different strains
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.760]   and ratios of THC to CBD.
[02:31:24.760 --> 02:31:27.560]   There's some severe risks of high THC,
[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:30.840]   especially in young males, although not always.
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:33.140]   The point being that there are,
[02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:34.320]   and I want to be very clear about this,
[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:35.460]   because for whatever reason,
[02:31:35.460 --> 02:31:37.160]   cannabis gets people really up in arms.
[02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:38.620]   They always say it's not as bad as alcohol,
[02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:40.760]   but guess what we did an entire episode about alcohol?
[02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:42.060]   And there, the message is very clear.
[02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:43.380]   Zero is better than any,
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:45.380]   and two a week is probably the limit.
[02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:47.780]   And if you're an alcoholic, zero is the rule.
[02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:52.780]   So with cannabis, it's clear by my read of the data
[02:31:52.780 --> 02:31:56.360]   that it can lower eye pressure,
[02:31:56.360 --> 02:31:59.660]   which may undermine the progression of glaucoma somewhat.
[02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:01.700]   But if people are smoking that cannabis,
[02:32:01.700 --> 02:32:04.020]   is it therefore going to offset any gain
[02:32:04.020 --> 02:32:06.580]   that one would get from that cannabis?
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:09.060]   And then how does one account for the potentially
[02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:12.580]   problematic aspects of very high THC cannabis?
[02:32:12.580 --> 02:32:14.060]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:16.660]   And the truth is, is that in most patients,
[02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:19.940]   cannabis will lower the eye pressure.
[02:32:19.940 --> 02:32:23.460]   The problem is, is it really only lowers that eye pressure
[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:26.620]   during the period that you're high from the cannabis.
[02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:30.180]   And the second problem is that smoking version
[02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:32.780]   of getting that cannabis into your system,
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:35.020]   the smoking is bad for your lungs.
[02:32:35.020 --> 02:32:38.700]   By the way, the smoke from cannabis or from cigarettes
[02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:42.020]   is also terrible for your dry eyes.
[02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:45.260]   It causes inflammation, it dries out your eyes.
[02:32:45.260 --> 02:32:48.220]   So it's also very bad from that perspective.
[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:50.580]   Now, so the problem with cannabis
[02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:52.500]   is not that it doesn't work to lower the,
[02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:54.500]   we wanna lower the pressure, that's great.
[02:32:54.500 --> 02:32:57.460]   The problem with cannabis is that it's not realistic
[02:32:57.460 --> 02:33:00.800]   for most of our patients to prescribe,
[02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:03.340]   could you go out and be high from cannabis
[02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:07.140]   24 hours a day, seven days a week for the next 20 years?
[02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:10.220]   - I'm sure some people have tried and succeeded,
[02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:12.800]   but right, that's not practical for most people.
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:14.000]   And certainly for young people,
[02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.300]   it could be really especially problematic, I should say.
[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:20.380]   - Absolutely, so I recommend not taking that approach.
[02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:23.240]   But that said, I'm definitely not a decryer of it.
[02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:25.780]   And now that there are edible forms,
[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:28.580]   I certainly have patients who are using it
[02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:33.260]   in a responsible way, especially edible forms.
[02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:36.860]   And in select cases like that could make the difference
[02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:38.640]   for them helping to keep the pressure down.
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:40.980]   And I'll say, for example, you know, it turns out,
[02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:43.740]   you've talked a lot over the last couple of years
[02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:46.980]   about diurnal curves and circadian rhythms.
[02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:49.420]   It turns out that our eye pressure
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:51.740]   also undergoes a circadian rhythm.
[02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:54.960]   And it's actually highest at night while we're sleeping,
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:57.020]   kind of peaks in those early morning hours,
[02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:59.220]   then hits a low throughout the early day,
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:01.460]   and then kind of rises again throughout the afternoon
[02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:02.940]   into the evening.
[02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:04.420]   And we have a lot of patients
[02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:05.820]   who they come into their clinic visit,
[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:07.420]   their eye pressure looks normal,
[02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:09.600]   but it's actually quite a bit higher when they're at home.
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:12.020]   And that could explain some fraction
[02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:14.240]   of what we call normal pressure glaucoma.
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:15.420]   It just looks normal during the day.
[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:17.100]   It's actually high at night.
[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:19.300]   And so in particular, some patients,
[02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:22.540]   I certainly have some patients who are using these products
[02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:24.340]   like let's say before bed.
[02:34:24.340 --> 02:34:27.140]   And if it's controlling their eye pressure at night
[02:34:27.140 --> 02:34:27.960]   while they're asleep,
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:29.980]   when the eye pressure would have been the highest,
[02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:33.900]   it may confer some protective advantage over time.
[02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:35.940]   But that said, again, like for most patients,
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:37.780]   it's not gonna be the primary approach.
[02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:41.940]   I'm most excited about the idea of, you know,
[02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:44.260]   laboratories or companies figuring out
[02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:49.260]   which the compounds within these cannabinoids,
[02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:51.660]   they're called, within these products
[02:34:51.660 --> 02:34:55.300]   are actually responsible for lowering the eye pressure.
[02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:59.340]   And could we get like a more potent eye specific
[02:34:59.340 --> 02:35:03.320]   long acting drug that's basically derived
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:05.280]   from the concept of cannabis,
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:07.820]   but works better and is more compatible
[02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:11.300]   with not bringing along all the other adverse elements
[02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:12.980]   that can come with cannabis use.
[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:16.820]   - You mentioned the circadian rhythm in eye pressure
[02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:20.100]   and the fact that eye pressure is higher at night.
[02:35:20.100 --> 02:35:24.060]   Is there any advantage to sleeping in a particular position?
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:25.420]   I know this might sound a little detailed,
[02:35:25.420 --> 02:35:28.220]   but I seem to recall an abstract or a paper a few years ago
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:30.620]   at a meeting that you and I both attended
[02:35:30.620 --> 02:35:32.540]   that said that if people slept with their head
[02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:35.060]   below their feet, eye pressures were higher
[02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:37.300]   than if their head was slightly elevated above their feet.
[02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:38.900]   And for somebody who has glaucoma,
[02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:41.060]   this could make pretty substantial difference
[02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:42.140]   in terms of their eye pressures
[02:35:42.140 --> 02:35:45.740]   at precisely the hours of the night, we should say,
[02:35:45.740 --> 02:35:47.820]   in which they could be doing the most damage
[02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:48.900]   to the ganglion cells.
[02:35:48.900 --> 02:35:50.800]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:54.500]   And we will sometimes counsel patients with severe glaucoma,
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:56.100]   especially if they're, you know,
[02:35:56.100 --> 02:35:58.940]   poorly responsive to standard therapies
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:02.060]   or poorly able to tolerate standard therapies,
[02:36:02.060 --> 02:36:04.420]   we'll counsel them if they're able to sleep up
[02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:05.500]   on a couple of pillows,
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:08.340]   get kind of a 30 degree sleep angle going.
[02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:11.920]   What I don't want to do is interfere with a person's sleep
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:15.420]   because I just, I fundamentally feel for the total health
[02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:17.860]   of the whole human being,
[02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:20.900]   getting a good night's sleep is maybe more important
[02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:21.920]   than that 30 degrees.
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:24.420]   And if trying to sleep up on pillows at 30 degrees
[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:27.940]   is going to lead to kind of restless, difficult sleep night,
[02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:31.240]   I'd rather the patient get a good night's sleep.
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:32.780]   But if they can tolerate it,
[02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:35.500]   and especially if they have a sort of a tough version
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:38.900]   of glaucoma, then we'll let them try,
[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:40.440]   see if they can sleep up.
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:43.060]   The other really interesting question that arises
[02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:46.540]   is does which side you sleep on affect
[02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:49.260]   which eye might have worse glaucoma?
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:52.920]   Glaucoma is almost always, with a few rare exceptions,
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:55.520]   almost always a disease of two eyes,
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.660]   but it can present very asymmetrically.
[02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:59.900]   In fact, it's quite common to have one eye
[02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:01.880]   kind of have worse damage than the other.
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:04.300]   And we don't know fundamentally why that is,
[02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:06.360]   but one hypothesis was, gosh,
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:09.280]   maybe if you sleep on the right eye,
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:11.360]   then your right eye will have worse glaucoma
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:14.180]   'cause the pressure's a little higher down below,
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:17.100]   or maybe it's pressing on the pillow in a way
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:18.620]   or something like that.
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:19.900]   There have been a couple studies
[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:22.560]   really looking at that question,
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:23.820]   a couple studies have said
[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:26.060]   the lower eye will have worse glaucoma,
[02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:27.020]   a couple studies have said
[02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:29.140]   the higher eye will have worse glaucoma.
[02:37:29.140 --> 02:37:31.280]   So the upshot is it probably doesn't matter
[02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:32.500]   which side you sleep on.
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:34.540]   We also know when you video people
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:36.100]   in their normal sleep pattern,
[02:37:36.100 --> 02:37:38.440]   even if you feel you always fall asleep
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:40.500]   on the left side of your face,
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:42.260]   people toss and turn all night,
[02:37:42.260 --> 02:37:43.460]   probably over the course of the night,
[02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:46.420]   you're spending a similar amount of time on each eye.
[02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:49.100]   - I'm glad you brought up that point.
[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:51.280]   In terms of macular degeneration,
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:53.940]   I'm curious about the things that people can do
[02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:55.260]   as opposed to the don'ts
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:58.260]   in order to perhaps offset macular degeneration.
[02:37:58.260 --> 02:37:59.500]   One of the things that I'm intrigued by
[02:37:59.500 --> 02:38:01.600]   are the results of Glenn Jeffrey's laboratory
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:03.280]   over at University College London.
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:06.740]   I had known Jeff for probably a decade or more
[02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:09.280]   and he typically worked on animal models,
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:11.480]   but then a few years ago started publishing studies.
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:13.620]   And I believe there are now two published studies
[02:38:13.620 --> 02:38:16.420]   showing how red light exposure
[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:19.540]   and near infrared light exposure
[02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:21.800]   done early in the day to the eye
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:23.560]   at a distance of about two feet
[02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:26.420]   for just a couple of minutes a few times a week
[02:38:26.420 --> 02:38:29.260]   could offset some of the vision loss
[02:38:29.260 --> 02:38:31.500]   associated with age-related macular degeneration
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:33.240]   in people older than 40.
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:34.680]   That's my understanding of these studies.
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:35.620]   And there's a theory there
[02:38:35.620 --> 02:38:38.580]   about enhancing function of mitochondria and photoreceptors
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:40.420]   by reducing reactive oxygen species.
[02:38:40.420 --> 02:38:42.520]   There's a whole mechanistic hypothesis.
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:45.220]   But my question is,
[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:46.840]   is that the sort of protocol
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:50.180]   that produces significant enough offset
[02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:51.480]   of macular degeneration,
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:54.500]   like we should all be looking at red lights in the morning,
[02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:56.900]   or is it still too early days
[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:58.800]   in order to really conclude that?
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:02.400]   - I think the data is very compelling.
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:04.600]   The data are very compelling
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:08.540]   that this kind of red or near infrared light therapy
[02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:10.920]   can be at some level neuroprotective.
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:15.000]   And yes, the data suggest that
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.120]   the kind of ramping up high functioning mitochondria
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:20.520]   is a part of that,
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:23.640]   activating neuroprotective pathways in the retina.
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:26.600]   It's actually been demonstrated in animal models
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:28.600]   and a little human data here and there,
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:32.680]   but both for macular degeneration kind of degenerative disease
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:35.280]   but also for optic neuropathies,
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:37.840]   like glaucoma and retinal ganglion cells,
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:40.040]   the cells that carry all that visual information
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:41.240]   from the eye to the brain.
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:43.800]   They're chock full of mitochondria too.
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:48.320]   And so the idea that this could be a therapeutic approach,
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:49.800]   I think is very compelling.
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:50.900]   There are a number of studies,
[02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:53.800]   actually I think still ongoing today,
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:56.240]   really trying to figure out what's the right dose,
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:58.160]   how much brightness do you need?
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:39:59.720]   Is there an optimal wavelength?
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:00.620]   How many minutes?
[02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:05.100]   Does it matter when during the day you provide that light
[02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:07.100]   or how many minutes or hours?
[02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:10.960]   These are still very much open questions.
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:11.800]   What's the dose?
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:13.040]   What's the delivery?
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.340]   But it's very promising looking
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:19.160]   and there's biological premise
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:21.040]   and I'm excited to see where that goes
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:25.480]   because again, that's a very accessible
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:28.480]   sort of therapeutic approach that could be brought
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:31.040]   to a very broad swath of people.
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:33.080]   So I'm excited about that.
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:34.240]   - Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:35.720]   and completely noninvasive.
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:39.360]   I should probably mention a warning,
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:41.200]   which is if people are going to decide
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:42.960]   that they're going to jump on this result
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:45.680]   and do red light exposure in the early part of the day,
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:47.500]   no matter what color a light is,
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:49.980]   if it's too bright, you can damage your eye.
[02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:51.920]   So I think this is why you're pointing to the fact
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:54.920]   that we need established protocols
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:56.940]   before people really start blasting their eyes
[02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:57.780]   with red light.
[02:40:57.780 --> 02:40:59.600]   And if they are going to expose themselves to red light,
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:01.480]   it shouldn't be uncomfortably bright.
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:02.320]   Do I have that correct?
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:03.640]   - Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:06.200]   Actually light effect,
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:08.240]   we talked about this a little bit earlier,
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:12.060]   there's actually now data also that red light
[02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:15.200]   and actually interestingly studies using light
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:18.360]   at the other end of the visible spectrum, violet light,
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:21.800]   either of those in small daily doses
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:26.060]   can also be used to prevent progression of nearsightedness
[02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:28.440]   in children, in school-aged children.
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:31.160]   And so I think we're really just on the cusp
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:33.120]   of really understanding the biology
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:35.840]   of how these different light therapies
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:40.840]   might be leveraged maximally to maximize our eye health.
[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:42.760]   And both during development
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:46.480]   and at the other end of the spectrum as we age.
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:48.000]   So it's an exciting area.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.240]   And I think this kind of photo therapy is, you know,
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:55.280]   a very hot topic for research right now, very hot topic.
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:57.600]   - One has to wonder whether or not these light therapies,
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:01.320]   the fact that infrared works and maybe ultraviolet works
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:05.240]   are really just capturing some of what sunlight
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:08.640]   is naturally doing when, as you mentioned before,
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:10.840]   a child or perhaps an adult also spends
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:12.220]   a certain number of hours outdoors.
[02:42:12.220 --> 02:42:14.020]   I mean, maybe we were just filling in the blanks
[02:42:14.020 --> 02:42:15.480]   that are neglected nowadays
[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:17.140]   because we're spending so much time indoors
[02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:19.100]   under artificial lights and in front of screens.
[02:42:19.100 --> 02:42:22.840]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a very thoughtful possibility, yeah.
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:24.880]   - I have a couple of,
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:26.280]   we don't have to call them quick questions,
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:31.280]   but common questions that perhaps have brief explanations.
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:36.020]   For instance, I put out a request for questions
[02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:37.520]   in anticipation of this episode,
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:42.180]   and I got a lot of people asking what are floaters in the eye
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:43.520]   and is there anything that people can do
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:45.080]   to get rid of floaters?
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:48.440]   - Yeah, our eye when we're born is actually filled
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:50.320]   in the middle of it with a jelly.
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:52.220]   It's not just fluid, it's kind of a jelly.
[02:42:52.220 --> 02:42:54.080]   There's collagen fibers,
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:57.960]   and thankfully the whole jelly is largely invisible,
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:00.740]   so the light can get through our eye back to the retina
[02:43:00.740 --> 02:43:02.540]   without being impeded.
[02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:06.520]   As we age, those different fibers and gels
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:11.320]   shrink and contract and they peel off
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:13.360]   of the back of the retina, so there's just in the middle.
[02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:15.560]   Now your eyeball doesn't shrink
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:19.600]   because it fills in with fluid, with saltwater basically,
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:21.400]   but the gel part shrinks.
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:26.120]   And as it shrinks and also pulls, peels off the retina,
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:28.960]   it can pull off kind of little tiny retinal bits,
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:31.000]   not important to your vision bits,
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.520]   but just like little tissue bits.
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:34.080]   And also as it congeals,
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:38.080]   it kind of can get little concretions in the jelly,
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:40.780]   and we perceive those as floaters,
[02:43:40.780 --> 02:43:43.080]   you know, little almost semi-translucent
[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:46.200]   or in some cases kind of grayish, blackish.
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:48.000]   Sometimes you get a big one
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.180]   if it peels off the edge of the optic nerve
[02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:51.960]   in the back of the eye as happens.
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:54.720]   We call that a posterior vitreous detachment.
[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:56.040]   You can actually see like a moon
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:59.240]   or a half moon floater in your vision.
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:04.240]   These are very frustrating to a lot of people.
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:08.200]   And the good news is in almost all cases,
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:10.400]   they will just go away by themselves.
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:12.480]   In theory, it's been played with,
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:15.000]   gosh, we could do like a big surgery
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.380]   to chew up all that jelly, replace it all with saltwater,
[02:44:18.380 --> 02:44:20.360]   try to get rid of your floaters.
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:22.380]   There's risk associated with that surgery.
[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:25.640]   We use it very effectively in our retinal detachments
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:28.760]   or other diseases, bad diabetic retinopathy,
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:30.240]   bleeding inside the eye.
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:32.000]   We can take out the jelly from the eye,
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.840]   replace it with saltwater,
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:37.540]   but that's not, you know,
[02:44:37.540 --> 02:44:40.080]   putting patients through the risk of that surgery
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:42.680]   just to get rid of a couple of floaters or a few floaters
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:46.880]   that probably are gonna go away over the next few months.
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:49.440]   I actually like to tell patients,
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:52.520]   it's nothing to worry about, just ignore them.
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:55.200]   And actually, if you stop focusing on them,
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:57.960]   your brain will actually start filtering them out.
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:00.120]   You'll stop noticing them
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:03.120]   if you can kind of not worry about them,
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:06.240]   be a little intentional about ignoring them in the beginning
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:07.720]   and then they do actually go away.
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:09.200]   And look, some will go away.
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:10.180]   These three will go away.
[02:45:10.180 --> 02:45:11.600]   These two will appear.
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:14.400]   Eventually, you'll stop having floaters.
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:17.280]   Most patients will stop having floaters.
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:20.240]   So we really don't like to put a patient at risk
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:21.600]   by intervening.
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:23.840]   We really like to, in this case, just reassure them.
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:25.120]   It's gonna be okay.
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:26.160]   Just ignore them.
[02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:27.540]   They'll eventually go away.
[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:29.300]   - Thank you for that answer.
[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:33.980]   Twitching of the eye is something that people complain about.
[02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:37.240]   I know when I get tired, I'll get a twitch over one eye.
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:40.380]   I think there's a condition, is it called myasthenia gravis,
[02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:42.480]   where people go through a stressful period
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:43.460]   or get very fatigued.
[02:45:43.460 --> 02:45:44.820]   And I think that's a depletion
[02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:47.420]   of the nerve terminal communication
[02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:50.180]   between the nerves that control the muscles of the eye
[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:53.260]   and then people get this kind of like hooded eye look
[02:45:53.260 --> 02:45:55.940]   where they have a hard time opening their eyes.
[02:45:55.940 --> 02:45:59.400]   But barring something extreme like myasthenia gravis
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:02.120]   or staying up for two days working
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:04.740]   or even just being a bit sleep deprived,
[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:06.780]   what causes the twitching of the eyelid?
[02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:09.140]   And is there anything people can do about that?
[02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:12.420]   - Most of the time, it's actually just a bad nerve ending.
[02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:14.820]   Maybe that one nerve cell.
[02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:18.580]   Your eyelid is fed by hundreds,
[02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:20.700]   maybe it's thousands of nerve cells
[02:46:20.700 --> 02:46:22.900]   that are doing the muscles, they're doing the feeling.
[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:25.140]   Obviously, it's the ones controlling the muscles
[02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:26.200]   that can lead to a twitch.
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:29.860]   If one of those nerve cells kind of just starts,
[02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:32.960]   maybe that one nerve cell is dying, just whatever,
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:36.980]   the aging process, it happens in young people too though.
[02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:40.260]   So you got one bad fiber
[02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:43.460]   that's just deciding to kind of ring off the hook.
[02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:45.300]   That telephone's just ringing off the hook
[02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:47.340]   and it's just activating the muscle.
[02:46:47.340 --> 02:46:49.820]   So you're just twitching that muscle.
[02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:51.120]   I've had them as well.
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:52.580]   And you can have them not just in your eyelids,
[02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:54.380]   you can have this anywhere in your body,
[02:46:54.380 --> 02:46:57.060]   like one little spot on your leg
[02:46:57.060 --> 02:46:59.500]   where just the muscle right under the skin
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:01.860]   is just ch ch ch ch ch.
[02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:04.420]   And typically it'll happen over the course
[02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:07.820]   of a couple of months intermittently,
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:09.160]   some days more, some days less,
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:10.780]   maybe it correlates with when you're tired
[02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:13.840]   a little bit sometimes, and then it'll stop.
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:16.460]   That nerve cell will either reconnect properly
[02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:19.900]   and stop doing that, maybe it dies, we don't really know.
[02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:22.380]   But typically it lasts on that scale.
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:25.740]   Now, there are other diseases, not just myasthenia gravis.
[02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:27.460]   You can have blepharospasm,
[02:47:27.460 --> 02:47:29.860]   like where you have a chronic spasming
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:34.740]   of certain nerves causing muscles to spasm.
[02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:37.800]   And there we can use treatments, for example,
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:41.340]   Botox is a treatment that people use
[02:47:41.340 --> 02:47:44.540]   for cosmetic reducing of wrinkles, for example.
[02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:47.740]   But a really good medical use of Botox
[02:47:47.740 --> 02:47:49.660]   is preventing that blepharospasm.
[02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:52.540]   And patients can come in once every three or six months
[02:47:52.540 --> 02:47:55.700]   if they have a really severe spasming version
[02:47:55.700 --> 02:47:56.820]   of what you're describing.
[02:47:56.820 --> 02:47:59.300]   But the regular occasional run of the mill
[02:47:59.300 --> 02:48:01.900]   lasts a couple months, nothing to worry about.
[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:05.820]   It does not presage anything bad happening in your future.
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:08.920]   And maybe let it run its course and you'll be okay.
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:09.760]   - Great.
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:14.620]   We've all heard that carrots are good for our vision,
[02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:18.300]   which presumably stems from some peripheral understanding
[02:48:18.300 --> 02:48:21.260]   about the fact that vitamin A is integral
[02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:24.140]   to the photosynthesis pathway of converting light
[02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:25.800]   into electrical and chemical signals
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:28.220]   that the rest of the eye and brain can use.
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:30.340]   And yet I'm guessing that there probably aren't
[02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:31.760]   that many people walking around
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:33.060]   who are vitamin A deficient.
[02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:35.140]   They're probably out there, but not that many,
[02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:36.840]   especially in developed countries.
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:41.380]   And in addition, in the last really five years,
[02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:43.540]   but in particular in the last two years,
[02:48:43.540 --> 02:48:46.800]   I've seen a proliferation of supplements on the market
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:50.160]   to promote eye health and longevity of vision.
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:53.840]   I'd love your thought on this general theme
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:58.320]   of nutrition and supplements for improving eye health
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:00.380]   or for maintaining eye health.
[02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:01.920]   And before we started recording,
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:05.480]   you mentioned that ophthalmology or at least eye health
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:09.140]   is one area of medicine that has a bit, not extensive,
[02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:13.160]   but a bit of a longer history of exploring supplementation
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:16.420]   in rigorous randomized controlled trials.
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:20.000]   Whereas other areas of neuroscience and neural health,
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:21.940]   such as Alzheimer's, et cetera,
[02:49:21.940 --> 02:49:24.020]   certainly there are brain health supplements out there,
[02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:25.900]   but there aren't a lot of rigorous data
[02:49:25.900 --> 02:49:27.320]   to support them just yet.
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:29.740]   So what are your thoughts on nutrition?
[02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:32.560]   Aside from the standard thing of people shouldn't be
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:34.940]   ingesting too many calories such that they are obese
[02:49:34.940 --> 02:49:37.000]   and diabetic and therefore, et cetera,
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.740]   indirect effects of nutrition,
[02:49:39.740 --> 02:49:42.320]   what are your thoughts on nutrition and supplementation
[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:43.980]   for eye health?
[02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:46.220]   - Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:47.400]   And again, in ophthalmology,
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:49.460]   we actually do have quite a bit of studies.
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:51.600]   There's been quite a bit of attention over the years,
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:54.200]   even over the decades, looking at this question.
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:57.360]   And I think it's worth highlighting a couple of yeses
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:49:59.440]   and a couple of nos.
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:01.760]   For macular degeneration, which we talked about
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:05.680]   being an exceedingly common cause of vision loss,
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:10.680]   there have been two age-related eye disease studies
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:13.840]   called ARIDS, age-related eye disease studies, ARIDS.
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:16.160]   There was ARIDS and then ARIDS 2.
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.720]   And those studies were large, randomized trials
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:24.500]   of giving patients supplements.
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:28.440]   And in ARIDS, it was vitamin C and E,
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:30.940]   higher dose than would just come in a multivitamin,
[02:50:30.940 --> 02:50:36.940]   zinc and copper, and then also beta carotene.
[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:39.080]   And beta carotene is one of these
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:40.960]   what are called carotenoids.
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:42.560]   If you look at the extended family,
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:46.000]   there's maybe 600 different chemical entities
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.720]   of these carotenoids, and beta carotene is one of them
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:51.440]   that's in the direct pathway of making vitamin A.
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:54.000]   And so that was the principle in the ARIDS study.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.660]   And the ARIDS study showed that patients
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:00.180]   randomized to these pills compared to controls,
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:03.680]   these are antioxidants in part, right,
[02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:06.800]   in addition to feeding into that vitamin A pathway.
[02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:11.800]   And the patients randomized to get that supplement mixture
[02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:16.800]   showed less progression of their dry macular degeneration
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:19.200]   in the moderate to severe ranges.
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:21.340]   If you had mild macular degeneration,
[02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:24.480]   they didn't show a statistically significant improvement,
[02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:26.880]   but I will say it's my experience,
[02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:30.040]   myself with patients and seeing how the field works.
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:31.880]   You know, if you have mild macular degeneration,
[02:51:31.880 --> 02:51:33.700]   even though it's not as clinically proven,
[02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:35.080]   we're still often recommending,
[02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:37.720]   hey, if you can afford that supplement,
[02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:39.040]   go ahead and buy that.
[02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:42.760]   Now, ARIDS was then followed by a second study, ARIDS-2.
[02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:47.120]   Also with vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and copper,
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:49.880]   they actually tested whether a slightly lower dose of zinc
[02:51:49.880 --> 02:51:51.320]   would be as good as a higher dose,
[02:51:51.320 --> 02:51:53.920]   and a lower dose was as good as a higher dose.
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:56.120]   And then instead of the beta carotene,
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:57.800]   they tested against the beta carotene,
[02:51:57.800 --> 02:52:00.840]   they tried two other carotenoids
[02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:03.640]   that are called lutein and zeaxanthin.
[02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:08.540]   And they actually found head to head that the second,
[02:52:08.540 --> 02:52:11.440]   the ARIDS-2 formula without the beta carotene
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:14.040]   and with the lutein and zeaxanthin,
[02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:17.160]   that that formula was even better
[02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:20.280]   at slowing dry macular degeneration
[02:52:20.280 --> 02:52:22.100]   in the moderate to severe population.
[02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:24.480]   Again, it's not clear how much it may help
[02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:26.080]   mild macular degeneration,
[02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:29.080]   but in the sort of clinically defined
[02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:30.960]   moderate towards severe group,
[02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:32.760]   there was a statistically significant,
[02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:36.740]   it reduced it by about 20, 25% the progression
[02:52:36.740 --> 02:52:38.600]   of your dry macular degeneration.
[02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:41.600]   And, you know, over a couple of years, 25%,
[02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:44.160]   you may not notice, but over a couple of decades,
[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:46.280]   you know, that could really slow down
[02:52:46.280 --> 02:52:48.520]   the progression of your disease.
[02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:51.280]   Now, it turns out that the beta carotene,
[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:54.440]   they noted a little bit of an increased cancer risk
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:57.440]   in the patients in the ARIDS-1 who had that beta carotene,
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:53:00.360]   mostly in patients who were smokers.
[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:02.620]   They also noticed in the second one
[02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:05.680]   that if you were already not taking a multivitamin
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:09.760]   or not eating a diet that's already naturally rich
[02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:11.640]   in lutein or zeaxanthin,
[02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:15.400]   that the effect of that supplement was even stronger.
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:19.580]   So it was very strong clinical trial support
[02:53:19.580 --> 02:53:24.260]   for taking what we now use this ARIDS-2 supplementation,
[02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:26.260]   and I'm sure we can list the formula
[02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:29.300]   or put it in the links under your podcast,
[02:53:29.300 --> 02:53:34.280]   that this really does slow macular degeneration.
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:36.980]   So that's like a very strong example
[02:53:36.980 --> 02:53:39.680]   of a yes, you should do this.
[02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:44.680]   There's one yes brewing in the glaucoma field right now,
[02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:49.720]   and that's high-dose vitamin B3, B as in boy three.
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:51.760]   It's also called, in its various forms,
[02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:55.600]   either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide.
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:58.440]   The nicotin sounds like nicotine,
[02:53:58.440 --> 02:54:01.840]   but this is not a substitute for smoking or vaping.
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:03.580]   This is a different, this is a vitamin
[02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:05.640]   that just has a very similar sounding name.
[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:07.860]   - It's in the NAD synthesis pathway, correct?
[02:54:07.860 --> 02:54:08.860]   - That's exactly right.
[02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:10.220]   It's in the NAD pathway.
[02:54:10.220 --> 02:54:14.240]   NAD is one of the oxidative stress regulators
[02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:16.660]   and energy regulators of our cells.
[02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:18.940]   So it's a very critical molecule
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:20.980]   in the metabolism of our cells.
[02:54:20.980 --> 02:54:22.940]   And there was very strong evidence
[02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:26.720]   in preclinical models of mice, given glaucoma,
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:28.660]   that manipulating this pathway
[02:54:28.660 --> 02:54:31.300]   and sort of increasing this pathway
[02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:35.580]   could be protective in glaucoma or other optic neuropathies,
[02:54:35.580 --> 02:54:38.500]   optic nerve degenerative diseases.
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:42.260]   And so there have now been two limited,
[02:54:42.260 --> 02:54:45.480]   but randomized controlled clinical trials,
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:47.300]   one looking at glaucoma patients,
[02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:48.620]   looking at their visual field,
[02:54:48.620 --> 02:54:50.700]   so their actual visual performance,
[02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:53.740]   and the other looking at the electrical signals in the eye
[02:54:53.740 --> 02:54:55.380]   called an electoretinogram,
[02:54:55.380 --> 02:54:57.340]   kind of like an EEG does for your brain.
[02:54:57.340 --> 02:55:00.580]   We can do an ERG for your retina.
[02:55:00.580 --> 02:55:02.940]   And in both of those trials,
[02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:07.940]   high dose vitamin B3 was A, found to be very safe.
[02:55:07.940 --> 02:55:11.240]   And B was shown to actually improve,
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:14.360]   at least in the short term, improve retinal function,
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:16.700]   measured either on visual field testing
[02:55:16.700 --> 02:55:19.860]   or on the electoretinogram.
[02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:24.620]   Now, this is now entering clinical trials,
[02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:28.900]   large kind of phase three style clinical trials,
[02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:30.060]   actually around the world.
[02:55:30.060 --> 02:55:32.420]   It's a very hot topic for glaucoma,
[02:55:32.420 --> 02:55:35.900]   the fact that this NAD boosting supplementation
[02:55:35.900 --> 02:55:39.100]   with high dose vitamin B3 might be a great approach
[02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:43.700]   to helping protect the nerve in glaucoma.
[02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:47.200]   And so, as I say, there's three or four large,
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:52.180]   randomized phase three style clinical trials starting now.
[02:55:52.180 --> 02:55:55.820]   And so over the next year or two, we'll get more data.
[02:55:55.820 --> 02:55:58.620]   But I'll tell you, I have patients,
[02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:01.020]   and if they're at the end of their rope
[02:56:01.020 --> 02:56:02.580]   and we are having a lot of trouble
[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:05.580]   controlling their vision loss from glaucoma,
[02:56:05.580 --> 02:56:08.860]   I'm already recommending in these limited cases,
[02:56:08.860 --> 02:56:10.720]   hey, why don't you try this?
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:15.260]   It's almost certainly safe and it may help,
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:17.540]   and it may help protect your vision over time.
[02:56:17.540 --> 02:56:20.340]   So that's an area that's kind of another,
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:22.620]   like kind of could be a yes.
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:25.000]   Early data's pointing in the right direction.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.000]   You want to be careful, but I am starting to recommend it
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.460]   at the same time that we're actually doing
[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:34.180]   the clinical trials.
[02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:36.480]   Now, that said, there are a lot of other things
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:39.380]   that people talk about, other supplements,
[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:43.580]   gingko biloba, things with generic names on the internet,
[02:56:43.580 --> 02:56:47.360]   like, you know, glaucoma preservation, you know, yeah.
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:50.300]   - That sort of thing makes my, gives me hives, you know.
[02:56:50.300 --> 02:56:53.620]   - Yeah, and these are areas where there might be
[02:56:53.620 --> 02:56:57.820]   scientific premise, like a plausible explanation
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:57:01.060]   for how this should help, but not good data
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:02.760]   that it actually helps.
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:05.940]   Thankfully, in most cases, these things are safe,
[02:57:05.940 --> 02:57:09.980]   but I just worry about patients hitching their wagon
[02:57:09.980 --> 02:57:11.760]   to something that's not gonna help them,
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:15.380]   getting their hopes up, worst case scenario,
[02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:18.900]   not taking their actually proven prescribed treatments
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:21.160]   and instead using an alternative therapy
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:23.480]   that doesn't have data to support it.
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:26.740]   And so I think there, there's a lot of, you know,
[02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:33.620]   either unfounded, unsupported, you know, information.
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:37.060]   It travels around chat rooms, travels around the internet.
[02:57:37.060 --> 02:57:39.380]   One person tells the next person, you know,
[02:57:39.380 --> 02:57:43.020]   there's inappropriate advertising for some of these.
[02:57:43.020 --> 02:57:45.740]   And there, you know, I really don't want patients
[02:57:45.740 --> 02:57:49.060]   to be hurt, not necessarily hurt by taking something
[02:57:49.060 --> 02:57:51.880]   that's not helping, but maybe hurt by feeling like,
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:53.220]   ah, I don't have to go to the doctor.
[02:57:53.220 --> 02:57:54.520]   I'm taking this supplement.
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:57.780]   And that would be obviously a really bad potential outcome
[02:57:57.780 --> 02:57:58.800]   for a patient.
[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:00.160]   - Yeah, I completely agree.
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:03.020]   Supplements are, just as the name suggests,
[02:58:03.020 --> 02:58:08.020]   a supplement to an already hopefully healthy lifestyle
[02:58:08.020 --> 02:58:10.780]   and use of medication where it's prescribed.
[02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:13.260]   And I've often said on the podcast
[02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:15.900]   that sometimes the best dose of a supplement
[02:58:15.900 --> 02:58:18.460]   is zero milligrams.
[02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:20.520]   So I do appreciate you touching on those themes
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:22.660]   because supplementation is something
[02:58:22.660 --> 02:58:25.060]   that comes up from time to time on the podcast.
[02:58:25.060 --> 02:58:27.500]   And I know that I've certainly have seen a number
[02:58:27.500 --> 02:58:30.340]   of these different eye and vision support supplements.
[02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:33.020]   We aren't affiliated with any of them.
[02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:34.840]   I don't personally take any of them,
[02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:38.020]   but these clinical trials sound promising.
[02:58:38.020 --> 02:58:42.120]   So I'm going to keep an ear to the ground for them.
[02:58:42.120 --> 02:58:46.380]   As a final question, and hopefully a topic
[02:58:46.380 --> 02:58:47.780]   that we can cover in more detail
[02:58:47.780 --> 02:58:50.320]   in a subsequent episode of the podcast,
[02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:51.860]   'cause I absolutely want to have you back
[02:58:51.860 --> 02:58:53.860]   to discuss this in more detail,
[02:58:53.860 --> 02:58:55.700]   I'd like to just get your thoughts on the fact
[02:58:55.700 --> 02:58:58.260]   that the neural retina is in fact neural
[02:58:58.260 --> 02:58:59.380]   and it's part of the brain.
[02:58:59.380 --> 02:59:03.900]   And we are hearing an increasing amount of positive chatter
[02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:08.220]   about the use of imaging the eye and the retina directly
[02:59:08.220 --> 02:59:11.540]   as a way to detect other forms of neurodegeneration.
[02:59:11.540 --> 02:59:14.200]   For those that are listening or for watching,
[02:59:14.200 --> 02:59:17.920]   I'm putting my hands up in a kind of C-shape.
[02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:19.200]   At the back of your eye is lined
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:22.280]   with this three-cell layer thick thing
[02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:24.720]   that is the neural retina, which are really pieces of brain.
[02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:26.480]   They connect to the rest of the brain.
[02:59:26.480 --> 02:59:29.440]   And because it resides in the eyes
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:31.400]   and outside the cranial vault,
[02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:33.840]   people like you, skilled clinicians
[02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:36.740]   with the appropriate tools can look into the eye
[02:59:36.740 --> 02:59:38.340]   and see the brain directly
[02:59:38.340 --> 02:59:40.440]   without having to cut through the skull.
[02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:43.320]   And my understanding is that more and more,
[02:59:43.320 --> 02:59:46.540]   ophthalmologists are seeing cases
[02:59:46.540 --> 02:59:50.180]   where degeneration of the retina is correlated
[02:59:50.180 --> 02:59:53.720]   with degeneration of structures deeper in the brain,
[02:59:53.720 --> 02:59:55.740]   making imaging of the neural retina
[02:59:55.740 --> 02:59:58.160]   perhaps one of the best diagnostic tools
[02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:01.020]   for predicting and tracking the progression of Alzheimer's
[03:00:01.020 --> 03:00:02.860]   and other forms of neurodegeneration.
[03:00:02.860 --> 03:00:03.740]   Do I have that right?
[03:00:03.740 --> 03:00:04.620]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:06.820]   Actually, this is a super exciting area.
[03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:09.540]   You know, we have this long-standing saying in ophthalmology
[03:00:09.540 --> 03:00:11.140]   that the eye's a window to the brain,
[03:00:11.140 --> 03:00:12.980]   the eye's a window to the soul, of course,
[03:00:12.980 --> 03:00:14.980]   is a long-standing saying, right?
[03:00:14.980 --> 03:00:17.820]   And it turns out that, you know,
[03:00:17.820 --> 03:00:20.380]   in Alzheimer's disease, as an example,
[03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:23.820]   you know, we really talk a lot about the degeneration
[03:00:23.820 --> 03:00:26.380]   of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons
[03:00:26.380 --> 03:00:28.860]   that are leading to the cognitive deficits
[03:00:28.860 --> 03:00:30.740]   in Alzheimer's disease.
[03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:33.500]   But it turns out that there is also some degeneration
[03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:36.300]   throughout other areas of the brain, including the retina.
[03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:39.540]   And since we have such a relatively easy time
[03:00:39.540 --> 03:00:42.380]   imaging the retina, you can go into your doctor's office
[03:00:42.380 --> 03:00:46.180]   and get a quick little sort of laser scan of the retina,
[03:00:46.180 --> 03:00:48.580]   a picture of the retina, compared to like going
[03:00:48.580 --> 03:00:51.420]   through a full MRI process for your brain.
[03:00:51.420 --> 03:00:55.980]   And we can detect the degeneration of the retina
[03:00:55.980 --> 03:00:58.440]   and optic nerve associated with Alzheimer's disease.
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:00.240]   It looks like the same thing is happening
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:02.520]   in Parkinson's disease and MS.
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:05.140]   Now, one of the issues is that
[03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:07.700]   in a lot of these degenerative diseases,
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:10.120]   we're able to detect the difference in the retina,
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:12.760]   but we're not necessarily able to say,
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:16.440]   hey, if we see this in the retina, it's multiple sclerosis,
[03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:19.960]   but if we see that in the retina, it's Alzheimer's disease.
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:23.120]   So there may not be, there may be good sensitivity
[03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:25.300]   to detecting the disease and to following
[03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:28.620]   whether your brain disease is getting worse,
[03:01:28.620 --> 03:01:31.140]   but there may not be very good specificity
[03:01:31.140 --> 03:01:33.480]   differentiating the different diseases.
[03:01:33.480 --> 03:01:35.940]   And I say that with a very big asterisk
[03:01:35.940 --> 03:01:37.380]   at the end of that sentence,
[03:01:37.380 --> 03:01:41.220]   because there's actually amazingly cool new data.
[03:01:41.220 --> 03:01:44.320]   One of our colleagues who you know, Alf Dubrow,
[03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:48.660]   has helped revolutionize a new way of imaging the retina
[03:01:48.660 --> 03:01:51.760]   that's giving us now cellular resolution
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:54.300]   and even subcellular resolution,
[03:01:54.300 --> 03:01:57.560]   seeing things smaller than the sizes of cells
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:01:58.820]   inside our retina.
[03:01:58.820 --> 03:02:01.080]   And recently in one of his projects,
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:04.400]   he's teamed up with another one of our faculty, Heather Moss.
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:06.220]   She's a neuro-ophthalmologist.
[03:02:06.220 --> 03:02:08.920]   So she really specializes clinically
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:12.480]   in the eye-brain connection and her research focuses on that.
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:16.120]   And together they made actually an amazing recent discovery
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:20.760]   of very specialized, unusual, novel structures
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:23.420]   that they can detect in the retina
[03:02:23.420 --> 03:02:25.760]   of patients with multiple sclerosis.
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:28.000]   And whether these kinds of discoveries
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:29.760]   or other similar kinds of discoveries
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:33.420]   are gonna lead to kind of a whole new generation
[03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:36.660]   of biomarkers, which are ways of measuring disease,
[03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:38.420]   diagnosing who has the disease,
[03:02:38.420 --> 03:02:41.160]   figuring out who's getting worse from the disease,
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:43.220]   figuring out who's responding to therapies
[03:02:43.220 --> 03:02:45.500]   that we're trying to use to treat the diseases.
[03:02:45.500 --> 03:02:47.600]   This is a very exciting area.
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:50.400]   And this really touches on what we're all hoping
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:53.640]   is the future of eye care as well as the rest of medicine.
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:55.480]   And that's precision medicine,
[03:02:55.480 --> 03:02:57.520]   but also what we call precision health.
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:00.500]   We really wanna not just figure out what drug treatment
[03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:02.460]   to give this patient versus that treatment,
[03:03:02.460 --> 03:03:04.760]   but we really wanna figure out who's at risk
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:06.880]   of even getting some of these diseases.
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:09.400]   And gosh, we could intervene now and prevent them
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:12.200]   from ever getting in trouble in the future.
[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:13.200]   - Fantastic.
[03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:15.760]   Can't wait to hear more about those developments.
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:19.560]   And listen, I wanna say on behalf of the listeners
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:22.360]   and myself, just thank you ever so much
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:23.360]   for the discussion today.
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:26.280]   I don't think I can ever recall a conversation
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:28.940]   that's included so much basic science and clinical science,
[03:03:28.940 --> 03:03:32.000]   and also so many actionable recommendations,
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.040]   both do's and don'ts as it relates to something
[03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:36.980]   so critical as eye health.
[03:03:36.980 --> 03:03:40.000]   I also was just reflecting for a moment
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.480]   about the fact that I think you and I met 20 years ago
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:43.600]   when you were a graduate student.
[03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:47.840]   By the way, folks, Jeff is sort of a Kobe Bryant of sorts,
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:50.040]   although fortunately still with us
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:53.800]   in the sense that he went directly from his MD and PhD,
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:55.660]   skipped his postdoc, didn't require one,
[03:03:55.660 --> 03:03:58.120]   directly to being a faculty member.
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:03:59.040]   Most people don't do that.
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:00.780]   They do a five-year postdoc in between.
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:03.160]   Wait, and then I believe he's gonna tell me
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:05.000]   all the places I'm wrong, and I should just come clean
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:08.160]   that Jeff is my chair of department
[03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:11.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology.
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:15.180]   So for me, I see this as a particularly warming,
[03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:18.440]   but also at once unpredictable,
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:20.720]   but pure pleasure of an experience
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:22.040]   to get to learn so much from you.
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:23.640]   'Cause I don't think we've had this long to sit down
[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:25.920]   and talk science in a very long time.
[03:04:25.920 --> 03:04:30.160]   So thank you for doing that for my own sake.
[03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:31.540]   - Thank you for teaching us so much
[03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:33.080]   about how to take care of our eye health.
[03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:35.460]   And now you can tell me where my history is wrong
[03:04:35.460 --> 03:04:37.680]   and maybe my hippocampus is degenerating.
[03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:39.440]   - No, it's been a pleasure over the years.
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:43.080]   I have nothing but the warmest memories of you as a postdoc
[03:04:43.080 --> 03:04:45.880]   and me as a graduate student getting to be nerds
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:50.740]   in the laboratory 20 years ago, 20 years ago at Stanford,
[03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:52.260]   in the lab of Ben Baras,
[03:04:52.260 --> 03:04:57.000]   and very warm, wonderful feelings about learning science
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.540]   and how to do science and making real advances
[03:04:59.540 --> 03:05:00.840]   even at that time.
[03:05:00.840 --> 03:05:03.800]   And then the fact that we've had the chance to cross paths
[03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:06.160]   in San Diego, again, at Stanford,
[03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:08.240]   collaborate on important projects,
[03:05:08.240 --> 03:05:11.580]   having to do with developing new ways of measuring diseases,
[03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:13.940]   developing new ways of treating diseases.
[03:05:13.940 --> 03:05:16.380]   The idea that we're going to actually bring forward
[03:05:16.380 --> 03:05:20.200]   some of the advances that our lab, that your lab,
[03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:24.180]   that other people's labs have been making in neuroprotection
[03:05:24.180 --> 03:05:26.780]   in diseases like glaucoma and macular degeneration,
[03:05:26.780 --> 03:05:31.040]   in regeneration of the optic nerve, of the retina.
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:32.860]   We're real close on a lot of those.
[03:05:32.860 --> 03:05:36.280]   This is a major topic of really the cutting edge research
[03:05:36.280 --> 03:05:38.560]   that we're really trying to keep pushing forward
[03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:41.300]   because we know it's so important to patients.
[03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:46.300]   I often joke, my mother had a sign outside the bathroom
[03:05:46.300 --> 03:05:50.580]   and it said, "Remember, how long a minute is
[03:05:50.580 --> 03:05:53.680]   depends on what side of the door you're on."
[03:05:53.680 --> 03:05:56.680]   And I really appreciate that as fast as we're trying to go
[03:05:56.680 --> 03:05:59.480]   with our research and moving that into clinical research,
[03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:01.320]   which I think we're doing very effectively
[03:06:01.320 --> 03:06:04.520]   in the department, really working on vision restoration
[03:06:04.520 --> 03:06:06.200]   research in the department.
[03:06:06.200 --> 03:06:08.280]   I appreciate that as fast as we think we're going,
[03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:10.440]   it's not fast enough for so many patients
[03:06:10.440 --> 03:06:11.920]   who are suffering from these diseases.
[03:06:11.920 --> 03:06:13.920]   So thanks very much for having me on.
[03:06:13.920 --> 03:06:16.120]   It's been a real pleasure reconnecting
[03:06:16.120 --> 03:06:18.020]   over these many important topics.
[03:06:18.020 --> 03:06:20.280]   I really appreciate the chance to talk with you.
[03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:21.560]   - Well, delighted to do it
[03:06:21.560 --> 03:06:23.760]   and looking forward to doing it again.
[03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:26.580]   You're an amazing colleague, friend, clinician,
[03:06:26.580 --> 03:06:28.880]   and now public health educator.
[03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:30.180]   Thank you.
[03:06:30.180 --> 03:06:32.040]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:35.520]   all about eye and vision health with Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg.
[03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:38.500]   I hope you enjoyed the discussion as much as I did.

[03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:13.200]   During today's discussion and on many previous episodes
[03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:15.800]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[03:07:15.800 --> 03:07:17.900]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:07:17.900 --> 03:07:20.160]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:22.900]   for things like improving sleep, for hormone support,
[03:07:22.900 --> 03:07:24.300]   and for improving focus.
[03:07:24.300 --> 03:07:27.200]   Huberman Lab Podcast is partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:28.780]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[03:07:28.780 --> 03:07:30.200]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:07:30.200 --> 03:07:32.520]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[03:07:32.520 --> 03:07:35.540]   so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[03:07:35.540 --> 03:07:37.820]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:07:37.820 --> 03:07:39.960]   it is Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,
[03:07:39.960 --> 03:07:41.400]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:43.200]   In all those places, I discuss science
[03:07:43.200 --> 03:07:45.780]   and science-related tools, some of which overlap
[03:07:45.780 --> 03:07:47.700]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:49.860]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:07:49.860 --> 03:07:51.020]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:07:51.020 --> 03:07:54.480]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:07:54.480 --> 03:07:55.720]   If you haven't already signed up

[03:07:58.500 --> 03:08:01.640]   it is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[03:08:01.640 --> 03:08:03.540]   that includes podcast summaries,
[03:08:03.540 --> 03:08:07.280]   as well as protocols comprised of short PDFs
[03:08:07.280 --> 03:08:10.020]   that include everything from a toolkit for sleep,
[03:08:10.020 --> 03:08:12.060]   a toolkit for neuroplasticity or learning,
[03:08:12.060 --> 03:08:13.840]   toolkits for enhancing exercise,
[03:08:13.840 --> 03:08:16.760]   toolkits for enhancing various aspects of mental health,
[03:08:16.760 --> 03:08:17.820]   physical health, and performance.
[03:08:17.820 --> 03:08:20.100]   Again, all zero-cost and all available to you

[03:08:27.980 --> 03:08:29.880]   And again, it's the Neural Network Newsletter,
[03:08:29.880 --> 03:08:31.800]   and it is completely zero-cost.
[03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:33.100]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:08:33.100 --> 03:08:35.420]   for today's discussion with Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg.
[03:08:35.420 --> 03:08:37.780]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:08:37.780 --> 03:08:39.500]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:08:39.500 --> 03:08:42.080]   [upbeat music]
[03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:44.660]   (upbeat music)
