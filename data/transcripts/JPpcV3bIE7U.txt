[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   I should like to take you once more to the chapter that we've been considering
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.840]   the two previous evenings, namely the third chapter in Paul's first epistle to
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.160]   the Corinthians. And I'm going to read this evening the last three verses.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:31.760]   "Therefore let no man glory in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.160]   Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:49.760]   come, all are yours and ye are Christ's and Christ is God's." Now the word
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.600]   therefore at the beginning of the 21st verse tells us at once that the Apostle
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.380]   in these three verses is summing up or drawing a conclusion from what he has
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.400]   just been saying. And I suggest to you that the conclusion which we have in
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.760]   these three verses is not only the conclusion of what he has been saying
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.080]   immediately before in this context, but is indeed a summary and a summing up of
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.480]   the argument that he has been conducting from the early part of the first chapter.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.440]   Now the Apostle, as I've explained, wrote this letter to the Corinthians because
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.200]   of certain conditions that had arisen in the Christian Church. The Church had come
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.240]   into being as the result of his preaching and naturally therefore he was
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.040]   interested in her condition and the condition of the members. But
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.360]   unfortunately there had been troubles. Certain divisions had appeared in the
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.200]   Church. Some say that they were followers of Paul, others were followers of Apollos,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.040]   a fellow laborer with Paul. Then others said they were followers of Cephas, the
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.000]   Apostle Peter. And others, disdaining any following of men, said they were the
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.920]   followers of Christ. Now here was a very grievous problem. The Church dividing
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.360]   itself up into factions and following men and dividing from one another. In
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.880]   addition to that, certain false teachings that made their appearance. An element of
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.540]   philosophy and of human wisdom would come in, even with regard to the preaching
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.840]   of the cross itself. Now the Apostle is very disturbed about all this and that
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   is why he writes his letter. And what he really has to say to these people is
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.800]   that he's amazed at them. He's astonished at them. And he's astonished at them for
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.560]   this reason. That having become Christian, they were clearly tending to revert
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.840]   again to non-Christian teaching. Now that's what he says at the beginning of
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.080]   this third chapter. He says, "Brethren, I could not speak unto you as unto
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.920]   spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ." He says, "For you are yet
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.000]   carnal, for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions, are ye
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.480]   not carnal? And walk as men. For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.080]   Apollos, are ye not carnal?" Now this is the thing that astonishes him about these
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.840]   people. That having come to a knowledge of the gospel and its salvation, that
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.320]   they should be turning back again to that old way of thinking. And he's so
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.360]   disturbed about this, that he writes to them in very plain terms and in strong
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.000]   language. And as we've seen, he has told them that they must be perfectly clear
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.160]   about certain things. One is that there is only one foundation. But it is equally
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.560]   important that what is built on that foundation should correspond to the
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.760]   character of the foundation. It's not enough just to be right at the beginning.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.320]   It's not just enough to be right in your entry into the Christian life. You've got
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.880]   to continue with it. The Christian life is one. There must be a correspondence
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.440]   with what is built upon the foundation and the foundation itself. So the Apostle
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.240]   takes up these matters and he's been arguing them out, as we've been seeing
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.280]   during the two previous evenings. And in doing this, he has shown that this carnal
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.120]   thinking, this worldly thinking, shows itself in three main respects. The first
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.400]   is the failure to realize the magnitude of the problem. That is why he had to
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.840]   tell them that there was only one foundation. They were inadequate, as I
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.880]   tried to show the first evening, in their idea of sin and the condition of men and
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.720]   men especially standing before God in the judgment. They were totally inadequate
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.280]   in their understanding of that. And then secondly, as we saw last night, they were
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.360]   tending to bring in this element of human reason, human understanding. There
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.720]   was a certain amount of pride of intellect and a pride in the matter of
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.320]   reason. And we have dealt with that. And now I come to deal with the third
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.440]   element in this unhappy condition that had arisen in the church at Corinth. And
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:57.160]   that was this false confidence in men. Now here is the thing that we've got to
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.840]   look at together this evening. And in doing that, I'm not merely going to call
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.200]   your attention to a situation in the church at Corinth some 1,900 years ago.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   Let no one think that what I'm going to do is something academic or theoretical
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.040]   and remote from life. I'm interested in this, not in some kind of antiquarian
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.160]   manner. My dear friends, the world is in too desperate a plight for that. Men and
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.560]   women are in need, as I'm going to show you. I'm calling attention to it for this
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.960]   reason only. That I want to show you that what troubled and afflicted this church
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.560]   1,900 years ago is still true. And as we follow the way in which Paul deals with
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.200]   these matters, we shall discover that he's dealing with the problems of modern
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.040]   men. For of all the fallacies of which the modern man is guilty, there is none
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.680]   which is greater than this, that he imagines that his position is a new one.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.240]   There is nothing new under the sun. And the things which cause people to stumble
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.920]   at the gospel today were precisely the things which caused them to stumble at
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.360]   it in the first century. Now then, let's see how the Apostle deals with it. The
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.480]   first thing that I want to emphasize is this, that the Apostle says that these
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.360]   people in Corinth are acting as fools. Now, we were dealing with that in a measure
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   last night. He says, "Let no man deceive himself." But that is what men does when
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.600]   he in any way departs from the gospel. The man who rejects this gospel is a
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.900]   fool. "Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.840]   world, let him become a fool that he may be made wise. For the wisdom of this
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:56.560]   world is foolishness with God." And so on. Now here is a very important proposition.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.280]   The Bible has got many things to say about a man who doesn't believe in God,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:09.160]   about a man who isn't a Christian. It says that he is lawless, that he is
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.920]   disobedient, that he's a man who's missed the mark. It has got many things
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.720]   to say about him. But I think you'll agree with me, those of you who know your
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.280]   Bibles, that what the Bible seems to say most frequently about the man who lives
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:32.160]   his life without God and without this gospel is that he is a fool, by which it
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.560]   means that he doesn't think. He doesn't think straightly. There is something
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.000]   warped about his whole process of reasoning. And this is the charge, of
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.020]   course, which the Apostle is elaborating at this particular point. And he says to
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.640]   these Corinthians who are tending to go back to that old style of thinking, "You're
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.360]   deceiving yourselves. You're going back to the position in which you once were.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.640]   Now you mustn't do this," says the Apostle. And this, of course, is the message of the
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:12.080]   gospel to everybody in the world tonight, that sin is ultimately self-deception.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:21.360]   And the man who rejects this gospel is a man who is a fool, and especially in this
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:30.120]   respect, that he fools and misleads and deceives himself. How does he do so?
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.400]   Well, one of the commonest ways of all at the present time is this. The vast
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.160]   majority of people who are not Christian in the world congratulate themselves on
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:49.880]   that fact. They say, "Look at the world in the past. People were religious. They were
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.680]   brought up in a religious manner. They were compelled to go to church. And here
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.600]   they were under the tyranny of this religion and its system." But they think
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.400]   and claim that they've broken free from all this. Possibly many of us who are here
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.680]   tonight passed through this stage in our adolescent years. We've been made to go
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.320]   to church and to Sunday school and so on, but now we say we've become men. We've
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.280]   grown up. We're able to think for ourselves. What's the first thing we're
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.440]   going to do? Well, we're going to shake off this religion. We want to be free. We
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.680]   want to emancipate ourselves. And this is the common attitude in the world this
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.000]   evening. You're familiar with how this is put in the communistic teaching, for
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.440]   instance, that religion has been the dope or the opiate of the people, that it's
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.440]   been some sort of shackles on the forward march of the human race, that
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.880]   it's kept people down. And the first thing you've got to do, therefore, is to
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.400]   get rid of this incubus of religion. And then you'll be a free man, and you'll live
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.280]   in a free world, and you'll really begin to live life as you should. Now, I think
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:08.200]   you'll all agree that this is one of the commonest of all the attitudes towards
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.680]   religion. And this is precisely the thing with which the Apostle deals here. And
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.960]   what he says is this, and he proves his case. Men and women, in rejecting this
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:31.000]   gospel, far from achieving freedom, are but continuing in a state of bondage. To
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.680]   reject this gospel is not to be free. It is to become a slave. It is to become a
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:42.880]   bond-servant. And so, this is the fundamental proposition of the gospel.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.280]   This is what it says to the whole world tonight. Here is a world claiming that
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.640]   it's shaken off religion, and has achieved this kind of emancipation.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:58.200]   Unfortunately, it requires no special ability to show and to demonstrate that
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.840]   what the world is really doing to itself is to perpetuate its own slavery, and to
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:11.800]   refuse the only one who can ever set a man or a nation or a world free, Jesus of
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:18.960]   Nazareth, the Son of God. Now, how does the Apostle prove this? Well, the first thing
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:25.040]   he does, I'll put in the form of a proposition like this. He demonstrates
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:33.680]   the utter folly of glorying in men. Now, that is what these people were doing.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.080]   Here they were, you see, one was always talking about Paul, another was always
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.040]   talking about Apollos, another always praising Peter. Now, this word "glorying" is a
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.520]   very important one. It doesn't mean that you're just interested. It doesn't mean
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.600]   that you tend to agree with the men. To glory in a man is to mean that you make
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   your boast in him. That's the correct translation of the word in the Greek
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.400]   that was used by the Apostle. You make your boast in him. You give him an
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.920]   allegiance. You fall at his feet, as it were. You become bound to him. He's your
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:16.680]   master. He's your teacher. Now, this is the great characteristic of the life of the
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:22.800]   world in which we are living at this present time. The world has turned its
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:30.760]   back upon religion, and it is putting its faith in men, in human leaders, and in
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:39.080]   human teaching. Now, this is something, of course, which is not new. It takes different
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:45.200]   forms at different times and in different places. But this is what the
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.680]   world has always been doing, as the Apostle Paul shows, whenever it turns its
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:59.160]   back upon God and upon our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching of the Bible. Now,
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:05.720]   it changes its allegiance. I remember a time before the First World War when men
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:13.320]   tended to glory in politicians and in statesmen. I remember the time quite well.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:19.800]   They felt that by acts of Parliament you were going to legislate in a new world,
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:26.200]   a new era. You were going to legislate in the kingdom of God. Men who formerly had
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.280]   given their allegiance and had followed the great preachers of the gospel, they
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:36.160]   ceased to do so. And they began to give this allegiance to these statesmen, to
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.560]   these politicians. They really worshipped them. They felt these men were going to
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.740]   solve the problems of the human race. But by now, of course, that is no longer the
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:51.840]   position. And the modern man tends to pin his faith in the thinkers, and especially
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:00.240]   in the scientists. And man is looked up to. Of course, in doing this, man is really
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.720]   only looking up to himself. For after all, the great man is just every one of us
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:11.280]   writ large. So man, in giving his allegiance to and glorying in his great
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.360]   men, is really worshipping himself. Now, you will agree without any further
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.240]   demonstration that one of the greatest characteristics of this present age is
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:28.360]   the cult of personality. Certain figures stand out. People look at them, they'll
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.440]   stand for hours just to get a glimpse of them, and they hold on to every word that
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.760]   they utter. Now, this is the state of affairs, the very thing the apostle is
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.920]   dealing with. You see, it can even come into the Christian church itself. Men are
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:49.640]   exaggerated. Men are blown up to great dimensions, and people glory in men. Now,
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:55.760]   the whole world is doing this very thing. And the apostle here turns to people who
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:02.160]   do that, and he says, "Therefore let no man glory in men." "Do you realize what you're
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.800]   doing?" he says. "You're giving this adulation to men. You who claim to have known
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.720]   Christ, you are giving this total allegiance either to me or Apollos or
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.360]   Cephas or anybody else. Don't you realize how monstrous it is?" says the apostle.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.460]   "You're denying the whole of the gospel. This is carnal thinking. This is something
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.880]   that you must get rid of, otherwise your whole foundation and basis in the
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:34.600]   Christian faith is in jeopardy." But why should we not glory in men? Here is a
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   question I'm sure that's in the minds of many. Let's consider this. Why is it
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   unutterable folly to glory in men? Well, the apostle gives us an abundant answer
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:53.080]   here. The first thing is this, that man, after all, is only a creature. He's a
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:59.120]   created being. He's like all other men. And he has nothing whereof to boast. The
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.320]   apostle says this about himself. He says, "Why, why are you boasting in us?" He says,
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:12.040]   "Who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom ye believed? Even as
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.240]   the Lord gave to every man, I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.040]   the increase." My preaching, says Paul, would have achieved nothing if it were
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.720]   left to itself. The preaching of Apollos would have done nothing. It is God that
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.040]   giveth the increase. So then, neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:37.680]   watereth, but God that giveth the increase. And in the next chapter, he takes up
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.880]   this same point. And he says, "What maketh thee to differ from another? What hast
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.640]   thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.200]   glory as if thou hast not received it?" "You know," says Paul, "you mustn't glory in me.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:01.280]   I'm only a minister. I'm only a steward of the mysteries of Christ and of God." And
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.680]   in the second epistle to the Iscariotians, he puts it still more
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:11.520]   plainly. He says, "We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:18.960]   your servants for Jesus' sake." He says, "You mustn't glory in me. I'm only a servant,
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:25.040]   and I've got nothing except that which I have received." Now here is surely a great
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.280]   principle that we should put before the modern world. The world that glories in
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.680]   and boasts of men and attributes so much to men, they deride and dismiss the
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.360]   gospel. Jesus Christ is nobody but great men. Now the question we need to put to
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.200]   them is this. Are they not guilty of unutterable folly in doing this? Take the
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.560]   great men that the world reveres. Have they created their powers? Take a man
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.920]   like Shakespeare. Did he generate his own gifts? Did he produce these astounding
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.760]   abilities? No, no. He was born with them. He's got nothing to boast of, and we
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.720]   shouldn't boast of him. He's received, or any great genius, a military genius, a
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.600]   genius in science, whatever you like. These men have not produced their gifts.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.560]   They are born with them. They've received them, and so the Apostles' question is the
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.720]   most urgent question, surely, for the modern men. "Whom maketh he to differ from
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.480]   another, and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.560]   receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?" So then it is
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:44.000]   very foolish to be glorying in a man. He doesn't deserve the glory. He is what he
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.040]   is in spite, as it were, of himself. But then there's a second reason why it is so
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.800]   foolish to glory in men, and that is, as I've shown on a previous evening, that
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   the powers of men, at their very best and highest, are very seriously limited. I'm
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.520]   not here to say anything against great men, but I am here to say that it's
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.920]   madness to worship them, or to pin your faith in them. However great they are, they
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.320]   haven't solved the problem of life. They haven't solved the problem of death. They
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:20.960]   haven't solved what are your most pressing problems and mine, even at their
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:28.480]   very best and highest. And not only that, all the powers that any man has are
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:35.560]   bound to wane, and they do wane. As he gets older, his powers begin to fail him. And
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.600]   this has always been the case, and always will be. And in any case, anything that a
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:47.400]   great man has ever discovered is at its best and its highest only partial. Now
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   this is something that needs no demonstration. Haven't you noticed how
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:57.000]   textbooks so soon get out of date? I think of textbooks on medicine, which
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.280]   students had to read 40 years ago. Probably some of them are not even known
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.200]   at the present time. They're out of date. Knowledge advances and grows, and what
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.920]   the great men of the past appear to have discovered is ridiculed at the present
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.440]   time. Newton and his discoveries were regarded as absolutes until
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.480]   comparatively recently. The last word, but Newtonian physics is already
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.960]   seriously, hopelessly out of date. I remember being taught that the atom was
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:33.400]   the smallest and indivisible portion of matter. The atom could not be divided.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.760]   There was nothing smaller than the atom. By today, we know again that this is
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:44.040]   utterly ridiculous and hopelessly out of date. So you see, whatever men can do for
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:51.920]   us, it's limited, it's partial, and it dates and ceases to be of value. But
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:59.520]   finally, it is unutterable folly to glory in men because these men themselves are
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.680]   failures. Man is sinful. Every man is sinful. The men who are lauded by the
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:12.760]   world, the men in whom the world glories, what feet of clay they have. All these
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:19.640]   idols that men produce and men that are turned into idols by men, how
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.440]   obvious it is that they have feet of clay. How capricious they are. We've had a
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.200]   notable example of this quite recently to which I need make no reference. But you
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.560]   see, these idols, these men who seem to stride the world like a colossus, how
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.840]   fallible they are, how unreliable, how uncertain, how selfish they are, how
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.760]   obstinate some of them are. And yet the world puts its faith in these and
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.960]   regards it as an insult to be asked to believe in and to glory in the Lord
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:55.600]   Jesus Christ. This is the folly of men. And that's the point that the Apostle is
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.800]   here arguing with these Corinthians. Therefore, let no man glory in men.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:08.120]   Doesn't matter who he is. He is unworthy of being gloried in. He's too small, he's
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:14.280]   too fallible, he is too sinful. But the more serious thing which the Apostle
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:22.560]   tells us is this, that we must not glory in men, because if we do so, we shall
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:29.160]   inevitably end in slavery. You notice how he puts it. He says, therefore let no men
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:36.520]   glory in men. Why not? He says, for all things are yours. All things are yours.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:41.240]   Why are you glorying in men? You have no need to, because all things are yours,
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:48.520]   whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:56.200]   present or things to come. All are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is God's.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:03.360]   Now that's his way of saying that to put your glory in men inevitably and always
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.280]   leads to slavery. He says you think you're going to gain something by doing
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.640]   this, you're going to lose something. He says on the contrary, because all things
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.800]   in Christ are yours and by turning from him to anybody else you are but
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:25.520]   reverting to slavery. Now here I think is the essence of the modern problem and
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.040]   the modern difficulty with the world in which we are living. It is in a condition
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:36.080]   of slavery. It's turned its back upon God and religion and it's put its faith
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:43.960]   in men. What is the result? The result is it is in a condition of slavery to men.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:49.480]   The great William Penn who founded Pennsylvania, he said all this, you know,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:57.560]   nearly 300 years ago. He said men must choose to be governed by God or they
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:05.120]   condemn themselves to be ruled by tyrants. And what a profound remark that
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:12.800]   is. And how painfully does this 20th century of ours prove the wisdom of that
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:20.280]   dictum of the great William Penn. Isn't this the tragedy of the 20th century? Let
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.600]   me give you an illustration or two. Look at the position in Russia. Here is a
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.040]   country that has turned its back upon religion, denounced it, dismissed it,
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:38.840]   condemned it. Atheism is the rule because, as they say, it is this religion that has
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.380]   kept the people down. So they say the first thing we've got to do is to
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:49.000]   banish religion and then you'll get your freedom. That's what they've said. But
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.720]   what is the result? Look at the position in that country. It is unutterable
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:01.040]   slavery. Not only political slavery. You've got slavery even in the matter of
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:07.840]   art, slavery in the matter of literature, slavery even in the matter of science.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:13.080]   The state dictates even to the scientific research worker with respect
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.160]   to his results. There was the famous case of Lysenko and you've had similar cases
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.400]   among some of their literary men. Now you see the Apostle says let no men deceive
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.200]   himself. Yet that is precisely what the man who abolishes religion always does.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.600]   He thinks he's clever, he thinks he can set himself free, he can emancipate
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.480]   himself, get rid of God, he says you're going to be free. He gets rid of God as
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:42.640]   it were and you see where he lends himself. In unutterable slavery to men, to
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.320]   the state, to governments, to laws and enactments in every realm and department
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.280]   of life. What else? Well you know the great higher critical movement of the
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:01.240]   scriptures. It began in Germany about 130 years ago. Germany was in the vein in
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   this supposed liberation of men from the throldom of the dictatorship of the
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:12.080]   Bible. They were going to set men free. That's where the movement began and it
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   began not only in the realm of theology, their philosophers followed along the
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:22.080]   same line. What has it led to? Has this banishment of the authority of the
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:27.000]   scripture led to freedom and liberty in Germany? The answer can be given in one
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.660]   word, Hitler. Never has there been a more awful dictatorship. But this is you see
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:38.320]   the thing the world doesn't understand. It thinks it's clever, it's up-to-date,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.560]   it's come of age, you get rid of religion and man is free. Invariably as the
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.240]   Apostle says, this is self-deception. You're putting yourself under the tyranny
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.080]   of men. It is the fulfillment of the dictum of William Pym. Men must choose to
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:59.080]   be governed by God or they condemn themselves to be ruled by tyrants.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.400]   Mussolini. And think of the various tyrants that are ruling in this world
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.960]   tonight. Governing the very minds of men and their bodies, the entire system. Oh
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:18.720]   the Apostle you see says this 1900 years ago. But oh how blind man is, what
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:24.760]   self-deception sin is, what a fool the sinner is, imagining that freedom means
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:31.520]   renouncing God. And it ever leads to nothing but slavery. Indeed there is
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.600]   nothing more pathetic to me than to notice the way in which these great men,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:44.080]   as they're called, are pitiful slaves themselves. Slaves to their own position,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.600]   slaves to public opinion and applause. These great dictators, notice how
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.780]   sensitive they are, how troubled they are, if somebody else's popularity seems to be
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:29:00.000]   going up. No, no my friends, Shakespeare said it long ago, uneasy lies the head
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.800]   that wears a crown. A man may get to the top, is he happy, is he free? No, no he's
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.840]   the slave of his own position. He sees another man coming up and threatening
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.600]   his position. This is slavery. Even men of wealth and possessions and various other
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.920]   things, they become slaves to the very thing they've created themselves. And
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.920]   their lives are a misery and unhappiness. But not only that says the Apostle, there
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:33.720]   is another most terrible consequence. If you turn your back upon God, you will not
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:43.520]   only become the slave of men, you will become the slave of the world, the
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:49.240]   slave of life, the slave of death, the slave of things present, the slave of
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.600]   things to come. You see this is the Apostle's way of putting it. He says don't
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.840]   glory in men, because all things are yours. I'm yours, Apollos is yours,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:05.960]   Cephas is yours, the world is yours, life is yours, death is yours, things present,
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:10.360]   things to come. But he says in turning away from the Lord Jesus Christ and
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.720]   glorying in men, you become the slaves of all these things and don't realize that
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:22.200]   they are yours. Is he right? Well let's ask a serious question. Are you my friend
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.420]   free tonight? And if you are, what about your neighbor? Put this question to him
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.840]   when you go home tonight or tomorrow. He says he's free, he's not interested in
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.920]   Christianity. He's sorry for you when he sees you going to a place of worship on
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.260]   Sunday morning. Poor miserable slave, he says, fancies still doing this. He's
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.200]   afraid not to do it. If only you were free like I am. Just put a few questions
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:52.480]   to him and show him how he has become a slave to the world. There is nothing to
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:58.840]   me that is sadder about the modern man than his utter slavery and serfdom to
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:05.480]   the world, the mind and the outlook of the world. What do I mean? Well the
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:11.600]   Apostle Paul again expounds himself in a word that he uses to the Ephesians. He
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.520]   says, "You were the equipped to wear dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:23.160]   past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the Prince of
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.560]   the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.720]   Now this is the most interesting phrase. How did you live, says Paul to the
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:38.200]   Ephesians, before you became Christians? The answer is, you lived entirely
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:44.800]   according to the course of this world. That means according to the tyranny and
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:51.720]   the bondage of the way and the mind and the outlook of the world. Isn't this
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.860]   obvious today? Take these people who dismiss religion and scoff at it and say
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:02.680]   that they're free men. Are they free men? What is their life determined by? What
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.900]   decides how they live? Do they? Of course they don't. They do what they see on the
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:13.400]   television. They do what they hear on the radio. They do what they read in the
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.080]   morning newspaper. I remember reading a statement by a great educationalist in
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.800]   Oxford during the war, Sir Richard Livingstone. He was one of our greatest,
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.560]   if not the greatest, authority and education in Great Britain, and he wrote
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:34.440]   a book in 1944. And in that book he said this. He said, "What has been the chief
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:40.440]   result in this country of the popular education that we've enjoyed since the
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:47.160]   Education Act of 1870?" A great act was passed in 1870 giving popular education
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.520]   freely. He said, "What has been the chief result of this up to date?" And this is
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.960]   his answer. He said, "It seems to me that the chief result of popular education
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:06.400]   since 1870 up to date has been this. It has been to produce a mentality that is
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:12.800]   governed solely by the thinking and the ideas of Beaverbrook and Metro Goldwyn."
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:19.440]   And how perfectly true that is. The modern man who thinks he's free because
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.020]   he's shaken off religion, what's he governed by? He's governed by his morning
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:29.760]   newspaper, the popular press, Metro Goldwyn, the cinema, the film, the acting,
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:35.600]   advertising. It's the age of advertising, the age of propaganda. Never have men and
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.040]   women been greater slaves than they are at the present time. They're slaves to the
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.680]   world. The modern man who thinks he's free because he's shaken off religion,
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.120]   what's he governed by? He's governed by his morning newspaper, the popular press,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:55.840]   Metro Goldwyn, the cinema, the film, the acting, advertising. It's the age of
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:01.040]   advertising, the age of propaganda. Never have men and women been greater slaves
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.320]   than they are at the present time. They're slaves to the world. They're governed by
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.160]   what other people do, what other people think, what other people say. They're
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.000]   governed in their dress, in their speech, in their walk, in their conduct, in
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.760]   everything, by the way of the world. Slavery to the world. But it isn't only
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.720]   slavery to the world, says the Apostle. They're slaves of money, they're slaves of
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:31.440]   possessions, they're slaves, as I say, of their own positions. But in addition to
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:37.720]   being slaves to the world, they are slaves to life itself. They're afraid of life.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:45.160]   Never has man been more afraid of life than he is today. He's the victim of it,
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:50.040]   he doesn't understand it, he's being carried along by it. Now, you've got your
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.080]   problems here as we've got them in Britain, problems of these poor young
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.440]   people who seem to be defying all rule and law and order and custom, who just
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.320]   want to be different and not to conform to anything at all in any respect. What's
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:11.400]   the matter with them? The answer is they're afraid of life. They are slaves to the fear of
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:17.160]   life and living. They can't stand up to it. To be ordinary, decent citizens is too
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.520]   great a demand. They're in a condition of slavery. Then he says the same is true
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:30.400]   about death. And isn't this true likewise? Oh, the power of the fear of death. I know
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.120]   the modern man pretends that he's not afraid of death. He whistles to keep up
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:39.040]   his courage in the dark. But never has an age or a generation have been more
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.720]   subject to the fear of death, slavery to the fear of death, than this present
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.640]   generation. The author of the epistle to the Hebrews in his second chapter and in
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.880]   verse 14 says that one of the most glorious things that the Lord Jesus
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.640]   Christ has done has been to deliver them who through all their lifetime were
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:03.520]   subject to bondage, the fear of death. And the modern man does everything he can to
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.440]   dismiss the notion of death. We try to keep young, to look young, to dress young.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.840]   We're horrified of this, this awful specter that is ever approaching to us,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:17.760]   the fear of death, this bond that's hanging over us. Isn't this true? We think
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.640]   we've made ourselves free by turning our backs upon God and upon his Son, but we
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.760]   are slaves to the fear of death. And it's exactly the same as he says with regard
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:36.240]   to the present and with regard to the future. Yes, I can show you very simply.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.640]   One of the great prophets of this freedom of men, once he gets rid of the
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:48.320]   incubus of religion, was the late Mr. H.G. Wells. He taught that men simply needed
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.280]   education and knowledge, and they'd banish war and they'd turn their world
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.920]   into a paradise. And he believed this, and he propagated it. But then the Second
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.520]   World War came, and poor H.G. Wells, you know the title of the last book he ever
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:10.360]   wrote? "Mind at the End of its Tether." He was afraid of the future. He was afraid
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:15.680]   of the outcome. All he'd ever preached had come crashing to the ground. Let me quote
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.320]   another man to you. There was a man who was president of the college in Cambridge,
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:28.480]   and he wrote an autobiography. His name was Professor R.R. Marrett, and in
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.840]   that book, again during the last war, he wrote one of the saddest sentences I
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:40.800]   think I've ever read in my life. Here it is. I've remembered it ever since. "But to me,"
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:49.400]   he said, the war—he meant the Second War—"to me, the war brought to an end the long
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:57.040]   autumn of my life. Henceforth, the long summer of my life," I should have said, "to
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:02.680]   me the war brought to an end the long summer of my life, the culture and the
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.840]   learning and the happiness of life in Oxford. Henceforth, I have nothing to look
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:18.040]   forward to except chill autumn and still chillier winter. And yet I'm a summer," he
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.480]   says, "try not to lose hope." Have you ever heard of anything more hopeless? Here is a
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.760]   man who's afraid of the present. He's afraid of the future. He's in a condition
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:32.440]   of utter slavery. He doesn't understand. He hasn't got any control. He sees it
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.660]   coming. It's inevitable. Nothing can be done to stop it. And here he is, admitting
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:45.320]   complete and utter bankruptcy. Ah, we've traveled a long way since one of the
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:52.160]   victorians, Sir Henry Newbault, was able to write his famous poem "Invictus." How
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:57.000]   optimistic and self-satisfied people were towards the end of the last
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.040]   century. You see, with the Pax Britannica and with the belief that men was
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:07.360]   evolving and that wars would be banished, men thought that at last they could
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:13.160]   really get rid of God and be in absolute control of themselves and their life and
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.960]   their living. So he writes like this, "It matters not how straight the gate, how
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:29.240]   inaccessible the girl. I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul." Do
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:34.360]   you hear that today? Of course you don't. They hadn't discovered the atomic bomb
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.640]   then. There hadn't been the two world wars then. And men could stand up and say, "I
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.920]   don't need God. I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul." Are you?
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.600]   Can you stand up in this modern world and say that? With all that is happening
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:54.640]   around and about you, locally, nationally, internationally. Are you in control? Are
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.360]   you the master of your fate? Are you the captain of your soul? Of course you're
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.960]   not. You're trembling, you're alarmed, you're frightened. You're a slave to all
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   these things that are around and about you. Well now, my friends, that is what
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:19.280]   glorying in men always and invariably leads to. This modern world of ours is
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.040]   proving the gospel in a way that it has never been preached, never been proved. I
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:28.600]   sometimes say in my pulpit in London that I'm very glad that I'm preaching in
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.480]   this century and not in the last century. People are astonished to hear that. But
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.960]   why do I say it? I say it for this reason. It must have been rather difficult to
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:43.040]   preach this gospel in the Victorian era, say a hundred years ago. Why? Well, as I
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:49.040]   say, life seemed to be so wonderful. We belonged to an empire on which the sun
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:53.640]   never sets. Knowledge was growing and developing. Life was comfortable and
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.280]   wonderful. Everything was going forward. It must have been rather difficult to
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.380]   preach to people and to tell them that they were simmers and that they were in
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.640]   a condition of bondage. Everything seemed so marvelous. It's not at all difficult
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:11.040]   today. The modern world is proving the truth of the Apostles' contention. Turn
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.520]   your back on God and you'll be a slave. Slave to men, slave to the world, slave
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.640]   to life, slave to death, slave to the present, slave to the future. And this is
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:27.440]   the tragedy, that men in doing this thinks he's setting himself free, deceiving
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:36.440]   himself. Why? Well, because he turns away from the only one who ever really can
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:42.480]   set him free and give him possession of the things that are now mastering and
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:48.280]   enslaving him. Who is this? It is this Christ of whom he's writing. He's the
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:54.120]   only foundation. He's the only everything. Listen, says Paul, don't glory in men
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:58.840]   whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:05.080]   present or things to come, because all are yours and you are Christ's and Christ
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:14.600]   is God's. In whom should we glory? The answer is, we should glory in this Jesus
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:20.280]   of Nazareth. Why? The Lord, he talks about. He says it at the end of the first
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:28.560]   chapter, "Him that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." Why should any man glory in
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.640]   the Lord Jesus Christ? Let me tell you, it's the exact opposite of all that we've
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:44.160]   been considering. We should glory in him because he is who he is. Who is he? He's
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:52.000]   not merely a man. Here is the everlasting eternal Son of God. In the beginning was
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.360]   the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. Here he is. This is the
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.680]   one by whom and through whom all things have been made and without whom nothing
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:11.520]   was made that is made. Who is this? This is the one who is co-equal with God the
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:19.280]   Father and God the Holy Spirit and he is the one for whom this world was made. The
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.920]   Apostle says that in the epistle to the Colossians in the first chapter. Not only
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:29.180]   were all things made by him but all things were made for him. You know this
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:34.800]   old world of ours it was made not for us, it was made for the Lord Jesus Christ. It
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.680]   was the Father's gift to his Son. He made a universe for him. He made men for him.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:47.000]   Here it is he said it's yours. He's the one who owns the entire universe.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.040]   But not only that you see here he is in this world and he is the only one who
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:59.920]   can speak to us with authority about these ultimate questions that so agitated
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.800]   our minds and our hearts and our consciences. Do you remember how he put it
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.720]   to Nicodemus? There was a man called Nicodemus, a great teacher of the jewels,
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:15.740]   a great religious teacher and yet when he saw this Jesus and heard his teaching
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.980]   and saw his miracles he realized his superiority and he went and had an
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.440]   interview with him. He was trying to understand him but he couldn't but our
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:29.840]   Lord turns to him and he says this, "Art thou a master of Israel and understandest
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:37.800]   not these things? Verily, verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:44.040]   testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness. If I have told
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.920]   you earthly things and he believe not how shall he believe if I tell you
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:54.040]   heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:59.400]   heaven even the Son of Man which is in heaven. That's why you should glory in
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:04.440]   him my friend. Do you want someone to follow? Do you want someone whose
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.960]   teaching you can espouse? Do you want someone who will lead you and guide you
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:17.440]   and direct you? Here is the only one who is worthy of your allegiance. Because as
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:26.480]   he says we speak that we do know and testify that which we have seen. It's
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.240]   alright to read a great philosopher's book on religion and on life and on God.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:37.120]   What does he know? Has he ever seen God? What does he know about God? It is all
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:42.040]   speculation. It is all theory. That's what you get in your newspapers. That's what
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.480]   you get on your television. That's what you get on your radio. Speculations. Men
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.040]   standing up and saying I say this and people say isn't it wonderful how modern
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:55.120]   he is, how daring he is. But what is he speaking? What does he know? What's his
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:01.080]   authority? Nothing but his own self-confidence and self-delusion. This
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:07.200]   world has only seen one person who has the right to get up and say follow me.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:14.480]   He's the only one who's had the right to say I am the light of the world. I am the
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:20.120]   way the truth and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. Why should I
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:26.240]   listen to him? It is because he's come from him. He knows God. He's looked into
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.960]   the face of God. He speaks what he has seen, what he knows, and no one else's.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   That's why you should listen to him. It is because of who he is and what he is and
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:44.480]   the authority which he has as the only begotten Son of God. But let me give you
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:51.200]   a further reason. You should glory in him and give him your utter allegiance because
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   of what he has done for you. What has he done? Why did the Son of God ever come
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:03.800]   into this world? Why is there such a thing as Christianity? Who is this Christ?
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:09.000]   Why do I commend him to you? Why do I ask you to give yourself to him, not to any
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.960]   man, not to any preacher? It is because, I say, of who he is and then of what he has
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.560]   done. What has he done? Well, he came into this world to deal with our every
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:27.080]   problem. He came to set us free. The Son of Man, he says, has come to seek and to
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:32.560]   save that which is lost. If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.920]   Listen to him. If you continue in my word, he says, then you shall be my
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:42.400]   disciples indeed, and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.880]   The foolish Jews listening to him said, "How sayest thou he shall be made free?
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:54.280]   We are Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man." That's what they said
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:59.240]   to him. What liars they were. Fancy Jews saying to him in those days, "We have
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:03.440]   never been in bondage to any man." And they were in bondage at that very time to
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.400]   the Roman Empire, and they'd been conquered by previous empires. Yet you
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:12.080]   see, in national, political, militaristic pride, they say, "How sayest thou he shall
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:17.560]   be made free? We were never in bondage to any man. We are Abraham's seed." This is how
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:22.080]   men are still doing, bursting in men and knowledge and nationality and traditions
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.560]   and rejecting this gospel. But our Lord's answer is simple. "Whosoever
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:35.080]   committeth sin is the servant of sin, and that is why you need to be set free," he
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:40.880]   says. And he came in order to set us free. What do we need to be freed from? Well,
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.360]   the first thing we all need to be freed from is the guilt of our sin. We have all
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.600]   sinned against God. We are all guilty before God. The whole world lies guilty
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:57.360]   before him, and our guilt is upon us, and you can never get it free. And the labors
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:04.480]   of my hands, fulfill my Lord's demands, could my zeal no respite, no, could my
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:12.600]   tears forever flow. All for sin could not atone. Can you get rid of the guilt of
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.000]   your past, the guilt of your sins? It hangs heavily upon you. You're in its
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.080]   grip, I say. It's weighing upon you. You're the slave of your own past, and you can't
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:28.600]   get rid of it. Oh, literature has dealt with this. Shakespeare in his Macbeth, Lady
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:34.120]   Macbeth, seeing the stains on her hand, "Oh, for some niter, for some soap," she says, "to
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:39.480]   get rid of it." But it can't be done. What I have done, I have done, and I can't erase
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:45.120]   it. Do you know this Son of God came into the world to set you free from the guilt
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:51.320]   of your sin. He came and took your sins in his own body on the tree, and he will
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:57.440]   set you free from condemnation, being therefore justified by faith. We have
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:04.240]   peace with God. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:12.280]   Jesus, free from the guilt of my sin. But not only that, he has conquered my
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:18.760]   greatest enemy, the devil. Here is the one who has got everybody down from the
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.920]   beginning, your greatest patriots, your greatest saints, your apostles, everybody.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.400]   He has defeated them all. There is only one who has been able to bind the strong
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:35.240]   man armed, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God. He's conquered him. He's cast him out
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:41.040]   from heaven, and he will finally destroy him completely. He has already conquered
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:47.360]   the devil and can set you free from the throldom and the tyranny and the dominion
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:55.240]   of the devil. What else? The law of God, threatening condemnation. I am dead to
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   the law. The law can't touch me. The terrors of law and of God with me can
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:07.200]   have nothing to do. My Savior's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:12.720]   from view. He has set us free from the law, and he has set us free from the last
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:18.800]   enemy, which is death. That's why you should glory in him. Look what he's done.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:24.960]   He's conquered your every enemy. But more than that, I'll give you a wonderful
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:31.960]   reason for glorying in him. Look at his present position. Where is he? He is
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:38.420]   seated at the right hand of God in the glory of a lost thing. He said before he
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:45.880]   left this world, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." Did you know
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:54.000]   that this same Jesus is the Lord of history? All things are in his hands. Read
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.400]   again that great fifth chapter of the book of Revelation. There's a scene in
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:04.880]   heaven. A scroll is brought forward with seals all around it. What is it? It is
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:10.080]   the scroll of the book of history. And the question was, is there anybody who's
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:15.160]   big enough and strong enough to open the book and to unfold history and to tell
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:20.600]   us of the future and to govern history? And there was no one anywhere even in
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:25.360]   heaven who was big enough and great enough to break the seals and to open
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:32.000]   the book. And John who had the vision began to weep and to cry, but an angel
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   turned to him said, "Weep not. The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.880]   break the seals and to open the book." And he has. Did you know that the whole of
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:49.160]   history is in his hands? You know it isn't these dictators and politicians
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:54.600]   who are governing the world ultimately. It is all in the hands of Jesus Christ,
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:53:00.280]   the Lord of glory. He is waiting and sitting until his enemies shall be made
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:06.320]   his footstool. There's a reason for glorying in him. He doesn't get old.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:12.200]   Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Your popes, your priests, they
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.560]   come and go. He abides, he continues, because he is the eternal Son of God.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:22.800]   What a reason for glorying in him. Let me give you another. Consider what he's yet
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:30.040]   going to do. What is that? Well there is a day coming when he's going to come back
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.080]   again into this world. He said so repeatedly and his word is never broken.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:42.040]   This same Jesus who was crucified, died, buried, rose again, ascended into heaven,
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:47.240]   who is at the right hand of God, he will come again. He will ride the clouds of
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:52.840]   heaven surrounded by the holy angels. He will destroy his every enemy. He'll purge
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:58.640]   the cosmos of all sin and he'll set up his eternal glorious kingdom of
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:04.760]   righteousness and of peace. That's a reason for glorying in him. Your statesmen
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:09.860]   can't do that, your politicians can't do that, your poets can't do that, no man can
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:16.240]   do that, he alone can do this and he's going to do it. And my dear friend, if you
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.960]   but believe in him, do you know what happens to him? To you? You become a part
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.760]   of him. You are Christ's, says Paul. You know when you believe on the Lord Jesus
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:31.080]   Christ, it isn't merely an intellectual matter in the head, it is that, but
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.960]   there's something much more important. You are joined to him. You enter into a
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:42.240]   union with him. You are in Christ and you begin to share with him what you share
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:47.680]   with him. Well, I've already told you that God gave him the world. He made it for
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:53.480]   him and he gave it to him. He put men in it. Man has brought the chaos that we see
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.680]   in the world tonight, but you see this Son of God, because it's his world, he
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.520]   came into it. He's not going to let the devil destroy it. He'll come back and
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:08.120]   will destroy the devil and will restore in the grand regeneration the
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:13.360]   entire cosmos. And you know, if you believe in him and give your allegiance
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:18.360]   to him, you're going to share in that with him. If you are children, argues Paul
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:27.320]   in Romans 8, well then you are heir, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:33.080]   Christ, you know, has prepared for us an inheritance which is incorruptible and
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:40.600]   undefiled and that fadeth not away. You are Christ's and you share with him in
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:47.520]   this enjoyment of the inheritance. All things are yours. What on earth are you
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:53.080]   glorying in men for, says Paul, when in Christ all these things already belong to
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:57.120]   you? What does he mean? Well in a closing word, let me tell you what he does mean.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:03.400]   He says, if you are Christ's and you realize that and you glory in him, do you
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:08.880]   know, he says men will become your possession. Don't glory, he says, in me or
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:16.000]   in Apollos or in Cephas. Why not? Well he says, all things are yours. What things?
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:23.160]   Well Paul or Apollos or Cephas. You mustn't glory in us, says Paul, you know,
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:28.760]   you really own us, we are only your servants. Ourselves, you are servants for
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:33.560]   Jesus' sake. You remember what Paul says in writing his fourth chapter to the
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:38.160]   Ephesians? He says when Christ ascended into heaven, he gave gifts unto men. And
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:42.200]   what did he give the church? Some apostles, some prophets. He gave them as
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:48.600]   gifts to and for the church. Don't glory in me, says Paul, I'm your servant. You are
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:54.600]   our masters. Don't set us up as if we were dictators. There's no idea of a
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   Pope or any great Lord in the church in the New Testament. We don't lord it over
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:05.960]   God's inheritance, says Peter in his first epistle. No, no, we are your servants. So
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:12.760]   you see in Christ, the very apostles become your servants. What else? Well in a
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:20.280]   very wonderful way this is true of all other men also. Once you really glory in
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:25.640]   Christ and enter into this realization of what you are and what you have in him,
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:30.640]   you know, all men will become your servants. I rather like to think of this. I
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:36.200]   quoted Shakespeare just now, that great men, you know, he's my servant. I use him
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:40.160]   when I want to, and I can put him down when I don't want him. All things are
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:43.680]   yours. You're Shakespeare's, you're brilliant philosophers, they're all mine.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:48.280]   I don't sit trembling beneath them. I look down upon them. These are gifts
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.780]   given to men in order that they may help the children of God. They're not my
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:58.480]   masters. I use them. All things are yours. And he says it's same exactly with the
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.840]   world. Don't be a slave of the world, says Paul, because the world is yours.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:08.620]   Blessed are the meek, says our Lord, for they shall inherit the earth. When a man
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:13.360]   becomes a Christian, his whole attitude to this world becomes entirely different.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:19.000]   He really begins to see it for the first time as it really is. Listen to a man
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.120]   saying this, "Heaven above is softer blue, earth around is sweeter green, something
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:31.840]   lives in every hue. Christless eyes have never seen birds with glitters, songs or
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:40.920]   flow, flowers with deeper beauty shine. Since I know, as now I know, I am his and
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:47.120]   he is mine." I know a man who has a great estate in Britain. He's a man in the
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.720]   middle 70s who only became a Christian about six years ago, and this is what he
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.360]   said to me comparatively recently. "Do you know," he says, "since I've realized I'm a
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:02.120]   son of God, as I walk around my estate, it seems to me to be a new estate. I'm
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:08.160]   seeing things I never saw before." He's seeing the glory, the marvel, the wonder
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.800]   of the flowers and the animals and the brooks and the mountains. It's a new
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:20.760]   world. Why? Because he has got new eyes. The eyes of a man who is in Christ Jesus.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:27.480]   The world becomes our servant. It's our position and no longer our master, and
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:33.360]   it's exactly the same with regard to life. Oh, the modern man, he's tragically
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:38.400]   afraid of life, and so afraid he has to resort to drugs and to drink and to
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:42.680]   various other things. But you know, when a man becomes a Christian and glories in
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:49.320]   Christ, he says, "To me to live is Christ." This isn't the meaning of life. Look at
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:55.420]   Paul in prison and sent for one day before King Agrippa and the Roman
[00:59:55.420 --> 01:00:01.280]   governor Festus. There they are seated in their pump upon their great seats, and he
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.320]   stands before them with chains hanging heavily from his wrists, the poor
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.640]   prisoner. And you remember what he said to them? Well, he'd said certain things,
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.560]   and Agrippa said to him, "Almost thou makest me to be a Christian, with very
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.360]   little arguing. You think you can make me a Christian?" And Paul looked at him and
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.680]   said, "I would to God that you and all who are listening to me were both all
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:29.960]   together, and indeed as I am, apart from these bonds." You know, when a man
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.880]   becomes a Christian, he's immune to circumstances. The poor man who is not a
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.320]   Christian, he's dependent upon circumstances. He is the slave of
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:45.240]   circumstances. The Apostle Paul had gone out of that state. He was the master of
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:51.400]   life. It doesn't matter where he is, he is the Lord of his life, even in a prison.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:57.080]   No longer the slave, but the master. And it's exactly the same with death. Death
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:03.880]   is no longer a tyrant to the Christian. To me, to live is Christ, and to die is
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:10.240]   gain. To be with Christ, which is far better. The Christian is not afraid of
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.640]   death. Death to the Christian is just a little rivulet that separates this land
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:21.520]   of sin and woe from that land of pure delights where saints immortal reign.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.800]   Look at Paul again in prison. He writes to Timothy who was worried about him.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.080]   Timothy says, "Don't worry about me. Pull yourself together." "I know whom I have
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.600]   believed, and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.440]   unto him against that day." "Don't worry about me," says Paul. "The time of my
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:47.960]   departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight. I have kept the faith. Henceforth
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:53.400]   there is laid up for me in heaven the crown of righteousness, which he, the
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:58.680]   righteous judge, shall give unto me, and not only unto me, but unto all who love
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.480]   his appearing." This is the way in which the Christian faces death. It's no longer
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:09.640]   a tyrant. He stands above it. He owns it. It's under him. All things are yours, not
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   only life but also death. And it's the same with the present. It is the same with
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.520]   regard to the future. The Christian is able to say this, "All things work
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:31.760]   together for good to them that love God." All things. Look at Paul once more. He
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.680]   writes to this second letter to these Corinthians, and this is what he says.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.360]   He's having terrible troubles and trials in all directions. This is how he
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.640]   describes them. "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:53.960]   a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.960]   which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:04.560]   seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Or hear him
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:13.320]   again, I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content. I know both
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:20.520]   how to be abased, and I know how to abound. I can do all things through Christ,
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:27.000]   which strengthens me. Slave of the present, slave of the future? Of course not.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.280]   He's the master of all. All things are his, whether the world or life or death,
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:40.400]   or things present or things to come. Indeed this is the confession of the
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:48.160]   Christian at all times. In heavenly love abiding, what change my heart shall fear?
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:55.360]   And safe is such confiding, for nothing changes here. The storm may roar without
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:04.880]   me, my heart may low be made, but God is round about me. And can I be dismayed?
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:13.760]   Wherever he may guide me, no lack shall turn me back. My shepherd is beside me,
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:24.720]   and nothing can I lack. His wisdom never faileth, his sight is never dim. He knows
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:36.240]   the way he taketh, and I will walk with him. Green pastures are before me, white
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:45.160]   yet I have not seen. Bright skies shall soon be all me, where the dark cloud hath
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:58.520]   been. My hope I cannot measure, my path to life is free. My Savior has my treasure,
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:13.240]   and he will walk with me. All things are mine, because I am Christ's, and Christ is
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:26.080]   God's. From him who loves me now so well, what power my soul can sever? Shall life
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:46.120]   or death or earth or hell? No, I am his forever. Are you? You are either glorying
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:54.320]   in me, or else you are glorying in the Lord Jesus Christ. Glory in me, and you
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:06:02.760]   will continue a slave, and the slavery will increase. Glory in the Lord Jesus
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:15.120]   Christ, and he will set you free, and make you with himself the owner, the heir of
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:24.680]   the whole cosmos. Children of God, and if children, then heirs of God, and joint
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:32.520]   heirs with Christ. My dear friend, are you deceiving yourself? Are you allowing the
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:40.320]   world to deceive you? Are you a fool? Look at these things again in the light of your
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:47.360]   world that is round and about you, and see that the essence of wisdom is to
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:54.480]   become a fool, to become a Christian, to be laughed at by the world, but in reality
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:05.000]   to be made wise with the wisdom of God himself. Let us pray.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.680]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
