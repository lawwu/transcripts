[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Pastor John, here's a common question we hear on Bible reading, and it comes from
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.560]   a mom who asks, "Pastor John, I'm a busy mom with three kids at home. How am I
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.880]   supposed to find time to read the Bible alone?" What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.720]   Here's the way I want to approach this. If you're a wife in this situation, and
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.760]   not a single mom, that's another challenge. I'll mention that in a minute
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.840]   maybe, but a wife who has a husband living with her at home. Would you turn
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.920]   this podcast off and go get your husband? Because I'm gonna ask him to take
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.040]   responsibility for this question. You do have some responsibility. Yes, yes, you do.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.760]   And maybe I'll say a word about that in just a minute, but God's idea for
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.360]   marriage and parenting is two parents. That's His ideal. And one of the reasons
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.440]   for this is so that one can cover for the other and make sure that both are
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.360]   connecting with God through Jesus in the Word every day. Okay, good. So is he there?
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.760]   Like, is he there? I'm talking to the husband. Hello, husband. Your wife wants to
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.880]   know how she's supposed to find time to read the Bible alone when these kids are
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.720]   needing her attention all the time. So here's how I think you, Mr. Husband, can
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.000]   help her. Number one, set a tone of discipline and order in the home so that
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.600]   children are not running wild, but are submissive and obedient and self-control.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.520]   Partner with her in getting these kids under control. This calls for serious,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.760]   close attention from the time they can bite her nipple. It is possible to show
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.680]   them, "Don't do that. That's not allowed here." So naps and bedtimes and mealtimes
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.040]   are ordered times around which days can be built. My impression is way too many
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.200]   parents today think their children should be allowed to control the
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.320]   atmosphere of the house. That's a big mistake at lots of levels, I think. So,
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.280]   Dad, step up, partner with your wife in establishing routines, and expect
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.880]   obedience, expect submission to her and to your authority. That's number one. The
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.520]   whole atmosphere of the house has to be brought under the parental order. Number
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.720]   two, Dad, establish a playtime with the kids every day. It'll obviously change
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.920]   with the ages and so on, but give your whole attention to these kids every day
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.160]   at some point during which time she's free. For us, that was right after supper
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.120]   for about an hour for a long, many, many years. So from we ate at 530, we're done
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.680]   by 6, from 6 to 7, I'm playing with all the kids, managing it myself. She's done
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.880]   it all day. I can do it for an hour, and she can do whatever she wants, and if
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.040]   it's time to read the Bible, there she has it. Number three, build retreats into
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.120]   your and your wife's life so that she gets a half a day or a day every now and
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.400]   then. You figure out how often. When you arrange for the children, either you take
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.080]   them on Saturday morning, all morning, or you pay someone to do it, but she and you
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.440]   are getting these periodic extended retreat times where they can really
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.280]   kick back and deal with the living God. Number four, lead your wife in the Word
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.680]   so that her desire never wavers because of your example of pursuing treasure and
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.640]   sweetness in the Word with her. Number five, give her adult conversation about
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.560]   important things, including things from the Scripture, so that she doesn't lose
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:16.960]   perspective what all this kid time is for. And finally, pray for her, for her
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.360]   motivation and her discipline and her enjoyment of the Word. And a closing word
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.400]   maybe to mom, because I said I might get back to it, so here I am trying to get
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.920]   back to it. You may not have a husband with that kind of a heart. Well then, you
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.040]   must do it yourself, and God will help you. Yes, he will. No temptation or trial
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.120]   is going to fall on you that God won't give you the grace to endure. So you
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.800]   might try reading the story of Susanna Wesley, the mother of Charles and John
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.440]   Wesley. She had 19 children, nine of them died in infancy, that left ten. She
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.360]   promised the Lord she would spend time in prayer and the Word every day, and at
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.620]   one point her strategy was this, she taught the older children and the
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.200]   younger, that the younger ones were responsible to them, and when you see
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.860]   mom with an apron over her head at the table, don't bother her. Keep the kids
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.560]   quiet. That is my time with God. So train your children with that kind of rigor,
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:34.040]   expect obedience, find your apron or your closet, but dad, I'm looking to you for
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.520]   the major support. Thank you, Pastor John, and it's a big week for us at DG. Tomorrow
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.200]   we kick off our 2014 National Conference at the Minneapolis Convention Center. It
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.240]   will be our 12th National Conference, and it will also be our final National
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.400]   Conference. It's titled, "Look at the Book, Reading the Bible for Yourself," and it
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.520]   all begins Friday afternoon with seminars from Jerry Bridges, Nancy
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.560]   Guthrie, Ben Stewart, John Bloom, Jason Meyer, and others. Friday evening, you,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.940]   Pastor John, will be delivering your first of five sessions titled, "Scripture,
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.040]   the Kindling of Christian Hedonism." And if you can't be there, you can watch the
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.200]   conference online at DesiringGod.org/live. Well, a podcast listener
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.640]   writes in to ask, "What do you do when much of the Bible simply doesn't make
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.680]   any sense?" We'll hear Pastor John tomorrow. I'm your host Tony Rehnke. Thanks for
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.240]   listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
