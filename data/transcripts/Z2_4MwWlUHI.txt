[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660]   me and another reporter, David Kessenbaum and I went, we bought falafel and like a smoothie.
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.700]   And this was when Bitcoin was like, I don't know, 20, $20 for one Bitcoin, you know?
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.060]   And so, yeah, I mean, well, it's cheaper now than it was six months ago, right?
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.880]   Six months ago, it was a $50,000 lunch and now it's a $20,000 lunch.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.940]   So if it keeps going, maybe it'll get back to normal.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:30.460]   I mean, that does, to your earlier question about money and crypto, like money doesn't
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.060]   work that way.
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.540]   You don't regret buying a sandwich because the value of money, it actually appreciated
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.540]   so much.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.540]   You don't hodl money.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.540]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180]   That's not what money is for.
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:53.700]   And so, you know, on a simple level, it demonstrates the extent to which certainly Bitcoin is not
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.700]   money.
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.600]   And I think the closest thing to money in crypto, sort of ironically, given the history,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.760]   is stable coins, right?
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.980]   Which is funny given that like so much of the sort of crypto noise is about the unreliability
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.520]   of the dollar, that the thing that actually functions like money is the thing that is
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   pegged to the dollar.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.060]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.900]   money, and travel.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.540]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.880]   all the research to get the best experience in life without the expensive price tag.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.940]   That means optimizing travel, think flights, hotels, points, miles, money, think savings,
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.620]   investing, and getting deals, as well as life and work.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.380]   Think happiness, leadership, negotiation, and so much more.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.700]   To make this happen, I sit down with the world's best experts each week to learn the strategies,
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.300]   tactics, and frameworks that shaped their success.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.940]   And this week, I'm talking to podcasting legend, Jacob Goldstein.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.460]   Many of you know him as an NPR correspondent and the co-host of Planet Money for over a
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.460]   decade.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.940]   Before NPR, he was a staff writer at the Wall Street Journal, and he recently published
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.420]   his first book, Money, The True Story of a Made-Up Thing, which is a fascinating look
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.980]   at the history of how money came to be.
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.780]   Finally, he just launched a new podcast this year called What's Your Problem, where he
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.140]   interviews founders and CEOs about how they solve the world's hardest problems.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.240]   Our conversation today will be all about money, including what's going on with inflation,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.500]   what you can do about it, the genesis of money, and what might be in store for its future,
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.460]   including how crypto might fit in.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.780]   I'll also make sure to get some of Jacob's favorite money hacks along the way.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.780]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.140]   Jacob, welcome to the podcast.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.140]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.140]   Hi.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.300]   You've written a lot about inflation, and that it's often based on what people think
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.880]   and whether they think there should be inflation.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.380]   So I'm curious if you think what we're in right now is a self-fulfilling prophecy of
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.940]   what people think that just will get compoundingly worse, or is this different because we kind
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.480]   of have these supply chain issues and the Russian gas stuff?
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.740]   So I hope it's not a self-fulfilling, compounding prophecy where it's just going to get worse,
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.740]   right?
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.740]   And it may not be.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.620]   That is maybe like the most important macroeconomic question for the sort of medium term, you
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:29.080]   know, for the next year, couple years term, is do people expect inflation to stay high?
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.480]   And there is this weird thing about inflation, which is inflation expectations, what people
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.380]   think inflation is going to do, has a huge effect on what inflation actually does, right?
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.200]   And for a long time, a sort of bizarrely long time, we lived in this world where we had
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.160]   persistently really low inflation, right?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.040]   After the financial crisis, through the aughts, into the teens, whereby like 2019, we were
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.280]   in this world where unemployment was super low, the economy was doing well, the government
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.200]   was borrowing tons of money, and all of those things you would think would give you higher
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   inflation, right?
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.600]   That classically is a really inflationary environment and we didn't see it.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.340]   And part of the reason it seems, it's kind of a mystery why we didn't see it, but part
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.000]   of the reason it seems is because people expected it would stay low.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.440]   So now what do people think?
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.240]   I mean, you can look at the markets, you know, you can look at various financial markets
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.840]   and people don't think inflation is going to stay at 8% for like five years.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.100]   So that's kind of encouraging.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.560]   So I'm hoping people's expectations are still kind of moderate.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.080]   I was doing some quick math, looking at what is inflation been like in some countries.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.680]   And if you go back and look, Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, 8% seems like nothing.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.360]   But even right now, Turkey is like in the 50%.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.440]   So is 8% really that unreasonable?
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.600]   Inflation is weird because it can be nonlinear, right?
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:58.420]   And it's useful to distinguish 8%, high inflation that we have now from your, certainly Venezuela,
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.540]   Zimbabwe is where it was like thousands of percent.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.340]   So it was just runaway.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.420]   And also Turkey, whereas you say it's 50%.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:11.500]   I mean, in those runaway cases, in those Venezuela, Zimbabwe cases, it's not just inflation.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.100]   It's basically an economic collapse, right?
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.760]   And the inflation is as much or more an effect, a symptom of the underlying collapse as the
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.800]   cause, right?
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.600]   We don't have that.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.360]   We're not going to be Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.120]   And if somebody says that, it means they don't know what they're talking about.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.200]   But 8% inflation is bad.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.040]   I mean, one thing that's really striking is people just hate it, right?
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.680]   Like people really hate inflation.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.100]   And the other simple thing is real wages are going down, right?
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.580]   If you look at how much wages are going up versus inflation, inflation is going up faster
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.700]   than wages.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.060]   And that doesn't usually happen, especially when the economy is growing.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.020]   And that means people are getting poorer.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.700]   And it's bad when people are getting poor.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.180]   That's the simple reason of why inflation is bad.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.580]   It is a basket of goods, and some of them can have an outweighed impact.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.160]   Are there any areas that you're aware of right now that aren't really doing as poorly, where
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.700]   it might actually be-- I know fuel prices are driving inflation significantly.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.740]   Yeah, so it's interesting to think about the different components of inflation.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.620]   Fuel is obviously the most salient one, right?
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.260]   Gas, gas prices.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.740]   And gas prices are really interesting.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.020]   So if you look at the sort of budget, the typical household budget, which is like the
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.500]   inflation basket, all the stuff a typical family buys.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.660]   Gas is somewhere around like 5%.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.480]   So it's not that much, right?
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.340]   But one, the price of gas went up way more than the price of basically anything else,
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340]   right?
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.340]   It essentially doubled.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.820]   And the price of nothing else really doubled.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.260]   Two, and this is-- two is psychological, right?
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.620]   You see gas prices in like giant numbers as you're driving around.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.180]   You stand there pumping the gas in your car, and you see the numbers going up in front
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.180]   of you.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.020]   And so it has a disproportionate impact on people's awareness, right?
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.240]   People freak out about gas prices in a way that they don't freak out about, say, health
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.240]   care, right?
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.340]   Health care prices, in fact, right now are not going up that fast, not going up as fast
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.020]   as I think the rest of inflation.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.140]   I haven't checked on that number in a while.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.480]   And health care is a bigger chunk of the household spending basket than gas.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.900]   But it's like the opposite in terms of salience, right?
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.500]   Like if you have a job, and you get health insurance through your job, your employer
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.420]   is just straight up paying a bunch of your health insurance premium.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.820]   So you don't even see that.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.100]   And then the part that you're paying comes out of your paycheck.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.780]   So you don't really notice it unless you're like looking through all the stuff, you know,
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.820]   on the gross part of your paycheck that's not flowing through to the net.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.120]   So it's like health care is like the least salient part.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.960]   And interestingly, it's a place where at this moment, inflation is relatively low.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.300]   So those are kind of two poles.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.820]   And to the point I made earlier about people's expectations.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.540]   One thing that I kind of personally am fearing is there's kind of a everyone assumes inflation
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.540]   is high right now.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.460]   Maybe even people are assuming it's higher than it actually is, right?
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.980]   If you see gas prices double, that's not 8%.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.740]   And when they report 8%, they're annualizing a number, right?
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.260]   So it's like if it went up 1% in a month, it would be 12% reported.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.260]   Yes.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.460]   Well, sometimes they're doing year over year, they do do the month over month.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.460]   But the typical annual number they're doing the year over year.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.220]   But they're not saying in May, prices went up 9% or 8%?
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.220]   They're not.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.940]   They're saying between May of 2021 and 2022, prices went up 9%.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.060]   People traditionally, like there are surveys, people traditionally think inflation is higher
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.720]   than it is, you know, at baseline.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.800]   So does that give restaurants kind of permission, even if their underlying food costs haven't
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.740]   gone up 10 or 15%, you know, are they like, "Oh, you know, we might as well raise prices
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.740]   right now.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.420]   Everyone's going to accept it because everyone assumes prices are going up."
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.820]   And it kind of creates this, "Okay, well, now food prices are up."
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.940]   And everyone's like, "Oh, now I need, you know, to work an extra job, or I need to demand
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.940]   for my employer."
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.420]   And employers are like, "Well, if we're going to pay people, we got to raise our prices."
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.380]   And even though the underlying food might not be getting it as expensive.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.220]   Well, so there's a lot in that question, and it's worth unpacking it, right?
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:28.400]   So one part of that question is, can businesses sort of sneak in price hikes under the sort
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.420]   of veil of broader inflation, right?
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.260]   And it's an interesting question to think about.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:39.100]   I mean, I personally am a price conscious consumer, right?
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.100]   Like I like a deal.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.100]   I know what I'm paying.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.180]   I look at the price before I buy things.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:50.000]   And you know, we want businesses to be competing against each other all the time, right?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.880]   Inflation is good for consumers.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:58.600]   And so if, you know, when we order in, we usually order in Thai, right?
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.120]   And there's two or three Thai restaurants that we order from, and they're like pretty
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   similar.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.600]   And if one of them suddenly got more expensive, I would just start ordering in from the other
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   one, right?
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   So they're competing on price.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.240]   And so if they colluded, they could raise prices, but that's always true, right?
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.600]   I assume they're not colluding.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.440]   So I don't think there is that much room for that.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.160]   I mean, what there is, and this is the, you know, important, I think most important piece
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.940]   of inflation right now is not expectations.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.020]   That's important for the long run.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.200]   But as you alluded to earlier, you know, basic supply and demand are the two drivers right
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   now.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.340]   There's, you know, less supply certainly of oil, to some extent of food, both because
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:40.960]   of the war in Ukraine, and then to some extent manufactured goods, because China has been
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.440]   doing this, you know, COVID zero extreme lockdowns.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.320]   And so their manufacturing output has declined.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.880]   So that's less supply.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.200]   And then demand is high.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.160]   And that's important for price increases, right?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.400]   Demand is high because, weirdly, it doesn't feel like it, but the economy has been really
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   strong.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.320]   I mean, it feels like all of a sudden, it's like, whoa, are we in a recession?
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.200]   But unemployment is below 4%.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.360]   Savings is really high for US households.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.480]   And so people are willing to pay more, right?
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.820]   And that piece goes to your question.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.600]   People are willing to pay more because they have more money, and also because their wages
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   are going up.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.240]   Their wages are going up faster than they've gone up for a long time, just not as fast
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.240]   as inflation.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.400]   So demand is high.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.280]   So that allows, that does allow companies to raise prices.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.560]   But we hope that's constrained by competition.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.040]   Let's talk about one thing that you mentioned to me right before we rolled.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.480]   Inflation can be a good thing for a certain type of product.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.680]   I'll let you, I won't steal your lead.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.760]   For sure, for a certain type of person.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:47.040]   If you have debt, and your debt is at a fixed interest rate, not a variable interest rate,
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.280]   inflation on average makes it easier to pay off that debt, right?
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.760]   Like as I mentioned, wages are going up really fast, faster than they've gone up in a long
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.760]   time.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.720]   And that is partly a result of inflation, right?
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.360]   Prices of everything are going up.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.520]   And labor is a price.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.000]   We don't think of it as a price, but it is, right?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.360]   When you go to work, you are selling your labor.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.120]   And the price of labor is going up.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120]   And so that's good.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.320]   If you are a person who sells labor for a living, it means you're getting more money.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:22.440]   And notably, if you have a student loan or a mortgage, that is at a fixed interest rate.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:30.220]   I have a mortgage that's at 2.9%, not to brag, but I was fortunate to buy a house last year.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.800]   So my wages are going up.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.960]   My mortgage payment is staying the same.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.920]   So what that means is as my wage goes up, I have to work less to make the same mortgage
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.000]   payment, right?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.040]   So that's good for me.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.780]   And it's bad for the bank, frankly, right?
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.060]   They're getting paid back in dollars that are less valuable.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.300]   The higher inflation, the less each dollar I pay the bank buys.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.880]   So like it's definitely a win for debtors, although, you know, obviously in a limited
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   way.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.640]   And people get mad when you say that because nobody wants to hear that anything is good
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   about inflation.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.920]   Well, I mean, I'll give an example.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.560]   So I bought a car and it was a Tesla that I've been waiting a year for, and it was kind
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.080]   of two crazy things.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.680]   One, you could see the inflation because Tesla, thankfully, locks in the price when you buy
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   it.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   So when I put in the order for it last year, it was locked in at one price and that price
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.640]   went up about 20% since I ordered it.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   So when I went to...
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.480]   Could you have just sold it back to the dealer for more than you paid for it?
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.560]   Well, here's the crazy thing.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.440]   I was thinking the price today is 20% higher and you have to wait a year.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.120]   So I was like, "Man, if I could sell my place in line, someone would presumably pay more
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.520]   than 20% because they would get it now instead of a year from now."
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.920]   And then I thought, "Gosh, if only Tesla reservations were on the blockchain and it was easy to
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920]   transfer."
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   But we can get there.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   It wouldn't have to be on the blockchain.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   It wouldn't have to be on the blockchain.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   I know.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   I know.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   It's just what came to my mind living in Silicon Valley.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.240]   I mean, if anybody was going to put reservations on the blockchain, it would be Tesla, right?
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.120]   If only you'd paid a doge.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.120]   Oh man.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.600]   If you paid a doge, you'd be screwed.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.160]   So I was looking for a loan.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.000]   I was looking for a loan and I will share one tip for anyone listening.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.220]   You do not need to finance your vehicle with the company you buy the car from.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.640]   Many people had told me, "Oh, what's Tesla's rate?"
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.960]   I was like, "Well, I shopped my rate online and I went and looked at tons of credit unions
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.860]   around the country and some of whom only adjust their rates monthly, some of whom don't really
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.640]   adjust them at all.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:37.780]   And the range of rates I saw were anywhere from three, 4% for Tesla, I think was at 3.74
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.880]   to the lowest rate I could find for a five to six year loan was 1.99%.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.600]   1.99 is really low for a five year loan right now.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   That's amazing.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   And that's now.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.920]   That's in this, when a mortgage is, what is a mortgage now?
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   Five or six, right?
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.840]   It made no sense to me, right?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.460]   High yield savings accounts right now are paying, I know the Wealthfront Cash Account
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.460]   is at 1.4%.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.820]   I was like, "Gosh, you're almost at the point where if rates go up as expected, over the
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.820]   next few months."
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.300]   We're just two or three year treasuries, right?
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.420]   Two or three year treasuries are at what 3% or something last I checked.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.460]   So I mean, there is a tax thing there, but yeah, it's obviously a sweet deal to finance
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.460]   at 1.99%.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.460]   But it's pretty close.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.580]   We're not that far away from the ability to earn more than your loan cost if you locked
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.580]   it in.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.660]   And so for anyone listening, definitely go look around.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.540]   I might even link to this Tesla Google sheet where people that are from some Tesla forum
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.940]   put every credit union, all the deals there.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:41.740]   I went to credit union one, had a great experience, highly recommend it, but I locked it in.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.180]   They told me they could lock the rate in for 60 days.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.580]   And so I locked it in the morning of the Fed rate cut because I wanted the most time to
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.580]   buy the car.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.580]   You knew it was going to go up.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.580]   You knew it was going to go up.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.380]   You would think they would have known it too, right?
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.780]   It's interesting that it was so low, but you know, it means you're going to be paying that
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.140]   money back in dollars that are worth a lot less than dollars are worth now, right?
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:07.260]   A dollar four years from now when you're still paying off your loan is going to be worth,
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260]   you know, more than 10% less than a dollar today.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.700]   We don't know the path of inflation, but 15, 20% less, right?
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.860]   It could be a lot less.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.860]   Based on treasuries and everything, like it's definitely going to be worth less.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.260]   And the thing that blows my mind, there's a tool, the CME group has this tool on their
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.220]   website called the FedWatch tool.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.220]   I don't know if you've seen it.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.900]   And it shows the probabilities of rate hikes at different Fed meetings.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.860]   And the thing that I thought was so crazy was I'm literally going to pull it up here
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:42.780]   and it says, you know, by the end of the year, December 22nd, there is a 42.6% chance it
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.900]   will be in the 3.25 to 3.5% range.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.460]   And then a 34% chance it'll be 3.5 to 3.75 and then an 8%, it's 3.75 or more.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.380]   And to be clear, that rate is just the overnight rate, right?
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.500]   It's not a five-year rate.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   It's the overnight rate for the safest credit there is, basically.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.540]   So it's wild that it's going to be that much higher and that you were able to lock in a
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.940]   five-year loan at one point.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.780]   And it wasn't just one credit union.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.860]   Most of them were 1.99 to 2.5, even though people way smarter than me and spending more
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:20.940]   time on this than me are like 80-plus percent confident that rates will be in the 3% by
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.940]   the end of the year.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.580]   Yeah, it's interesting to think about what's going on on the credit union side, like why,
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.300]   like where are they getting the funding?
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.740]   I mean, I guess it's deposits, right?
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.500]   They're still paying zero on deposits.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.540]   Now, if deposit rates have to go up, then they might get underwater, right?
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.540]   That's a thing that has happened.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.460]   They might get screwed being on the other side of your loan.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.300]   But for now, they're paying 0% to get deposits and lending to you at 2%, I guess.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.340]   And that's why I think it's important for everyone to realize that most banks that are
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:54.700]   lending the money out to you, like most of the average Chase Bank of America, Wells Fargo,
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.220]   they're paying no interest on their savings accounts.
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.260]   I'm sure they're still playing, it's close to zero, isn't it?
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.380]   And checking accounts, I mean, we've forgotten now, but checking accounts used to pay interest.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.820]   Oh, yeah, you cannot, it is hard to get interest at a brick and mortar bank these days.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.820]   So as inflation rises, I was going to ask you what you're doing to prepare for inflation,
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:22.060]   but I'll share one thing, which is as inflation rises, and different institutions are paying
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:28.140]   over 1%, or hopefully in the future, over 2% or 3% on savings, leaving your money at
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.140]   a place paying 0% is not a great idea.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.980]   I'm curious what you might be doing.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.460]   I mean, so a couple of things, right?
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.340]   And as I mentioned, I bought a house a year ago, before that, I was saving a down payment,
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.340]   right?
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.500]   So enough money to make it worth, enough cash to make it worth sort of shopping around.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:51.020]   And I used American Express has an online high yield savings account.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.900]   And it went to zero during the pandemic when everything else went to zero.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.380]   But that one, I think it's back up, a lot of them like it.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.580]   I think I saw an ad for Marcus, which is Goldman Sachs sort of consumer facing online bank.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.020]   So there are a lot of just FDIC insured, you know, totally liquid, put it in today, take
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.580]   it out whenever you want that are up around 1% now.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.580]   I mean, my favorite one, I don't know if you've talked about it on the show.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.100]   Have you talked about IBONS on the show?
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.260]   I've written about IBONS in my newsletter.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:23.520]   And I'm doing an AMA episode where people are asking where to put cash right now.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   And IBONS was the answer.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   We haven't talked about them.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   So we could just go now.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.300]   And I could just skip that on the AMA.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.500]   Well, I don't want to, I don't want to step on.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.500]   I don't know.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   But it's my favorite answer.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.020]   It's the thing that I'm most, like, I don't generally believe in tips.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:43.180]   You know, my basic investing tip is always just like, buy, buy index funds, right?
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.060]   Just buy index funds and look away.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.260]   Don't do anything because whatever you do, you could do the wrong thing.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.020]   We could talk about tax loss harvesting, right?
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:58.220]   But anyways, so my big hack with money that I'm excited about now is IBONS.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.260]   You obviously know about them too, so we can both talk about them.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.260]   What are they?
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.260]   Let me ask you.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.260]   What's an IBONS?
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.820]   So the government has these bonds that they issue.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.340]   It's a series I savings bond.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.180]   You know, you can only buy them on a terrible website, TreasuryDirect, or.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.640]   So bad though, so bad.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.740]   It's literally, for anyone who hasn't used it, the only way you can enter your password
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.500]   is through a virtual keyboard that you have to click with each letter with your mouse.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.100]   It's really hard.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.060]   Or I think you can still buy them paper ones with your tax refund.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.060]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.220]   So, so yes, up to.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.500]   So you can buy them and there's limits on how much you can buy.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:42.340]   You can buy up to $5,000 with a tax refund and up to $10,000 just straight up on the
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.540]   terrible website.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.740]   I should also make a distinction.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:51.240]   Sometimes people confuse them with with TIPS, which are Treasury Inflation Protected Securities,
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   I think it stands for.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   But it's a different thing.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.980]   And those are like a regular market.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:21:01.980]   The amazing thing about IBONs is basically they are guaranteed to pay an interest rate
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.020]   that keeps up with inflation.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.660]   Essentially, there's some formula, but that's basically what it is.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.200]   Yeah, they have a they have a rate that right now I think is actually zero.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.520]   That is like the base rate.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.260]   And then they add on every six months, they change whatever the current inflation rate
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.260]   is.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:24.560]   So from May, May 2022 to October, if you get one, you'll get the first six months, you'll
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.520]   get nine point six, two percent interest.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:33.980]   And we should just pause and wave our hands at nine point six, two percent interest, right?
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:39.260]   Like this is the most safe, you know, borrow.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.420]   You're lending your money to the government, the safest thing you can do with it.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.240]   You have to leave it in for a year, essentially.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.060]   There's like a small penalty if you take it out less than five years, you have to leave
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.100]   it in for a year.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:55.620]   But getting nine point six percent interest from the government guaranteed is extraordinary.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.360]   And I should add, depending on how fortunate you are, how much cash you have.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.500]   So it's limited to ten thousand per person per year.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.300]   But you can also open an account for your kid or your kids.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:11.660]   So I actually I opened one for each of my daughters and I and I bought the Max last
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.620]   year and I bought the Max this year.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.980]   And you know, I mean, I also have a lot of money in the stock market that I've watched
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.980]   go down.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.780]   And it's like to me, I now have a non-trivial amount of money that is very safely and comfortably
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.780]   going up.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.820]   And it just makes me happy to think about it.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.820]   We did the same.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:32.260]   If you have a revocable trust, which in an episode recently we talked about, you know,
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.940]   is not the same thing as these crazy high net worth trust.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.020]   It's a pretty basic legal document that can be another entity.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.100]   And so you could do another one there.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.460]   So you know, if you had a family of four, you could conceivably put five that fifty
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:51.300]   thousand five, ten thousand dollar savings, series I savings bonds or bonds in a year,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.020]   which is a real amount of money.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:23:01.140]   It's a lot, even if inflation goes to zero before the end of the year, which I think
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.080]   is very unlikely personally.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.580]   But even if inflation went to zero, you would earn nine point six two percent for the first
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.900]   six months or four point eight one because, you know, it's an annualized rate and then
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.900]   zero on the rest of the year.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:21.300]   So even earning four point eight one percent is a much larger number than any other government
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.560]   backed place I've seen.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.220]   You could invest money for, you know, less for a one year horizon.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.220]   Other side.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.220]   Right.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:32.620]   If inflation keeps going up, the interest rate you receive, you know, it resets, as
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.540]   you said, every what is it, six months?
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.900]   It keeps going up.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.660]   So like.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.460]   It's a wildly like it shouldn't exist, right?
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.660]   Like it's a weird it's like a loophole because like.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.860]   I have to assume the reason there is a cap is because this is not a profitable endeavor
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.860]   for the U.S. government.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.500]   No, it doesn't make any sense, right?
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.500]   People are like the rate on on, you know, these kinds of.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.380]   They borrow most of their money, you know, from the market and the market will will accept
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.500]   a profoundly lower rate of interest.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.460]   So I mean, I think the idea is to encourage saving, right?
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.460]   Their savings bonds, right?
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.660]   Like if you're old enough, like when I was a kid, you know, like your uncle would give
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.820]   you like a hundred dollar savings bond and they would pay fifty dollars for it.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.860]   And the idea is like you hold it for ten years and then you can cash it in for a hundred
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.860]   or something.
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.980]   And I think this is the sort of legacy of that.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.440]   Yeah, well, it's a real hack, though.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   Like I feel good.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.060]   I feel like I'm bringing a hack to the show with that one.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.340]   I totally agree.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.020]   And you talked about things not making sense that the government does with money, which
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.860]   is a great thing I wanted to talk about.
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.280]   In a past episode, I talked with someone about charisma, Vanessa Van Edwards, and we talked
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.820]   about how it was this thing that everyone kind of knows.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.560]   But when you actually try to say like, what is it really?
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.020]   People can very rarely answer the question.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.100]   The answer she found was that it's a balance of warmth and competence.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.700]   But you know, I was thinking about money and your book made me think, gosh, money is kind
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.700]   of similar.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.220]   It's this thing that, you know, you did an interview on This American Life for an episode.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:09.460]   Ira Glass called what is money the most stoner question he'd ever posed on the on the show.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.540]   And it made me think, gosh, it's this thing that we all know what it is, but like, what
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.620]   is it really?
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.960]   And that led you to write an entire book.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:21.140]   So I'm going to just ask you now that you're the expert, like what what is money?
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:27.580]   The reason it seemed interesting enough to me to write a book about is at a more complex
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:33.020]   level, the answer to that question has changed an incredible amount over time, right?
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.140]   The book is a history book, basically.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:40.580]   It's like a series of origin stories, really, of of money.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:49.540]   And the really striking thing to me, I think, at the root is at any given moment.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.700]   What money is just seems like the natural state of the world, right?
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.060]   Like most people most of the time don't really think about it.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.780]   They just think, oh, yes, this piece of paper, my wallet, this number in my account, that's
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.920]   what money is fine, whatever.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.380]   That's just the way the world works.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:10.260]   But the lesson, the insight to me that was really interesting, exciting is it's not necessarily
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.260]   the way the world works.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.380]   It didn't used to work that way.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.380]   It'll probably be different in the future.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.980]   And so that's that's what's fun.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:22.060]   Money turns out to be this, you know, set of rules, the set of arrangements that a society
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.680]   agrees on without really realizing that they're agreeing on something.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.100]   Quite often it is kind of emergent and they're like it's kind of bottom up more than you
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.020]   might think, rather than, you know, let's have a constitutional convention and decide
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.220]   what money is.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.800]   So we're not going to go through the entire history because there's a wonderful book that
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.500]   I read in advance of this.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.180]   Yeah, you can read it first.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.540]   But where did it all start?
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.460]   I think I didn't think it started where it did.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:53.340]   And I'd love at least that story to jump in here and let people get a little glimpse.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.340]   So.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:59.780]   There's where, like the best guess now of where it started, and then there's what people
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:00.780]   always thought.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.780]   Right.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.340]   And it's interesting to to distinguish between them.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:09.700]   For a long time, there was this sort of a parable, almost a kind of just so story that
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.000]   people told about the origin of money.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.360]   And that was, you know, before there was money, there was barter, right, trade.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:24.340]   And barter was inconvenient because for you and me to make an exchange, not only did I
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.180]   have to have something that you want, but you also had to have something that I want.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.180]   Right.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.540]   So maybe I've got a thing and you want my thing, but you don't have anything that I
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.540]   want.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.540]   So we can't make a deal.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.540]   Right.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.340]   And that sucks because it would be good if we could make a deal.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.460]   It'd be good for me and it would be good for you.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.820]   And money solves that problem.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.820]   Right.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.100]   Then if you want something I have, I don't care what stuff you have.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.320]   Just give me some of your money and I'll give you this thing that I have that you want.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   Right.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.620]   That's the traditional story of money emerged from barter.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:28:00.020]   The thing is in the 20th century, basically, anthropologists from largely Europe and the
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:06.660]   U.S. started going around the world and studying different societies in, you know, stages of
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.860]   development that people had imagined this kind of barter universe would exist in.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:17.100]   And what the anthropologists found was they weren't like that into barter.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:25.740]   What they were much more into was social agreements about like borrowing and lending and gift
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.340]   giving and reciprocity.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.340]   There were all these rules.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.340]   Right.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.860]   And so these are basically tribal societies.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.860]   Right.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.740]   They're small, you know, kinship based groups of people where everybody knows everybody
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.740]   else.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.620]   And there are lots of rules about exchange, essentially, you know, exchange of material
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.620]   goods.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.180]   Some of the sort of canonical cases have to do with marriage is a big one.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.780]   There are very often rules like if you're going to marry somebody, you know, you have
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.380]   to give their family, your family has to give their family cattle or your family has to
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:00.860]   give their family a certain kind of boar tusk or whatever.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.620]   Another one was around murder.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.620]   Kind of awesomely.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.620]   Lots of societies have rules where, like, if you kill somebody, then your family has
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.340]   to give their family, you know, typically same kind of stuff.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.620]   Cattle in a lot of places, cowry shells, whatever, some some prescribed thing.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:20.620]   And those things, those are really proto money.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.620]   Right.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.100]   Because once there's a thing where it's like, well, probably not going to murder somebody,
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.220]   but like my kid's probably going to get married and when my kid gets married, I'm going to
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.380]   need some cows to give to, you know, the bride's family or whatever.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:39.380]   That's really, I think, the best guess for the roots of money.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.300]   It reminds me of something I think you probably wrote in the book that said, you know, it's
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.020]   also money is what you have to pay your taxes with.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.940]   It's like the reason I care about having dollars in my bank account is because that every every
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.360]   April I have to send dollars to the U.S. government and they only accept that.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.360]   It's a good starting point.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:01.060]   And certainly in places and times where different things are sort of competing to be money,
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.700]   you know, that's a world we're not used to now.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.520]   But there have been times where that was the case.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.960]   If the government comes in and says, you will pay your taxes in this thing, and sometimes
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:15.460]   it was cloth and sometimes it was some currency, then that thing becomes like the cows you
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.820]   have to give for marriage, a thing everybody's going to need at some point.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.940]   And and yes, it becomes money.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.060]   I mean, one of the interesting things distinguishing between the sort of barter story and the,
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.820]   you know, marriage and murder story is the barter story is really this very cold, impersonal
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:36.300]   market story, which I think is like the typical sort of vibe we associate with money.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.860]   But it's really interesting to me to think about the other story, right, the murder and
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:46.200]   marriage story, because that's a much more like hot, social, interactive story of what
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   money is.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.420]   And that side of money, right, this social creation, this thing that works because we
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:58.040]   all agree to use something as money is a really interesting piece of it.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.420]   And I think underappreciated.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.500]   And you mentioned cattle as an example.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:07.260]   Cattle is not something easy to bring up and divide and all that divide.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.600]   No, no.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.500]   Is that ultimately what drove to the kind of creation of paper money was like, we just
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.860]   we can't I need something from you.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.700]   And a cattle is just too valuable.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.700]   How did we get because I don't think it was like overnight that we just switched there.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.740]   How did how did what happened then when you needed half a cattle?
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.740]   And how did we end up?
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:30.860]   Yeah, so, so, so paper was much later for sort of technical reasons.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.300]   Paper wasn't invented until like, I don't know, 1000 AD, hundreds of years AD.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.420]   But coins, coins came along first.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.700]   Coins came along around, I don't know, 600, 700 BC.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.160]   And the short answer to your question is yes.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.460]   But the longer answer to your question is, so, you know, before coins, whatever, if you
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:54.600]   go back to the ancient, ancient world, there were these small, you know, sort of tribal
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.060]   societies like we talked about.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.540]   And then there were bigger civilizations, right?
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:04.660]   If you think of the classic cradle of civilization, you know, the Eastern Mediterranean and those
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.580]   societies were very top down, right?
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:12.060]   They were like today we'd call them command and control economies, right?
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.700]   There was somebody there was a ruler, like a king or a queen or a priest or whatever.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.180]   And they would essentially direct the exchange of good.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.740]   They would, you know, take grains from the farmers and give them to the bureaucrats who
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.020]   worked at the temple or whatever.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:31.600]   So there was not a market exchange, or at least not to the extent at all that we're
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.600]   used to.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   Right?
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.180]   So, so there was a solution to like, how do you do exchange in a bigger civilization?
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.020]   Well, you just have a king take and give and decide what everybody's going to get.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:47.360]   But then the first place coins really took off was ancient Greece, interestingly.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.280]   And I think arguably, not coincidentally, certainly interestingly, around the time democracy
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.140]   was emerging, right?
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:59.420]   And what you had in ancient Greece, this is like, you know, classical Greece, the Olympics,
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:06.900]   the whole thing was something that was bigger and more complex than a tribal civilization/economy,
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.900]   but also a more bottom up power distribution than you had in these, you know, very top
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.900]   down kingdoms.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:20.500]   And so you needed some new way to do material exchange that was neither top down nor everybody
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.460]   knows everybody and we all share the same rules and coins, money was the perfect solution
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.680]   for that.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.220]   And back then and fast forward a lot longer than I thought.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:36.620]   So I was blown away reading that in the 1800s, we still had lots of different kinds of money.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.420]   It wasn't like we'd centralized on this is the kind.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.940]   So I'm intentionally fast forwarding because there's a book, go read the book.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:43.940]   I thought it was great.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.380]   We don't need to recap the entire book.
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:52.100]   But I'm going to make a hard turn from the conversation of the history of money and talk
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:58.460]   about maybe a little bit of the future, which was, I think you said there was 8,370 kinds
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.620]   of money somewhere in the mid 1800s in the US, and I thought, okay, right now it feels
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.500]   like if you talk to a lot of people, the future of money is something online and there's all
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.500]   these cryptocurrencies.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:13.220]   I was like, it feels like there's probably 8,370 different cryptocurrencies.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:21.340]   I'm curious what happened in that last, let's call it 200 years, watching money evolve from
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.480]   lots of different things to get more centralized.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.540]   Do you think anything like that plays out in the world of crypto and how do you think
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.060]   it falls into the world of money?
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.500]   I know it's a loaded question.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:36.060]   Yeah, no, it's an interesting question.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.380]   So let me just say a little thing about the moment you're alluding to in the 1800s and
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.680]   then we can jump to now because it'll help it make more sense.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:49.180]   So the way it worked in the US in the like 1830s, '40s, '50s was there was the dollar.
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:52.100]   The dollar was the unit of account, right?
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:57.380]   But private banks issued their own paper money and this was still the era when paper money
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.260]   was like a claim check for gold, right?
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.540]   The real value or silver, the real value was the precious metal.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.600]   And so there were in fact 8,000 different kinds of paper money because each bank issued
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.340]   different looking pieces of paper and it was wild and interesting.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.380]   And like you said, you can read all about it.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.100]   But still the underlying thing was the dollar.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.060]   So there are some elements that are similar to cryptocurrencies and some that are different
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.980]   and people have been writing about that.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:27.680]   I mean, the thing that has happened over the last couple hundred years is the government
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.820]   has gotten more and more power over money, right?
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:35.660]   Going off the gold standard in the 1930s gave the government much more power over money.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:40.780]   Doing deposit insurance for banks actually sort of gave the government a much bigger
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:41.820]   role in money.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:48.620]   And I think the central role that government has in money is like the most important thing
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.700]   both about money today and frankly in thinking about cryptocurrency in the context of, is
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.860]   it really going to be money?
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:01.920]   Are people really in a widespread way going to use crypto to buy and sell stuff?
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:07.020]   And I think it's unlikely that governments will relinquish their control over money,
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.020]   right?
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.940]   We basically have a monopoly on money now.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:17.260]   And yeah, you can find scattered use cases like ransom or people who want to move money
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:23.100]   out of countries like China where there are capital controls, where cryptocurrency has
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.580]   a clear use case.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:31.380]   It's striking to me how long in a sort of technology standpoint, Bitcoin has now existed,
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.380]   right?
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:38.860]   2008 was the white paper and I think 2009 was when the first block was minted.
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.380]   So that's a long time in a certain way for it to not really take off.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:47.980]   I remember I started covering Bitcoin in 2011 and at the time I was like, "Wow, this is
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.620]   really interesting.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.260]   Either it'll work and be this wild new thing or it won't work and it'll kind of go away."
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.900]   And the surprising thing to me is I was wrong on both of them.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.660]   It didn't really work and it totally didn't go away.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.700]   It blew up, right?
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:10.180]   So I feel like there are a lot of non-monetary potential use cases for stuff on the blockchain,
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.180]   cryptocurrency/the blockchain.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.540]   And I'm kind of surprised that those haven't worked yet, like remittances or even just
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.540]   payments, right?
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.460]   Like we pay a lot to credit card companies to pay with a credit card.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.460]   We don't see it.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.600]   The merchant pays it.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.940]   But I would love it if somebody could make something on the blockchain that lowered fees.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.540]   People pay a lot to send money home when they go abroad to work.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.180]   It would be great if there were just some simple, boring blockchain product that people
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.720]   used who didn't care about blockchain.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.620]   Like that's what I'm waiting for and hoping for and I'm surprised that it hasn't happened
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.620]   yet.
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.720]   And do you think it will?
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.300]   I mean, do you think it will?
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   When I think about the projects that everyone I know working in this industry are excited
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:55.580]   about, it's like generative art, you know, as NFTs and, you know, there's some value
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:01.500]   to those projects, but they're not going to necessarily change the cost for someone living
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.260]   in America to send money to South America or to Europe.
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:11.180]   I feel like, you know, if you go people compared to the internet or to the web and like, you
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:15.900]   know, there was this moment in the 90s when like the internet was kind of interesting
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.380]   and weird and people didn't know what to do with it.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:24.340]   And then somebody, it was Hotmail, Hotmail came along, which was the first web-based
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.340]   email.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.380]   And like before web-based email, it was a huge hassle to get your email.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.060]   You had to have like a special app on your computer and if you were on a different computer,
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.220]   you couldn't get your email, if I recall correctly.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.060]   And so it was just this obvious killer app that was useful even if you didn't care about
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.180]   the web per se, it just let you do a thing.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.060]   And it wasn't about the technology, it was about the thing it let you do.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:51.860]   And that's all I want out of blockchain.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.860]   I want something if it's finance, sure, but just have it be financing something in the
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.860]   real world, right?
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.980]   Like DeFi just seems to be financing other DeFi, right?
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:05.260]   It's just like a Russian doll of people borrowing in crypto to buy more crypto.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.140]   Like, I believe that finance can do useful things in the world.
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.140]   I don't know.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:14.980]   Like, do you think, I mean, when you talk about whatever NFT art projects, like, truly,
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.060]   what do you think?
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.980]   I view it as one of the, like a project where I'm like, okay, the entire crypto experience,
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.060]   I'm like, I don't know what it will become.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.940]   I have, there's enough use cases that people talk about.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.760]   You mentioned remittance, title insurance.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.180]   There's all these things where I'm just waiting for a real project.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:34.020]   I think it's crazy that when you buy a house, you pay a company to-
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.020]   Title insurance.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.380]   It's like an anti-hack, right?
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.380]   Title insurance.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.220]   You just get hosed.
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.140]   And then someone else pays that insurance the next time they buy the house, and you're
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.340]   all insuring against the thing that, you know, it's crazy.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.020]   So that could be-
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.980]   Yeah, put my title in the blockchain, please.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.940]   You know, please.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.660]   But I haven't seen it, but there's so many people, some of the smartest people I've ever
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:03.100]   met are all working on different projects, and some of them in, you know, earning yield,
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:08.460]   some of them in NFTs, and some of them in crazy other stuff that's still taking shape.
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:15.340]   And so I do think there is a future of use cases that we haven't seen.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.700]   And I can't remember which podcast it was that I heard Chris Dixon from Andreessen Horowitz
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.940]   on, and he made a kind of crazy case of, you know, when the App Store came out for the
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.020]   iPhone, no one really knew what the apps were.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.220]   It was like, there were people that were like, "Oh, I want a calculator that can do some
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.580]   advanced functions," because that's what we were thinking of.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.740]   But so many things happened that were out of our wildest dreams, like we couldn't even
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.980]   come up with them.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.700]   And so I believe those things are coming.
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.460]   I'm just, I've been waiting.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.800]   Like you.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   It's been a while.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.260]   I mean, I will say, I think, when did the iPhone come out?
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.540]   I think Bitcoin is about as old as the iPhone, right?
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.760]   So you know, it's certainly taking longer than the App Store did to kind of deliver.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.020]   I mean, and whatever, easy for me to say, because I'm not doing the work.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:05.680]   But like you, I mean, you know, in a way the collapse in crypto prices might be useful
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:11.700]   because there is so much like scammy noise around crypto that like, it's just obviously
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.660]   scammy noise that you just kind of want to wave it all away.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.460]   And maybe the crash will sort of wash out the scammy noise to some extent and leave
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:25.780]   the people who are actually working in good faith on potentially useful projects.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.420]   And I think there are a lot of those people.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:32.340]   And I don't know how to pick the winners right in right now when I think of it as a to bet
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.340]   on it.
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.460]   You know, there was, there's not a way easily to bet on mobile, I guess you could buy some
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.940]   Apple stock or some Google stock.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:44.340]   It's like here, I like that the ability to bet on a fundamental piece of technology is
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.900]   a little bit more accessible.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.620]   You could probably assume that maybe, is it?
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.620]   I don't know.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.040]   I mean, you think not accessible, at least with, well, at least with the stock market,
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.540]   you have like a stream of revenues.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.220]   You have a way to value it, right?
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.540]   You can do sort of fundamental valuation, right?
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.460]   Like you could have bet on mobile 10 years ago, whereas if you're buying, I mean, you
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.460]   can buy tokens.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:09.220]   I get the logic of buying tokens, but the, but how to value them, Oh, seems very hard.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.380]   I'm not trying to convince you that it's not a speculative asset, right?
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.340]   It definitely, and most certainly is, but like, what is the right price, right?
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:22.540]   And like, what is the right, like, there's no, I don't know of any, I mean, people with
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.720]   Bitcoin are like, well, it's like gold and the, you know, the sort of total value of
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.300]   gold is much larger than the total value of Bitcoin.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.020]   But that's kind of a different thing than what we're talking about.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.180]   I think, I think it's cool that there's something happening and it's exciting and there's a
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.020]   way to put a small amount of money into it and see what happens.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.900]   It's like a trip to the casino with that's like maybe more intellectually interesting
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.380]   than going to the casino.
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:54.940]   Now that we both share a common story that in sometime almost a decade ago, for me, it
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.900]   was, I had some Bitcoin and I've, I made a purchase where I was looking online and I
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.420]   was like really into fantasy football.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.140]   I was really into fantasy football for a few years.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:08.820]   And there was this site that I'm not going to say I understood whether it was legitimate
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:14.340]   or not, but you could get access to stream all the football games of the season for the
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.820]   low price of like a Bitcoin or something.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.740]   You know, it was like maybe it was, I think you understood that this was not legitimate,
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.500]   but let's keep going.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.260]   And I remember thinking, gosh, you know, it would be way more expensive paying for NFL
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:33.540]   Sunday ticket because that's like $300 and you got to get direct TV looking back.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:40.100]   You know, it was probably like a $10,000 subscription to watch, you know, 16 or 20 games during
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.420]   a season.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:47.060]   I know you also bought a sandwich that probably, you know, maybe as a $10,000 sandwich, maybe
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.060]   more.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.060]   Yeah, more.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.460]   Me and another reporter, David Kessenbaum and I went, we bought falafel and like a smoothie.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:59.500]   And this was when Bitcoin was like, I don't know, 20, $20 for one Bitcoin, you know?
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:04.860]   And so, yeah, I mean, well, it's cheaper now than it was six months ago, right?
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.680]   Six months ago, it was a $50,000 lunch and now it's a $20,000 lunch.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.900]   So if it keeps going, maybe it'll get back to normal.
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:18.780]   I mean, that does to your earlier question about, you know, money and crypto, like money
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.820]   doesn't work that way.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:27.140]   You don't regret buying a sandwich because the value of money, you know, it actually
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.860]   appreciated so much.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.060]   Like you don't hodl money.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.260]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.940]   That's not what money is for.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:42.460]   And so, you know, on a simple level, it demonstrates the extent to which certainly Bitcoin is not
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.460]   money.
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:47.380]   And I think the closest thing to money in crypto, sort of ironically, given the history,
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.540]   is stable coins, right?
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:53.740]   Which is funny given that like so much of the sort of crypto noise is about the unreliability
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:57.300]   of the dollar, that the thing that actually functions like money is the thing that is
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.780]   pegged to the dollar.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.260]   OK, so we don't have to go too crazy on crypto.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.960]   But what do you think about institutions like Fidelity saying, oh, we're going to let people
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:12.900]   put crypto in their 401k and kind of starting to try to treat it as a mainstream investment?
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:20.300]   I mean, I guess the underlying question there is a question about sort of paternalism, really,
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.300]   right?
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.980]   Like, I mean, if some friend of mine or family member said, should I buy Bitcoin?
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.280]   I would say don't invest what you can't lose, right?
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.660]   Like if you want to make a little side bet, that's fine.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:36.740]   But like the S&P 500 is a much safer bet for the long run, is what I would say.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.420]   Whether Fidelity should let people is a weird question, right?
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.860]   Because it's like, I guess ultimately it's OK with me.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.780]   I'm not comfortable being that paternalistic.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.580]   I'm not comfortable saying to people, I know better than you and I don't think you should
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.740]   be allowed to do this.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:54.780]   But I mean, if somebody asked me for advice, I would say don't put much money in it.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.340]   So to get back to the book, at the end, you had this conclusion section of the future
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.460]   of money and you had these three possibilities.
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:08.420]   And sure, there are more, but I loved the three, which was a world without cash, a world
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.500]   without banks, and a world that sounds like the world you described in the past, which
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.660]   was the government's going to kind of manage it all and print money and give it to anyone
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.100]   who wants a job.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.180]   Is one of those a world where you actually think this is where we're going?
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:29.240]   So the world without cash is probably the most reasonable of those, right?
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.660]   It certainly feels like cash is going away.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.420]   I mean, there are a couple of things to say about that, though.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.580]   One is, in fact, cash is not going away.
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.820]   In fact, there is more cash than there has ever been, despite what it feels like.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.660]   There's an extraordinary amount of cash in the world now.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:52.680]   You know, when I wrote the book, it was something like 40, four, zero, hundred dollar bills
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:58.100]   for every man, woman, and child in America, which is just astonishing when you think about
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.160]   it, right?
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.780]   More hundred dollar bills than one dollar bills.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:06.980]   And so then there's the question of like, where is it, right?
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.860]   Where are all those hundreds?
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.060]   And the awesome answer is we don't exactly know because it's cash and kind of the whole
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:17.880]   point of cash, certainly the whole point of hundreds, let's be honest, is it's like nobody
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.880]   knows where it is.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.100]   It's not tracked.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:25.220]   You know, it's pretty clear that a lot of it is outside the United States, right?
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.860]   In a lot of countries where the banks are unreliable, where the currency is unreliable,
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:35.020]   people like U.S. paper money as a store of value, as a real store of value.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.440]   So that seems useful and it's like a good export for the U.S., right?
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.980]   People want to give us stuff and we give them paper, like that's a good deal.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.180]   So crime, right?
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.400]   Like people just use paper money to commit crimes a lot.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.300]   There was this story that came out after I wrote the book.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:53.100]   It was at the beginning of the pandemic when all the stores shut down.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:59.780]   And in L.A., in Southern California, the DEA just started seizing these vast sums of cash.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:05.040]   And what had happened was the drug dealers in L.A. were using these stores to launder
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.040]   their money.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.500]   And when the stores shut down, they couldn't launder their money anymore.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.940]   So the money was just like piling up and they just had all this cash that they couldn't
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.820]   hide anymore.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.440]   So that is still going to happen.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:25.020]   The other piece of it is money is largely already digital.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:29.300]   If cash goes away, I mean, there are certain people, like people don't have access to bank
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.300]   accounts.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:34.300]   And so you would definitely want to create a system to basically give those people bank
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.860]   accounts, give everybody a bank account, give everybody a debit card.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.360]   That's solvable.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.980]   The key thing is our money is already mostly digital, right?
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.920]   Even though I think if people sort of close their eyes and think about money, they'd think
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.020]   about a $20 bill or a $100 bill, the vast majority of money in the world is just a number
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.580]   on a bank's computer, right?
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.780]   So if cash goes away, the world wouldn't look that different.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:01.960]   I think there's a, I don't know how much, but there's a decent amount of our economy
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.040]   that happens with cash, people that get paid in cash don't pay taxes again, which maybe
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:11.540]   isn't good that that happens, but yeah, no, you're right, you're right.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:19.220]   There was this famous moment in Italy when they decided to start including in GDP and
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:24.140]   the measure of their overall economy, the black market, the illegal economy.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:30.020]   And because of the nature of the Italian economy, their GDP grew a ton when they decided to
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.020]   start counting it.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.840]   They passed, I think they passed to the UK, they became a bigger economy than the UK and
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.180]   they had like a celebration.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:42.020]   They called it il sorpasso because like, "Hey, we're bigger than the UK," which is fun.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.780]   How did they account for it?
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.780]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.780]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:52.460]   What's funny, my fun moment was I had a tenant and we had an Airbnb and we were talking about
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:56.780]   the U.S. economy, he was from Germany and we talked about cash and he was like, "Oh,
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.420]   do you want me to pay you with cash?
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.140]   Is it okay if I send it electronically?
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.140]   Do you take credit card?"
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:05.620]   We were talking about it and he's like, "Because in Germany, you know, we say that cash is
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.620]   tax neutral."
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:13.180]   And I thought that was the best description of cash I'd heard to date.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.360]   Cash neutral is funny.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:19.780]   I mean, arguably it's cash, it's tax, tax neutral is funny.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.780]   Arguably it's tax negative, right?
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.540]   Like if in the proper world, you're paying the tax and then you pay in cash, you don't
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.540]   have to pay the...
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.460]   It depends on what your baseline is.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.580]   So it's good that you've learned a lot about money.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:38.020]   You've researched it, talked about it, run a podcast for over a decade.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:42.380]   But I saw you say that before you started thinking about money, you didn't really think
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.380]   about it that seriously.
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:47.260]   It became this thing that you're now known for.
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:51.940]   And now that you have a family and kids, I'm curious what kinds of money-related lessons
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:59.100]   or thoughts you're trying to pass on so that they have a better understanding earlier on
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.100]   than maybe you did.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.100]   That's a good question.
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:09.340]   I mean, you know, the way I thought about money before I started studying it and writing
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:16.260]   about it was I was always really into saving money and not spending money.
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:23.020]   I, you know, I, yeah, just the way I was raised or my personality is like, I like a deal,
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.700]   I think twice before I buy things.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.300]   And it's interesting, you know, you ask about my kids.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:35.100]   And so a thing I think a lot about with them is what's the right balance?
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:41.780]   Like I think I was sort of neurotically cheap to some extent, or in some settings, like
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.140]   the way I thought about money, like, but at the same time, like, I'm glad that I, you
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.020]   know, know the value of a dollar, right?
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.220]   And don't take for granted buying stuff.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:57.780]   And so what I'm trying to teach or model for my kids, because the modeling is the real
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.780]   thing, right?
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.740]   With kids, what you do is really what matters.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:06.180]   So what I'm trying to model for them is some happy medium, right?
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:11.580]   Like A, recognizing that we're fortunate to just be okay and not have to worry about buying
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.580]   food and paying the rent.
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:13.900]   Like, that's a big one, right?
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.340]   Like, don't take that for granted, we're lucky.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.740]   Two, like, it's okay to buy yourself something nice.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:23.740]   But remember, like, if you buy this thing, you're going to have less money and less ability
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.060]   to buy something else in the future.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.180]   So is it worth it to you, right?
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.780]   It's that that idea, that idea of value.
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.260]   That's really what I want to teach my kids.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.540]   And how are you modeling those two things?
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.780]   Well, it's hard.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:41.020]   I mean, I'm trying to be like thoughtful about money, but not neurotic, right?
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:46.900]   Like, I'm just trying to be the, like, money person I aspire to be in my behavior in front
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:47.900]   of them.
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.900]   Do you talk about, "Oh, we're going to make this decision.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.900]   You mentioned you got to buy a house.
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:52.900]   Did you?"
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:53.900]   I don't know.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   I don't know how old your kids are.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:55.900]   So maybe that's too much.
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.580]   They're, you know, 9 and 11.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.500]   We did talk about, I mean, I explained to them the mortgage, you know, I explained to
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.500]   them how a mortgage worked.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.540]   And for that matter, we had, we lived in an apartment before and we had a mortgage.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:07.360]   And I explained to them, they're curious, smart kids, you know?
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:11.200]   And so I explained to them, like, "We're going to sell the house and we're going to get money.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.160]   And we're going to use that money to pay off the bank for this mortgage.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.160]   And then we're going to have some leftover.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.560]   And we're going to use that to buy some of the house that we're buying, and we're going
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.560]   to get a loan."
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.180]   Like, they were into the mechanics of it.
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.440]   And we talked a lot about it.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.400]   So like, that part is just fun.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.640]   Like, I'm a nerd.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.060]   My kids are kind of nerds.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:30.560]   And so the, like, the mechanics part, to me, that's like the fun, easy part.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:35.480]   The more, certainly the harder and maybe more interesting, ultimately, a part is the more
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.520]   emotional, frankly, more emotional part.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:44.600]   Because like, rationally, like, I save a lot of money and, you know, I'm fine.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.560]   We're fortunate and I work and my wife works and whatever.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:51.760]   But you know, as you know, there's a large emotional component to money.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:54:00.400]   And managing that and being reasonable about money, that I find hard at some level.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:05.040]   And I think the hardest thing, there's an unlimited number of studies that show that
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.120]   people who have money would think they will be happier if they have more money.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   Which I think is probably the hardest emotional thing to solve.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.100]   You know, whether it's keeping up with the Joneses or the hedonic treadmill or whatever
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.000]   name you want to give it.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.520]   I have not found someone give any kind of, "Here is exactly how you fix that."
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.720]   You know, the answer has been, you know, you just have to accept that what you have is
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.720]   enough.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:28.720]   And maybe it's gratitude.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.240]   Or is there anything you've picked up in all the episodes you've done or conversations
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.880]   you've had that would help someone kind of get out of that rut of kind of always thinking
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.520]   more would be better and not being content with what they have now?
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:48.540]   At a broader level, and this might be too broad, but a thing I have found in my, just
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:54.080]   in my life, frankly, more than in my work, is that I'll have some emotion about money
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.560]   or about work or something.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.560]   Some worry.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.800]   I worry a lot, whatever.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.920]   And then I'll go for a jog.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:01.920]   I like to jog.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.400]   I think that exercising just makes me less worried.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.400]   And I'll feel better.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   Right?
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.400]   I'll stop worrying about the thing I was worried about.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.160]   But the thing hasn't changed at all.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.660]   The money situation in my life or the thing at work or whatever I was worried about.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:19.160]   And so like for me, a big insight of adulthood has been my emotions are more about what's
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.680]   going on inside of me than about what's going on out in the world.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.680]   Right?
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.840]   So to me, the key thing to worry less is to not fix something external, I mean, unless
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.320]   you have some horrible thing in your life.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.880]   But I unfortunately don't have horrible things in my life.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.120]   It's to manage myself.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.120]   It's to run.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   It's to whatever.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   Sleep if you need to sleep.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.840]   Take a break if you need to take a break.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:43.640]   It's recognizing that the source of a lot of problems, a lot of worry, is internal.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.640]   Interesting.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.040]   My answer would have been something that I don't think contradicts what you said, but
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.400]   complements it on the other side, which is a lot of the source, I think, of people's
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.720]   struggles with money are thinking that most people have more than them, which I actually
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   think is not true.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:06.280]   And so my challenge to people is if you're feeling like you can't keep up with the Joneses
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.200]   per se, try to just talk about money.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:13.320]   It's like the most uncomfortable thing, and I don't know if people will, but I imagine
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:20.360]   the person on Instagram who posted a photo in a Greek island that you're jealous of,
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.480]   talk to them about money, and they might say, "Gosh, we're still struggling to pay off our
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   student loans."
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.640]   And you're like, "Oh, wow."
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.760]   They're not posting their student loans on Instagram.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.800]   They're not posting the credit card payment they missed.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:39.840]   And so your example is think inward, and mine is a complimentary one, which is talk to the
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:44.120]   people that you aspire to be like, and you might find out you're a lot more like them,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.000]   or you might even be better off.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.720]   They just might be making you look like you're not better off because all you see...
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.680]   Stay off Instagram also, right?
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.880]   Instagram is a vehicle for that.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:58.720]   I mean, you know, one word that's interesting to talk about in this context, I think it's
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.360]   under-discussed in the context of money and other things, is status, right?
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:08.840]   A lot of the time, I mean, obviously money and status are closely linked.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:15.520]   And sometimes what people will articulate as a worry about having enough or whatever
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:21.120]   is actually a worry about status, a worry about, "Oh, I am lower status than this person
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.040]   who went to Greece," or whatever, right?
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.840]   And I don't know exactly what to do about that, right?
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   In my dream world, it was like, "Don't care about status."
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.920]   But I haven't been able to not care about status, candidly, right?
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.120]   We're hierarchical animals.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.160]   It's very hard to not care about status.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:42.200]   But I think to at least be aware of it and be aware of what status games do you want
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.200]   to play?
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.320]   What status games can you get out of playing?
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:49.640]   Whether that's at work or with respect to material things or the kind of car you have
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:54.600]   or whatever, just an awareness that a lot of what we think of as like, "Oh, I need this
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.680]   or I need that, or I'm worried that I'm not going to have enough money," is really a kind
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:05.760]   of status hierarchy, primate brain doing weird things in the way we think about money.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.760]   That I also find helpful.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:10.840]   If there's a person that I could think of that might have some suggestions, and I will
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:16.400]   take it as homework to bring them on the show in the future, is Ryan Holiday, who talks
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:21.520]   a lot about stoicism, I think if I were going to try to solve that with a conversation,
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.000]   I feel like he would be the best kind of sparring partner for that.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.080]   So I will send you a note when he comes on, which if anyone listening is like, "I'm buddy,"
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.080]   send him a note.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.760]   I don't know Ryan, but I will find my way to him and encourage him.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.280]   I mean, that guy does a ton of stuff.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.560]   I bet you could get him on the show.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.760]   Before we wrap, I have a couple of things.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.200]   You said you're a nerd about money.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.440]   You love a deal.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.320]   You love saving.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.560]   In our first conversation, before we hit the record, I know you've said you've got some
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.560]   hacks for money.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:55.560]   I'd love to hear, what are the things that you do that you often find your friends or
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.360]   peers or colleagues being like, "Oh, that's great.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:02.880]   I got to start doing that," other than the I-bonds, which we'll go down as the main one
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:03.880]   for the episode?
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.160]   Oh, I mean, yeah, that's the big one.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.360]   Everything else is so small and goes more to the neurotic side.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:14.400]   It's like the stuff where I don't actually save that much money in the big picture.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.200]   I just like the feeling of getting a deal.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:19.000]   Do you know the website Auto Slash?
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.840]   This is a weird one, but there's a website called Auto Slash.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.840]   I just bought a car for the first time a couple of years ago.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.960]   I live in New York where you can get around without a car.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.240]   Before the pandemic, I didn't have a car until we would rent cars pretty often, if we're
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.920]   going to go away for the weekend or whatever.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.400]   Renting a car in New York is really expensive.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:39.440]   There's this weird website called Auto Slash where you just type in where you want to rent
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:44.200]   a car and whatever, who you are, what kind of car you want to rent.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.520]   If you're a member of Costco or the AAA or if you have this credit card or that credit
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.520]   card.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:54.520]   Then the weird thing about it is it's not instant, but like, I don't know, an hour later
[00:59:54.520 --> 01:00:01.700]   they email you rental car deals and they tend to be really good deals.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:07.000]   In New York, it's like the difference between 100 or 150 bucks a day and like 25 bucks a
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.800]   day for a rental car sometimes.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.800]   It's like a big deal.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   That one, I don't know.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.800]   Is that too little?
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.600]   Is that the wrong size hack?
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.400]   I think I would say no, because the CEO of Auto Slash, Jonathan Weinberg, is actually
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.400]   we're recording episode next week all about rental cars.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.400]   Okay.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.400]   Well, you're welcome, Jonathan.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.880]   You just teed that up perfectly.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   But yeah, I think rental cars, especially right now, there's no supply of cars in the
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.880]   market.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:36.080]   I noticed when we ordered our Tesla, they said it's going to come in April.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.720]   We had our second child in June, car hadn't come.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.040]   Car said in the app, it's coming in July.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.560]   We were like, we can manage for a month in a car that doesn't fit everyone.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560]   That's okay.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.680]   And then it said, okay, it's got pushed back.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.160]   It's no longer July.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.140]   It's going to be somewhere between December and next April.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.840]   And we were like, so I called Tesla, I was like, what is going on?
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.120]   And they're like, ah, you know, it's normal that the dates shift like that.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120]   I was like, what do you mean?
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120]   What do you mean?
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.920]   It's normal that the dates shift by six months?
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.000]   It's normal that you go buy a car and drive home.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.760]   That's what's normal, Tesla.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.400]   And then a week later it shifted back and it said, ah, this is the thing that I thought
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.400]   was so crazy.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.920]   It said August 11th to October 12th.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.880]   And I was like, okay, I guess it's normal that it shifts by six months.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.520]   And then the next week it said August 12th to October 13th.
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:32.000]   And I was like, how could a company have enough precision to change my delivery estimate by
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.120]   a day when two weeks prior it was six.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.120]   But the window is still two months, right?
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.720]   We know it won't be August 12th anymore.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.320]   It's still a big window, but we're shifting it by 2%.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.680]   Yeah, well, the hack for this, though, that I learned, which I didn't want to share until
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.720]   I got the car right now, I don't care is that when Tesla has a car that is ready for pickup,
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.200]   they email someone say, hey, your car's here.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.960]   And if in three days you're not ready for it, they put it to someone else.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.600]   And so can you like fly standby with Tesla?
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.860]   Can you get on the I want to be on the someone else list?
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:10.380]   So I wouldn't say it's like accepted, but it's also maybe not like prevented.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.620]   This is this is the hack.
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.300]   This is the perfect hack window.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.300]   Yes.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.120]   So if you go not to the showroom, but the delivery center.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.960]   So in every major area, there's a delivery center in the Bay Area.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.680]   It's in Colma.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.240]   And you know, I would say for a cemetery, yeah, I know.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.640]   I would say, you know, it, it helps if you genuinely have a need.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:34.040]   We went in, we're like, our family doesn't fit in the car we have today.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.480]   But we would like it.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.060]   People are willing to make an exception.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:42.040]   If you're flexible, you're like, we will change the color.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.720]   That's fine.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.720]   We found someone and they said, look, if a car shows up and no one wants it after two
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.640]   and a half days, you know, or if we get a verbal confirmation that they don't want it,
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.760]   we'll give you a call because they want to get the car off the lot.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.640]   And if they if they know someone that's going to come right away, it's helpful.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.720]   I think they're supposed to put it back in the queue and give it to the next person in
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.720]   line.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.760]   But, you know, every now and what we ended up getting was a car that came in six months
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.840]   ago and had something wrong with the door.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.320]   And because they prioritize people who own cars, they prioritize fixing their cars.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.200]   This car just sat there for, you know, four or five months before they fix the door.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.280]   And now it's technically a twenty twenty one and the new cars are twenty twenty twos.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.160]   So they kept calling people and saying, hey, you're twenty twenty twos here.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.080]   It's actually last year's model.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.080]   Nothing changed.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:35.080]   They changed like the charge port is slightly different and that's it.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:39.240]   And for anyone listening who's a huge nerd, they also added this like swiveling screen
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.440]   that's motorized, but it didn't matter to us.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.560]   So they're like, gosh, here's a person that said I will take it.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.800]   Let's stop calling people that keep saying no and give it to that person.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.720]   You just so you just got it now.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.240]   You got it in June instead of August to October and your whole family fits in it.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.240]   We got it yesterday.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:00.000]   I spent yesterday afternoon like putting two car seats in there and getting it all ready.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.400]   But yeah, it's a one day old car with a one point nine nine percent loan that I'm excited
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.400]   about.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.400]   That's a good hack.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.400]   What else you got?
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:16.800]   I hit really hard the filters on like kayak, like really hard kayak trip advisor, you know,
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   in the like left rail on kayak.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.080]   You can do all kinds of dialing, right?
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:26.200]   Like so I live in New York, for example, and there's multiple airports, which is helpful.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:31.560]   But you know, you can turn on and off like I'm big at just like pricing different things,
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.560]   right?
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.680]   Like there is some price for which I'd be willing to fly on Spirit Airlines, but it's
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.120]   typically not the price, you know, some price differential.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.700]   There's some amount of price differential that makes it worth it depends on am I flying
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.560]   with my kids and it's going to be a lot, lot more right.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.800]   On the other hand, the thing about flying with kids, as you know, is like everything
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.760]   is suddenly 4X.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.760]   Here's one.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   Okay.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   Here's a hack.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   I don't know if it's a hack.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   I find it useful as a hack.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.920]   If there's some recurring thing you pay for, whether it's, you know, a monthly bill is
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.080]   easy, but even like a thing you buy at the grocery store every week, annualize it, right?
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:10.720]   So if there's something, if you're spending an extra 10 bucks a week at the grocery store
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:15.520]   on something, something's 10 bucks more than the other thing, that's actually 500 bucks
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.080]   a year, right?
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.360]   And I find saying, is this worth an extra 500 bucks a year to me feels different than
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.760]   is this worth an extra 10 bucks to me every time.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.400]   So like that's a sort of behavioral hack, right?
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.600]   It's a way of framing things that helps me spend less, frankly.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.240]   And same with subscriptions, obviously subscriptions are killer that way.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.040]   I haven't signed up for, do you use, you know, there are those products now, there are a
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.480]   subscription product to manage your subscription products.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.200]   And I've, I've been interested in those because I have so many now, like for software, like
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:51.120]   I have, you know, Microsoft and Adobe and Dropbox and all these ones that like, I don't
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.480]   use that much.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:59.920]   And they are, you know, altogether, certainly hundreds, maybe $1,000 a year, right?
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.600]   I could use a hack on that one, I think.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   Can you help me?
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:07.920]   So Truebill is a sponsor of the show, and as people know, no, no, no, that I didn't
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.920]   ask you to.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   You're welcome.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:10.920]   You're welcome.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.920]   Truebill.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.200]   I, I vet all the products that services anyone that wants to sponsor the show.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.880]   I'm like, I am very serious.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.520]   I'm like, I'm going to use the product.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.520]   I'm going to try the product.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.120]   My wife will try the product.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.200]   And I say no to most of them.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.200]   So I downloaded Truebill.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.960]   I'd never used it before.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:30.120]   And you know, I get, they're getting a free ad here that it's not part of the ad, but
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.020]   basically what you can do is you can see a calendar of when all your subscriptions are,
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:38.120]   where they are, even just the free version of, of not hiring them to do anything.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.540]   And it's just, what are they all?
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.540]   And that's free.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:44.100]   Because there's so many, there's so many, and they recur.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:48.880]   And like, I mean, there's the simple things of like right when you sign up, you know,
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.600]   make sure it's not automatically recurring.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.800]   Like that's a useful one.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.560]   There's so many, like very often I'll get an email that's like, Hey, thanks for renewing
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.120]   your subscription for another year.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.720]   We just billed you 90 bucks.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.840]   I'm like, ah, um, one, a great one.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.720]   I'll give you two, two ones for this.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:11.680]   So one is if you have a capital one card, they have this browser extension called Eno.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.440]   And I dislike the fact that they have hijacked a keyboard shortcut that I used for something
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.440]   else.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.860]   But other than that, what they do is they give you a virtual card for everything.
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:26.680]   So you install this browser extension and a lot of the virtual card companies like privacy
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.960]   is an example.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.900]   They route your money through your bank account.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.120]   You don't earn points.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   I don't love it.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   I like the points.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.400]   But, but the advantage is it doesn't automatically renew, right?
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400]   It's sort of self-destruct.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.520]   So they can't bill you again.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.520]   That's the advantage of it.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.520]   Right.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.880]   So because this one's tied to capital one, the card issuer, you still earn all your rewards,
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:52.920]   but you can say that this card, yeah, for this card, I want to only allow a purchase
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.520]   of a hundred dollars and then, or I want to go manually turn it off.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.320]   So I want to buy a subscription.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.320]   It's a one-year thing.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.440]   They don't have the ability to cancel it.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.840]   Maybe you have to call to cancel.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:07.140]   I just buy it and immediately turn off the billing for that card.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.680]   And the great thing is it's just not going to go through.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.840]   They're going to say, Hey, we had to cancel your subscription.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.200]   Now True Bill does have a feature where you could say, Hey, just call them for me and
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   cancel it.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.560]   And like that, that is a part of their, their premium subscription.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.940]   They'll just do all that for you.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:24.480]   But I like to use capital one's thing because you still get the points, but they will go
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.360]   in and cancel, cancel the thing.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.920]   And it just happens that I use my capital one card for a lot of internet stuff.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:35.960]   Cause it's the like two X on everything, not the, you know, travel bonuses and grocery
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.320]   bonus.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.340]   You got any travel hacks for me?
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:44.520]   And here's the thing for me with travel hacks is like, again, because I have kids, like
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.320]   I'm definitely in the like schmuck category now where I have to go at the time when everybody
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.680]   goes, I have to fly the weekend.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.080]   You don't want to have to fly.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.080]   Right.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.040]   So I'm starting in a bad place, right?
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.440]   I'm starting where I'm the guy who has to pay retail for the seat.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.640]   And I don't want to be that guy.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.160]   What can you do for me?
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.400]   I mean, going back and listening to a handful of episodes is probably not the best answer
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.400]   for you.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.500]   Like I'll probably cut that.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.500]   Maybe I won't.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.500]   Maybe I won't.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.820]   The best answer is you should have been listening to the podcast.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:16.220]   We've got a handful of episodes that tackle this.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.540]   The hard answer is.
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:22.820]   I sometimes think that if you have the points, things open up last minute.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:28.300]   So it's like the scary option, which is if you can find something, you know, I'll sometimes
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:34.140]   buy the Southwest flight that I can cancel last minute, pay for a refundable fare, and
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:37.600]   then keep looking for the for the last minute deal.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   And most of the airlines now are refundable.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.360]   So or not refundable, sorry, cancelable, and you get a full credit, but you don't have
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.680]   to pay a fee.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.880]   So if you book with an airline where, you know, I fly Delta all the time.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.680]   If I have to cancel this and get a 500 dollar Delta credit, it's going to be OK.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   Buy the ticket.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.680]   This is something I'd like to buy the ticket and then make the barrier having to cancel
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.060]   to when you get a better deal instead of holding off and making the action.
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.640]   I have to go buy it.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:11.820]   And so I say buy it and then check in regularly as late as the day of or the night before.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:17.760]   A lot of times within the last week, tickets are really, really inexpensive with points.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.800]   My wife's family wants to come visit because we had the new baby and they're coming next
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.240]   week, like within five days.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:31.240]   And we looked on United and they live in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, which is notoriously an
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.100]   expensive place to fly to because it's just United and Southwest.
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:39.400]   And they route through Denver and they have a monopoly over the airports.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.440]   And it was so cheap for points.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.920]   It was like the lowest inventory, 12000 points each way or 12.5 for a ticket that was like
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.040]   six or seven hundred dollars.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.600]   So it ended up being a fantastic deal because they booked within a week.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.720]   What they could have done is bought a Southwest ticket a month ago, canceled it if they needed
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.720]   to.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.720]   Yeah, sure.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.040]   I also want to talk about the podcast.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.600]   I mentioned it in the intro, but you started a new podcast after being in this space longer
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.000]   than most.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.640]   What led you to this topic?
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.120]   So I started this show called What's Your Problem?
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.280]   And it's really a show about people solving technical problems in the real world.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.280]   Right.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.000]   I talked to, you know, engineers and founders of, you know, companies that are doing things
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.960]   that seem interesting and important to me.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:32.440]   You know, drone delivery, self-driving cars, but also events markets.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.840]   I just interviewed somebody who started the first company that was approved by the CFTC
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.840]   to let people bet on real world events.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.240]   That's an interesting one.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.720]   And you know, what led me to start it was, I mean, it just seemed fun to start something,
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.720]   frankly.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.720]   Right.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.640]   But I think that sort of the big idea that I got excited about when I started learning
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.280]   about economics, which didn't happen until relatively late in my life, was this idea
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:02.840]   that the pie can get bigger, that everybody can be better off, that the world is not fundamentally
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.840]   a zero-sum game.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.840]   Right.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.160]   I feel like that is actually the big insight of economics.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.600]   And I didn't know it before.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.880]   And I think it's not intuitive, right?
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.640]   Like I think the intuitive idea of the world is it's zero-sum.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.040]   If somebody's getting more, somebody else must be getting less.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.040]   But that's not true.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.040]   Right.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.080]   Like the good news of economics is everybody can get richer.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.280]   Everybody can have more.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:33.600]   And the way that happens is technological improvements, basically.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.520]   People figure out how to get more stuff out of a day's work.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520]   Right.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.600]   People figure out new efficiencies, ways to do new useful things.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.160]   And so the show, the big idea of the show is like, let's talk to the people who are
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.600]   actually figuring that stuff out.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.320]   I think next week is going to be DNA storage, right?
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:58.960]   People are figuring out how to store data in DNA, which is just like rad.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.360]   And apparently you can fit the whole internet in a shoebox.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.760]   But of course, it's super expensive now.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.920]   And there's like all these hard problems.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.920]   How do you make it cheaper?
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.920]   How do you make it actually work?
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.680]   So that's the idea of the show.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.040]   One thing I always ask everyone, because a lot of our listeners love to travel, is pick
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.440]   a place you're pretty familiar with.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.840]   Someone's in town there.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.600]   Where should they go for a great meal?
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.120]   Maybe a drink and some unusual thing to do to spend an afternoon.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:29.920]   I mean, I live in New York and you know, my hack for New York is like, just walk around.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.080]   I don't know if that's too obvious to be a hack, but like, I love New York.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.760]   I love living here.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.040]   I don't, even before the pandemic, I never really went to the theater.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.480]   Didn't go to, didn't go to anything.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.920]   I just like being in New York.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.200]   I just like walking around.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.360]   Just get on the subway, walk around downtown and just, just enjoy.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.360]   It's free.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   Eat anywhere.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.360]   It doesn't matter.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   Eat at a cart, you know, just be in the street.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360]   So that's one.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.480]   I don't know if that's weak or not.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:01.460]   The other one that came to mind, I grew up in San Diego and my favorite place to eat
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:06.480]   in San Diego is a taco shop called Roberto's, which is just like super low key, cheap taco
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480]   shop.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.940]   It's actually, there's several of them.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:16.420]   My favorite one is in Delmar and it's just a little taco shop near the beach, near Torrey
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.460]   Pines is the name of the beach.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.080]   But just go there and get whatever.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.620]   You can get a, get whatever you want.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:26.020]   Get a carne asada burrito if you want to get one, sort of mild classic, but get whatever
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.020]   you want.
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.780]   You sit out on the deck and you have a view of the ocean.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:33.380]   It costs, you know, it's cheap, it's delicious.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.380]   The beach is right there.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.380]   You can go jump in the ocean.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.300]   It's an incredible state park, Torrey Pines state park with these beautiful bluffs out
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.940]   over the ocean.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.940]   You can hike there.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.940]   Maybe you'll see a dolphin.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.020]   You see the ocean.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.820]   It's amazing.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.420]   That's exactly the kind of recommendation people love.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.420]   Thank you.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.780]   Roberto's Torrey Pines, Delmar.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.780]   I love the show.
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.980]   Thanks for doing it.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.580]   People should definitely check it out.
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.100]   Any other places people should find you online before we wrap?
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.740]   I spend too much time on Twitter.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.740]   I'm @JacobGoldstein.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.560]   If you ask me a question there, I'll see it and answer it.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.560]   It's nice.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.560]   Awesome.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.840]   Jacob, thank you so much for being here.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.840]   It was a delight.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840]   Thanks for having me.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   You're welcome.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   Thanks for having me.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.840]   Bye.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:13.840]   Bye.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.840]   Bye.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.840]   Bye.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.840]   Bye.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:38.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
