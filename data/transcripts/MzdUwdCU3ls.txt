[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.180]   - Pastor John is on a writing leave right now,
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.420]   writing his next book, and we will have more on that
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.100]   in the near future, but for the next several episodes,
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.340]   we're joined by our good friend Ray Ortland.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.740]   Ray is an author and the senior pastor
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.860]   of Emanuel Church in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.500]   And today I wanna talk about marriage
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.020]   because Ray, I've been following you on Twitter
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.500]   and Instagram for a few years now,
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.980]   and one of the things that strikes me
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.060]   is the beautiful and happy marriage you enjoy
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.260]   with your wife, Jannie.
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.820]   It's really sweet to watch.
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.740]   And so I wanna start here, speaking especially to guys,
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.740]   what is the secret to a long and sweet and happy marriage?
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.000]   (laughs)
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.260]   - Well, I think of immediately of Proverbs 5, verse 18,
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.900]   rejoice in the wife of your youth.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.660]   I'm struck by that because it doesn't say
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.820]   rejoice in your young wife.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.820]   That's biblical too.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.860]   Deuteronomy 24 says, "When a man is newly married,
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.060]   "he shall not go out with the army.
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.900]   "He shall be free at home for one year
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.140]   "to be happy with his wife."
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.940]   And that sounds like a really wonderful year.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.500]   Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.900]   That lasts throughout a lifetime, even into old age.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.820]   The wife of my youth, Tony, she will always be,
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.620]   however long we live, she will always be that girl
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.540]   I fell in love with starting September 12th, 1968,
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.500]   just outside the South entrance to Centennial Gym
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.100]   on the campus of Wheaton College.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.420]   And in the intervening years, now 43 years,
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.340]   which have flown by, nothing important has changed.
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.780]   She is still that girl who gave herself to me
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.660]   on our wedding day.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.100]   She literally put herself in my arms.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.260]   She could not have been more trusting.
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.420]   She could not have honored me any more than she did.
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.380]   And Proverbs 5:18 is calling me to remember that
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.300]   and dwell on that, the privilege of falling in love with her,
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.540]   being entrusted by God with this precious girl,
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.540]   dwelling on that, marveling at that, rejoicing in that.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.060]   So I would say in answer to your question, Tony,
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.980]   any married man who's listening, I would ask,
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.380]   what made you fall in love with your wife at the start?
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.740]   Something really wonderful happened there.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.900]   Falling in love is one of the great privileges
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.980]   of human existence.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.860]   It is truly of God.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.500]   Go back to that.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.340]   And of course, much has happened through the years,
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460]   but if you still have that girl,
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.740]   she counts for more than all the troubles of this life.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.740]   And the years take a toll, of course,
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.100]   but she will always be that girl
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.180]   that you fell in love with.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.180]   So marvel at what God gave you
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.980]   and think of how God has blessed you through her
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.180]   and let your heart melt all over again.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.900]   God is inviting us, I think, through Proverbs 5:18,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.980]   he's inviting every married man into a lifetime
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.580]   of careful, thoughtful, intentional rejoicing
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.540]   as long as we both shall live.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.660]   - Wonderful, thank you for that reminder, Ray.
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.500]   That's Ray Ortlund, the author of several books,
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.460]   including two of my favorites,
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.420]   his Commentary on Proverbs, which is just outstanding.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.180]   It's one of my top 10 books of the year back in 2012
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.420]   and I really enjoyed reading his latest title,
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.140]   The Gospel, How the Church Portrays the Beauty of Christ,
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.340]   which was in my list of best books in 2014.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.220]   And we'll talk about the role of the local church later on.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.980]   I have several more questions for Ray coming up.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:49.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
