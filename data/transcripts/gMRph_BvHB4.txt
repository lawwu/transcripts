[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.900]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.760]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   Today, we are going to talk about the psychology
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.080]   and the biology of desire, love, and attachment.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.600]   Today happens to be Valentine's Day, 2022.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.000]   However, the themes we are going to discuss
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.560]   pertain to desire, love, and attachment
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.760]   on any given day.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.240]   And indeed, the mechanisms we are going to discuss
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.080]   almost certainly were at play thousands of years ago,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.480]   hundreds of years ago,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.160]   and no doubt will still be at play in our minds
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.380]   and in our bodies and in our psychologies
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.700]   for the decades, centuries, and thousands of years to come.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.000]   Indeed, today I want to focus on core mechanisms
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.280]   that lead individuals to seek out other individuals
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.560]   with whom to mate with,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.120]   with whom to have children with or not,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.640]   with whom to enter short or long-term relationships with,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.200]   and perhaps to end those relationships
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.920]   or to seek relationships on the side,
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.480]   so-called infidelity.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.360]   I'm certainly not going to encourage or discourage
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.320]   any of these behaviors.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.700]   I'm simply going to cover the peer-reviewed scientific data
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.840]   on all these aspects of desire, love, and attachment.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.260]   I'm going to discuss how our childhood attachment styles,
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.760]   as they're called, influence our adult attachment styles.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.960]   Yes, you heard that right.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.640]   How we attached or did not attach to primary caregivers
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.280]   in our childhood has much to do with how we attach
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.060]   or fail to attach to romantic partners as adults,
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.920]   because the same neural circuits,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.400]   the neurons and their connections in the brain and body
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.720]   that underlie attachment between infant and caregiver,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.360]   between toddler and parent or other caregiver,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.180]   and during adolescence and in our teenage years
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.060]   are repurposed for adult romantic attachments.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.240]   I know that might be a little eerie to think about,
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.980]   but indeed that is true.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.020]   Now, the fortunate thing is that regardless
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.900]   of our childhood attachment styles and experiences,
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.260]   the neural circuits for desire, love, and attachment
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.320]   are quite plastic.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.860]   They are amenable to change in response
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.860]   to both what we think and what we feel,
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.560]   as well as what we do.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.040]   However, all three aspects that we're discussing today,
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.060]   desire, love, and attachment,
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.000]   are also strongly biologically driven.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.520]   We're going to talk about biological mechanisms
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.120]   such as hormones, biological mechanisms
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.320]   such as neurochemicals, things like dopamine,
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.820]   oxytocin, and serotonin, and neural circuits, brain areas,
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.960]   and indeed areas of the body that interact with the brain
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.140]   that control whether or not we desire somebody or not,
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.360]   whether or not we lose or increase our desire
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.960]   for somebody over time, whether or not we fall in love,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   what love means, and whether or not the relationships
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.280]   we form continue to include the elements of desire
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.680]   and love over time or not.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.120]   In order to illustrate just how powerfully our biology
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.060]   can shape our perception of the attractiveness
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.440]   of other people, I want to share with you the results
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.880]   of a couple of studies.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.200]   Both studies explore how people rate
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.160]   other people's attractiveness.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.240]   And in both studies, the major variable is that women
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.840]   are at different stages of their menstrual cycle.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.440]   Now, in the first study, men are rating the attractiveness
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.360]   of women according to the smell of those women.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.760]   Now, they're not smelling them directly.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.240]   They're smelling clothing that women wore
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.640]   for a couple of days at different phases
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.880]   of their menstrual cycle.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.280]   And what they find is that men will rate the odors of women
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.760]   as most attractive if those women wore those shirts,
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.520]   that clothing, in the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.040]   Okay, so this is not to say that men do not find women
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.080]   attractive at other stages of their cycle.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.440]   It is to say that men find women's odors
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.520]   particularly attractive if those odors were worn by women
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.680]   that are in the pre-ovulatory phase
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.160]   of their menstrual cycle, okay?
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.840]   Now, there was also a study that was done
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.680]   where women at different stages of their menstrual cycle
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.920]   are rating the odors of men.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.380]   And a similar but mirror symmetric result was found
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.260]   such that women who are in the pre-ovulatory phase
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.480]   of their menstrual cycle will rate men's odors
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.400]   as more attractive than at other stages of their cycle.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.760]   So the simple way to put this is that there seems
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.660]   to be something special about the pre-ovulatory phase
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.480]   of a woman's menstrual cycle that makes men rate them
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.220]   as more attractive during that time and women rate men
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.460]   as more attractive during that particular time as well.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.360]   So this is a bi-directional effect.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.620]   The way that the second study was done
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.440]   where women are rating men was not just to smell the odors
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.160]   of those men on t-shirts, they did that,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.760]   but they correlated that with whether or not the shirts
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.800]   were worn by men that were particularly
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.600]   physically symmetrical.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.640]   They actually had these men divided into groups.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.240]   It was more of a continuum rather,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.520]   rated according to body symmetry and face symmetry.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.040]   And women preferred more symmetrical men
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.760]   when they were doing the preference test
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.400]   during the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.380]   So again, the point is that that pre-ovulatory phase
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.540]   of the cycle seems to create a bi-directional
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.380]   mutual attractiveness.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.980]   Now also extremely interesting is that this effect
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.200]   does really seem to have something to do with ovulation,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.020]   because in both studies, they had women
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.340]   that were taking oral contraception or not.
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.640]   And what they found was if a woman
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.900]   is taking oral contraception, it prevented that peak
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.640]   in perceived attractiveness by the men,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.160]   meaning men no longer perceived a woman to be more attractive
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.280]   at a particular phase of their cycle.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.360]   And also women taking oral contraception
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.700]   no longer preferred the odors of more symmetrical men
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.160]   during the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.120]   I want to make sure that it's especially clear
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.320]   that it is not the case that oral contraception
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.480]   reduced the perception of a woman as attractive.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.280]   That did not happen in these studies.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.500]   It reduced the further increase in a male's perception
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.540]   of her as attractive.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.160]   And if women took oral contraception,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.040]   it prevented them from preferring more symmetrical men
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.100]   based on the odors of those men.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.640]   Now I realize there are a lot of variables here.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.100]   We've got odors, we've got symmetry,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.200]   we've got menstrual cycle, pre-ovulatory, non-pre-ovulatory,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   and we have whether or not people
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.680]   are taking contraception or not.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.640]   But the basic finding is that depending on where women are
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.180]   in their menstrual cycle influences
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.220]   both men's perception of them as attractive
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.400]   and their perception of men as attractive
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.360]   and oral contraception eliminates that effect.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.680]   So I share with you those data to illustrate
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.640]   that we often think that somebody is attractive or not
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.340]   based on, I don't know how they look,
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.500]   their skin, their hair, et cetera.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.360]   But it also illustrates that their odor is a powerful cue
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.760]   for some people more than others.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.000]   Some of us tend to be more olfactory driven than others.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.720]   Although if you watched the Huberman Lab podcast episode
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   that I did with Professor David Buss
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.520]   from the University of Texas, Austin,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.340]   who's a luminary in the field of evolutionary psychology
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.980]   and has studied mate choice
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.400]   and mate selection bias over decades,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.820]   he's really one of the founders of that field.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.180]   He emphasized findings that odor for many people
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.240]   is a maker or a deal breaker.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.260]   Meaning there are some people that even if somebody
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.700]   has all the characteristics that they're looking for
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.520]   in terms of kindness and attractiveness and values
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.100]   and other features that would and should be
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.440]   of very high priority in selecting a mate,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.280]   that if someone does not like the way that person smells,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.000]   their innate body odor,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.460]   independent of colognes and perfumes and soaps, et cetera,
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.480]   that that's often a complete and total deal breaker.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.200]   I'm sure there are some of you that can relate to that
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.360]   and there are some of you
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.440]   perhaps for which that is not the case.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.520]   And you can't even imagine
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.420]   that being such a powerful variable.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.280]   And yet the data suggests that indeed
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.840]   it is a powerful variable for many people out there.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.680]   Before we begin,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.800]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.100]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.380]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.120]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.760]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.840]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.540]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.480]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.800]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.960]   Now nootropics is not a word that I'm usually a fan of
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.380]   because nootropic means smart drug.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.900]   And there are a lot of different aspects
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.000]   to being smart or to intelligence.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.420]   There's the ability to focus.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.460]   There's the ability to task switch.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.660]   There's the ability to be creative.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.940]   And each of those different forms of intelligence
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.460]   or expressions of intelligence
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.180]   involves different brain circuits, different neurochemicals,
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.320]   and indeed different hormones in the body.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.200]   So I think it's rather naive to think
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.800]   that there could be one smart drug or nootropic.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.240]   Thesis understands this.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.480]   And so they've developed custom nootropics
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.440]   that are tailored to the specific goals
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.380]   that you might have in terms of cognitive work
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.020]   or physical exercise or skill learning of any kind.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.440]   And they tailor them to the individual.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.820]   They only use the highest quality ingredients,
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.000]   many of which I've talked about here on the podcast,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.260]   things like alpha GPC, which I personally use,
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.080]   things like phosphatidylserine,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.960]   which I also use on occasion.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.120]   However, they've taken different combinations
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.440]   of those ingredients and put them into different formulations
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.320]   designed for particular goals or endpoints.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.640]   For instance, I have thesis nootropics
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.440]   that are for motivation,
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.140]   others that are for clarity, for mental clarity,
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.020]   others that I take pre-workout,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.360]   others that I take post-workout, and so on and so forth.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.020]   Now, in addition to that, thesis understands
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.160]   that not every ingredient is terrific for everybody.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.080]   In fact, one particular substance
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.020]   that I've talked about on the podcast, ginkgo biloba,
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.120]   is very useful for a lot of people.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.560]   However, I don't tolerate it well.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.660]   I get vicious headaches from ginkgo biloba.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.900]   So none of the formulations that they've made for me
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.560]   include ginkgo biloba.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.460]   So again, these are custom nootropics
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.520]   that are tailored for your particular goals
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   and where the ingredients really match
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.120]   your particular needs and don't include things
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.400]   that aren't going to work for you
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.620]   or that create things like headaches.
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.980]   So the personalization and the targeted effects
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.240]   of the nootropics is really where the power comes from.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.060]   I've been using thesis nootropics
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.440]   for close to six months now,
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.780]   and I can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.760]   have been a total game changer for me.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.120]   My go-to formula is the motivation formula,
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.960]   if I'm going to be training or working out
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.060]   or I need extra energy,
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.220]   and I use the clarity formula nowadays
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.320]   for any kind of writing or creative work.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.840]   Those are the two that I've mainly been taking lately.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.680]   If you want to try
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.080]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.640]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.880]   You'll take a three-minute quiz
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.020]   and thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.520]   to try in your first month.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.760]   You'll have the ability to try those different blends
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.780]   across that month,
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.260]   discover which nootropics work best for you,
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.340]   your unique brain chemistry and genetics.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.140]   You can have a consult with them
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.100]   and then they will give you the best nootropics for you.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.580]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.500]   and use the code Huberman at checkout

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.460]   now called AG1.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.860]   I've been taking AG1 since 2012,
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.140]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.840]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.660]   and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.060]   is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral probiotic needs.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.660]   Probiotics are essential
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.580]   because they support what's called a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.440]   The gut microbiome is vital
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.500]   for things like metabolism, hormone function,
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.940]   and also we now know our brain function,
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.020]   things like focus and memory and our general immune system.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.140]   With AG1, I get the probiotics I need,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.340]   I get the vitamins and minerals
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.940]   that I need to cover any nutritional gaps
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.180]   if I'm not eating optimally,
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.140]   and even if I am eating optimally,
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.540]   AG1 can further support metabolism,
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.660]   hormone function, et cetera.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.540]   In fact, whenever people ask me,
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.480]   what's the one supplement that I should take?
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.580]   If I can only take one supplement, I always say AG1.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.260]   I take mine early in the day,
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.380]   I mix it with water and some lemon or lime juice,
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.220]   I love the way it tastes,
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.860]   and I'll take it again later in the day,
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.820]   typically in the late afternoon.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.260]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.860]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.460]   and claim a special offer.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.280]   They're giving you five free travel packs
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.140]   that make it really easy to mix up AG1
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.760]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.860]   and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.420]   There's a ton of data now
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.300]   supporting the fact that vitamin D3 is critical
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.600]   and that most of us don't get enough vitamin D3,
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.640]   even if we're getting ample sunlight.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.460]   Vitamin D3 is important for metabolism,
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.780]   hormone function, brain function,
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.160]   and many other aspects of our biology.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.260]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.380]   you can get a special offer of the Athletic Greens,
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.440]   five free travel packs,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.320]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.620]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.340]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.180]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.740]   to help you better understand your body
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.900]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.800]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.200]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.540]   that influence your immediate and long-term health
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.620]   can only be discovered from a quality blood test.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.520]   And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.420]   you can also get information, for instance,
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.280]   about how your biological age
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.980]   compares to your chronological age,
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.760]   which of course is a vital measurement.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.060]   Now, one of the major issues with blood tests
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.340]   and DNA tests out there
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.360]   is that people get the information back
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.700]   that lipid marker of one type, it might be high or low,
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.460]   or that a hormone of another type might be high or low,
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.880]   but they don't give you any information
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.680]   about what to do with that information.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.720]   Inside Tracker makes that all very easy to navigate.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.260]   Once you get your results back,
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260]   you can click on any of those results,
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.780]   and Inside Tracker will immediately show you
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.060]   things that you can do, for instance,
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.420]   with your nutrition or supplementation or lifestyle factors
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.500]   to help you bring those numbers into the ranges
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.340]   that are appropriate for you.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.600]   So it's immensely powerful,
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.140]   not just in terms of the measurements,
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.240]   but also it provides some directives
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.620]   that can help bring those measurements into the ranges
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.180]   that are best for your immediate and long-term health.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.620]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.180]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.900]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.180]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.180]   Let's talk about desire, love, and attachment.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.380]   And of course, these are topics
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.740]   that grab tremendous interest,
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.740]   so it's worth us defining our terms a little bit
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.820]   before going any further.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.900]   Of course, we can have many different kinds of loves.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.300]   There's romantic love.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.200]   There's love of family, so-called familial love.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.580]   There's love of pets.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.240]   We can even love objects,
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.260]   where we can feel as if we love objects.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.660]   We can love certain activities.
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.220]   We can have friends that we love, and so on and so forth.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.780]   The word love is used to encompass
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.420]   a lot of different types of relationships.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.860]   Today, we are mainly going to be focused on romantic love
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.160]   and the neural mechanisms of romantic love.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.740]   I want to acknowledge here at the outset
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.080]   that most of the studies of romantic love
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.820]   have focused on monogamous heterosexual love.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.260]   And also, when we talk about studies focused on desire
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260]   and attractiveness and attachment, that's also the case.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.220]   And that simply reflects the general bias of the literature
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.620]   over the last 50 to 100 years.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.180]   It does, of course, not rule out that similar
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.400]   or different mechanisms could be at play
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.540]   in non-monogamous relationships,
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.560]   in homosexual relationships,
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.900]   or in relationships of any kind or variation.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.380]   It's also worth us defining our terms around desire.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.100]   It can mean lust.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.900]   It can mean the desire for long-term partnership.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.220]   So we need to define our terms.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.920]   And throughout, I will do my best
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.300]   to very carefully define what I mean by desire,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.660]   what I mean by love, and what I mean by attachment.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.320]   The formal study of love and desire and attachment
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.860]   goes back to the early 1900s.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.860]   One of the classic studies on this
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.620]   is entitled "Love and Desire."
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.520]   It was published in 1912 and really focused
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.060]   on two opposing themes within romance.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.420]   One is love, which in that paper was really meant
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.100]   to include attachment and dependence
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.620]   or interdependence between individuals, right?
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.340]   And the other end of the spectrum being desire
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.180]   or the sexual desire for another.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.540]   And romance was meant to encapsulate both those things,
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.260]   love and desire.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.300]   And for much of the 1900s,
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.980]   it was thought that love and desire
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.260]   were on sort of opposing ends or in kind of a push-pull.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.340]   And it was the dynamic push and pull
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.340]   between love and desire that one could define romance.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.340]   And that actually led to much of what's out there
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.180]   in the psychological literature.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.060]   Today, we are going to explore some neurobiological studies,
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.240]   some studies of the endocrine system,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.440]   meaning the hormone system,
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.320]   that actually support that general model.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.220]   And I'll point you toward what I think is a very useful book
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.460]   in thinking about how relationships can both form and last
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.620]   over long periods of time
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.800]   and how those relationships can include
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.900]   both desire and interdependence.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.520]   I'll also talk about some studies
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.900]   that have really focused on why relationships succeed
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.180]   and why they fail and how that relates to whether or not
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.420]   there is sufficient amounts of attachment and desire.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.740]   So today, we're going to talk about the science
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.700]   and indeed, you'll also get some tools.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.980]   Those tools should be useful to you,
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.140]   whether or not you happen to be in a relationship or not,
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.300]   whether or not you're seeking a relationship or not.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.940]   I'd like to begin with an anecdote,
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.640]   and this is not an anecdote about my relationship history.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.080]   It's a anecdote about my scientific history.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.460]   When I started graduate school,
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.940]   the chairman of the department I was in at the time
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.980]   said to me, "You know, most PhDs last longer
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.120]   than most marriages."
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.620]   And indeed, he was right.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.440]   And also, most marriages in this country end in divorce.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.900]   I think it's about 50% with a slight skew
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.060]   toward more ending in divorce than persist
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.380]   until death do them part.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.740]   But nonetheless, it's about half,
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.800]   and most marriages end before the eight-year period is up.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.660]   Most PhDs take anywhere from four to nine years.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.840]   So there was a bit of a smearing of averages there,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.140]   but the point he was trying to make
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.200]   really landed home for me.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.260]   It did not scare me out of relationships,
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.040]   nor did it scare me out of a PhD, obviously.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.960]   What it did illustrate was that there's something
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.760]   about our attachment machinery that can be very,
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.160]   very compelling such that people take on
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.940]   tremendous levels of commitment.
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.300]   I have to imagine that most people enter marriages
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.900]   assuming that they're going to stay in those marriages.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.040]   I don't think most people enter marriages
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.480]   thinking they're going to get divorced,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.120]   but that if 50% of those commitments end in divorce,
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.840]   there must also be mechanisms
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.700]   by which our attachments can break.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.040]   And today, we're going to talk about
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.660]   both the forming of attachments
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.320]   and the breaking of attachments,
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.640]   what can prevent those breaks in attachments,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.000]   and indeed, what can lead to reattachments.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.400]   There are biological mechanisms
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.880]   to desire, love, and attachment.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.740]   That's abundantly clear.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.520]   Now, there's a robust and very large literature
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.840]   in animal models.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.660]   What I mean by that are field studies
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.040]   and laboratory studies in primates of different kinds,
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.400]   such as macaque monkeys or bonobos.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.940]   People have looked at these sorts of things,
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.760]   believe it or not, in ducks, in laboratory mice,
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.480]   in different types of birds, et cetera.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.800]   And if you look at that literature,
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.640]   you can essentially find biological examples
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.120]   in the animal kingdom for just about any behavior
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.800]   that you can easily map to human behavior.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.560]   So for instance, there's a species of animal
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.800]   called the prairie vole.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.300]   In one portion of the United States,
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.400]   this prairie vole species is monogamous.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.560]   They only mate with one other prairie vole,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.520]   only raise young with one other prairie vole
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.480]   for their entire life.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.040]   And in another region of the United States,
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.080]   the same species of animal, the prairie vole,
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.720]   will mate with many individuals.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.040]   They're non-monogamous.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.380]   And the major difference, at least as far as we know,
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.360]   between the prairie voles in one location
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.920]   and another location is the levels of a molecule
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   called vasopressin in the brain and body.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.000]   Vasopressin is present in humans.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.360]   It has numerous biological roles.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.840]   It's responsible, for instance,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.400]   for controlling the amount of urine that you excrete,
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.080]   the amount of water that you retain,
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.360]   and for sexual desire, as well as mate seeking.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.680]   Levels of vasopressin in prairie voles
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.400]   are strongly determinant of whether or not a prairie vole
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.320]   is going to be monogamous or non-monogamous.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.220]   Why do I raise this?
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.520]   Well, I raise this because the literature on prairie voles
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.000]   is quite beautiful and has been discussed quite a lot
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.820]   in the popular press.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.980]   You can look it up with an easily just a web engine search.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.520]   You'll find lots of information about this,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.960]   lots of news articles about this,
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.880]   and lots of interpretations as to how vasopressin
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.600]   might be involved in similar different mechanisms in humans.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.320]   Now, I don't have a problem
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.280]   with mapping animal studies to humans.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.160]   I think there's certainly a place for that.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.380]   But if we just sort of lean back
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.640]   and look at the giant mass of studies in animals
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.440]   and their mating behavior and their mate selection behavior,
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.840]   you can essentially find examples of anything.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.960]   You can find examples of polygamy.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.400]   You can find examples of cheating, of infidelity.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.160]   You can find examples of all sorts of different behaviors
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.280]   that in your own mind, you can map to human behavior.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.560]   But it's really hard to make the leap from animal models
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.560]   to humans in any kind of direct way.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.840]   And so thankfully, there's been tremendous work done
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.240]   in the last mainly 20 years or so
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.440]   looking at human mate selection, human desire,
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   human love, and human attachment.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.440]   So we're mainly going to focus on those studies today.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.880]   And where appropriate, we will map those findings
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.720]   back to the findings in animals
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.080]   to see if there are some universal truths
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.280]   or some universal principles about how the neural circuits
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.000]   and biological mechanisms work.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.160]   But by and large, we're going to focus
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.300]   on human studies today.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.680]   So unless I say otherwise,
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.100]   the data that I'm referring to today
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.160]   are entirely from human beings.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.240]   So let's talk about attachment and attachment styles.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.840]   And this will offer you the opportunity
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.120]   to answer some important questions for yourself,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.240]   such as what is my, meaning your,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.440]   attachment style in relationship?
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.340]   One of the most robust findings in the field of psychology
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.680]   is this notion of attachment styles.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.620]   And this was something that was discovered
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.280]   through a beautiful set of studies
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.740]   that were done by Mary Ainsworth in the 1980s
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.240]   in which she developed a laboratory condition
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.880]   called the strange situation task.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.520]   Now, the strange situation task has been studied
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.120]   over and over again in different cultures,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.360]   in different locations throughout the world.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.580]   And in preparing for this episode,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.400]   I actually spoke to three different psychologists.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.720]   I spoke to a psychoanalyst,
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.580]   I spoke to a cognitive behavioral psychologist,
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.040]   and I actually spoke to a psychiatrist,
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.160]   excuse me, not a psychologist,
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.240]   but a psychiatrist with a medical degree and asked,
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.960]   is the strange situation task
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.880]   and the various attachment styles
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.240]   that emerge from that task,
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   are those still considered valid?
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.860]   And indeed all three of them said,
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.160]   if ever there was a literature in psychology
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.140]   that is absolutely tamped down and has a firm basis
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.120]   in both data and real world principles
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.960]   and real world examples,
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.500]   it's this notion of attachment styles.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.560]   So what is the strange situation task?
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.160]   The strange situation task involves a parent,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.740]   typically a mother in the studies that were done,
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.880]   but a parent or other caregiver bringing their child,
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.520]   their actual child into a laboratory.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.040]   And there's a room with a stranger
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.840]   and the mother enters the room with the child
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.040]   and there's some toys in the room
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.400]   and typically the mother and the stranger will talk,
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.240]   obviously the stranger is part of the experiment,
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.640]   it's not just some random person off the street,
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.140]   and the child is allowed to move about the room,
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.480]   they can observe the mother
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.720]   interacting with the other person or not,
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.480]   they can play with toys or not,
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.760]   but then at some point the mother leaves
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.160]   and then at some point later,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.520]   designated by the experimenter, the mother comes back.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.380]   And what is measured in these studies
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.800]   is both how the child, the toddler,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.960]   reacts to the mother leaving
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.000]   and how the child reacts to the mother returning
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.960]   at the end of the experiment.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.680]   And oftentimes this will have two or three different phases
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   where the mother will bring the child in,
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.440]   then leave, then come back in and leave.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.240]   There are also studies in which the behavior of the child
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.080]   with the stranger is also examined.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.540]   So there are a lot of variations of this,
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:48.540]   but the basic findings are that toddlers, children,
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:54.580]   fall into four different categories of attachment style
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.640]   and that these attachment styles
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.680]   can predict many features of adolescent,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.480]   teen, young adult, and even adult attachment styles,
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.640]   not in strange situations of the sort that I just described,
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.580]   but in romantic attachments.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:14.560]   I should mention also that attachment style is plastic,
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.240]   meaning it can change across the lifespan.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.660]   So as I described the results,
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.680]   I described the different attachment styles
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.640]   that are out there.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.880]   And if any of those resonate with you
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.880]   or bring to mind certain people in your life,
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.600]   please do not assume that those attachment styles
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.240]   are rigid and fixed for the entire lifespan.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.920]   There are also terrific data that indicate
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.520]   that through specific processes,
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.500]   both psychological and some biological adjustments,
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.000]   that people can change their attachment style
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.580]   and that indeed people who have different attachment styles
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.880]   can change the attachment styles of others.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.300]   But just to make very clear
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.720]   what the results of the study were,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.400]   I want to review what the four different attachment styles
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.640]   are and typically people fall into one group or another,
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.960]   but not several.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.820]   So the four patterns of attachment
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.120]   that were revealed by these studies,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.780]   again, were revealed by examining the behavior of the child
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.160]   in response to the mother leaving and the mother returning
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.320]   and the child's response to the stranger
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.680]   that is in the room with them.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.080]   The first style is the so-called secure attachment style.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.560]   In the nomenclature of this kind of study,
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.200]   these are the so-called B babies as in the letter B,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.440]   bulldog, B, not for bulldogs,
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.960]   but just to designate this category.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.800]   The secure attachment style is one in which the child
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.040]   will engage with the stranger, with the experimenter
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.280]   while the parent is present in the room,
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.480]   but that when the parent, typically it's a mother,
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.840]   but when the parent or other caregiver leaves,
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.960]   the child does get visibly upset.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.440]   They might whine, they might cry,
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.440]   they might even tantrum a bit.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.840]   However, when the caregiver,
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.320]   meaning the mother or father or other caregiver returns,
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.220]   the child visibly expresses happiness
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.000]   that the caregiver has returned, okay?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.680]   So that's the hallmark of the secure attachment style.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.580]   And again, this is all preverbal.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.680]   This is happening long before the child can express
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.800]   how they feel with words.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.720]   And the interpretation of this is that the secure child
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.800]   feels confident that the caregiver is available
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.320]   and will be responsive to their needs
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.160]   and their communications.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.120]   So that when the child whines or is distressed,
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.860]   the parent doesn't come right back into the room,
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.160]   but at some point they do.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.320]   And they seem to have a sense of trust
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.520]   that if the parent or caregiver leaves,
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.240]   that the parent will come back
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.780]   and that they're happy that they do.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.020]   These children are also very good
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.300]   at exploring novel environments after the parent is gone
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.880]   and while the parent is there.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.540]   And almost always when the parent is there,
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.080]   they will explore more broadly, literally in space,
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.600]   they'll venture out further than they will
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.920]   when the parent is gone.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.520]   They also tend to engage with the caregiver in a way
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.840]   that's not immediately and completely trusting,
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.280]   but that over time seems to evolve
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.340]   from one in which they're kind of suspicious of this person
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.880]   to one in which they're at least somewhat trusting, okay?
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.940]   So those are the general contours
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.680]   of the secure attachment style.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.560]   And fortunately, nowadays there are physiological studies
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.680]   measuring things like heart rate and breathing
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.400]   and other measures that correlate with the subjective
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.040]   assessment of what these children are feeling.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.120]   Okay, so first category is secure attached.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.760]   The second category is a so-called anxious avoidant
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.560]   or insecurely attached, which are the category A babies.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.620]   The children with anxious avoidant
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.160]   insecure attachment patterns generally tend to avoid
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.560]   or ignore the caregiver, all right?
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.660]   Meaning the parent and show very little emotion
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.220]   when the parent leaves or returns.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.960]   So this is the reason they call them avoidant
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.380]   or anxious avoidant and kind of insecure.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.360]   There isn't this happiness or joy that the parent is back.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.280]   They don't seem to express that.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.540]   They do not exhibit distress on separation,
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:08.480]   and they generally tend to have some tendency
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.020]   to approach the caregiver when they return,
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.280]   but there doesn't seem to be a general expression of joy.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.920]   And again, physiological measures support that as well.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.700]   Things like changes in heart rate tend to be less dramatic
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.200]   in the anxious avoidant insecure attachment style
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.940]   than in the secure attachment style.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.680]   Okay, so that's the second one.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.420]   The third category is the so-called anxious ambivalent
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.400]   slash resistant insecure category.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.720]   Okay, I didn't name these categories,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.780]   so you have to blame others in this one instance.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.760]   For everything else, blame me.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.720]   But in this instance, you have to blame the psychologists
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.880]   that named this category.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.680]   The anxious ambivalent slash resistant insecure category,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.000]   also called the C babies,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.020]   for the letter C, just as a categorization.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:58.760]   The anxious ambivalent resistant insecure toddlers, really,
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.920]   show distress even before separation from their mother
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.840]   or other caregiver, and they tend to be very clingy
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.880]   and difficult to comfort when the caregiver returns.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.240]   Okay, so they're distressed
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.160]   even before the mother leaves the room,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.040]   and they tend to be very clingy
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.740]   and really hard to calm down when the mother returns.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:21.560]   They tend to show either what seems to be resentment
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.440]   in response to the parents' absence,
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.920]   we don't really know what they're feeling,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.940]   or some sort of helpless passivity.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.520]   And there's actually subcategorizations
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.840]   that the psychologists have come up with
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.920]   with C1 subtypes and C2 subtypes.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.560]   We don't have to get bogged down in that.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.960]   But just know that there isn't one absolute measure
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.360]   that says, oh, well, this person is anxious ambivalent,
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.620]   resistant, insecure.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:46.340]   They could be somewhat passive, or they could be somewhat
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.740]   angry at the caregiver.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.740]   But the basic idea is that before and after the separation,
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.260]   they are clingy and difficult to comfort.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.920]   They just can't seem to calm themselves down.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.900]   And physiological measures of heart rate
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.000]   and hormone measurements, such as cortisol,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.820]   also support that statement.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.500]   And the third category of attachment style
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.300]   is the so-called disorganized or disoriented,
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.120]   or D for the letter D, babies.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.760]   This is a categorization that was added later
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.660]   to this strange situation task that is a real hallmark
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.400]   of developmental psychology studies.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.320]   It was developed by Mary Ainsworth graduate student,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.600]   Mary Main, who I actually had the great fortune
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.240]   of taking a course from and learning from
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.700]   when I was a graduate student at Berkeley many years ago.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.820]   And this fourth categorization was controversial
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.760]   for a while, but now is generally accepted.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.160]   The key feature of the disorganized, disoriented category
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.420]   is that the toddlers tend to be tense
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.300]   and they tend to encompass a lot
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.580]   of kind of odd physical postures.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.920]   They tend to hunch their shoulders.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.680]   They'll put their hands behind their neck.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.200]   They'll cock their head to the side.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.100]   For those of you listening,
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.700]   I'm doing this on the video version.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.980]   It's not where you don't have to go see that.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.420]   But for those of you that are watching this on video,
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.300]   they tend to kind of constrain their body size a bit
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.500]   and go into odd postures that they normally
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.300]   wouldn't do anywhere else.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.500]   So this is why it's called the disorganized
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.020]   or disoriented category.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.140]   It seems like these children just don't really know
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.100]   how to react to a separation.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.740]   And they just start to manifest behaviors
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.060]   and emotional tones that aren't observed
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.680]   in other situations.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.780]   Okay, so we've got our four categories.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.500]   I'll try and use the shortest possible names
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.340]   for each category.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.640]   We've got category one, which is securely attached.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.720]   We've got category two, which is insecurely attached,
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.120]   also sometimes called anxious avoidant.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.520]   Then we've got category three,
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.700]   which is the resistant insecure category,
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.020]   which is anxious ambivalent.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.840]   And then there's this fourth category,
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.420]   the disorganized disoriented category
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.900]   where the so-called D babies.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.700]   Now, what's interesting about this from the perspective
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:59.700]   of desire, love and attachment is that the categorizations
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.500]   of children into one of these four different categories
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.540]   as toddlers is strongly predictive
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.280]   of their attachment style
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   in romantic partnerships later in life,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.880]   which is to me both amazing and surprising
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.080]   and not surprising all at the same time.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.880]   Amazing because it means that, first of all,
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.680]   we are relatively hardwired for attachment.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.640]   I think that that's incredible and beautiful
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.660]   that we have designated neurons, nerve cells
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.600]   and hormonal systems that are there to ensure
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.060]   that we have some sort of response to a caregiver being there
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.160]   or not being there or returning or leaving,
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.800]   but also that the same neural circuitries,
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.940]   the same hormonal responses are at least in some way
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.340]   repurposed for entirely different types
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.260]   of attachments later in life.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.740]   So when we hear the psychologists talk about
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.680]   how we formed a template early in life
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.080]   based on experiences that were even pre-verbal
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.060]   before we had language and those templates
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.300]   are superimposed on our relationships,
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.380]   or we should say our later relationships
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.060]   are superimposed on those templates,
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.660]   there really is a basis for that.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.380]   We now have neuroimaging studies to support,
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.740]   for instance, the work of Alan Shore from UCLA,
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:20.220]   showing that when a mother and child interact,
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.060]   either through very soothing interactions
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.160]   like bottle feeding or breastfeeding
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.240]   or singing to one's baby or putting them to sleep,
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.540]   that the brain of the child and the brain of the mother
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.620]   are entering a coordinated state of relaxation.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.900]   And it's not one direction mother to child,
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.260]   the child is also calming the mother.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.100]   Typically these studies were done with mothers,
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.120]   again, sometimes with fathers, but typically with mothers.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.540]   And in addition to that,
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.400]   when the mother or other caregiver acts very excited
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.340]   and raises their voice or puts a lilt in their voice
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.460]   or widens their eyes, that the child will do the same.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.080]   And again, there's a bi-directional interaction
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.120]   in that case of excitement.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.180]   And there's the release of neurochemicals
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.760]   like dopamine into the bloodstream,
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.600]   whereas in the relaxation scenario
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.100]   and the soothing scenario,
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.820]   we know the release of things like serotonin and oxytocin.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.500]   So the neural systems for attachment
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.860]   and the neural systems for what we call autonomic arousal
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.700]   for being alert and calm don't act in a vacuum.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.380]   They are tethered to other people in our environment.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.880]   And of course we know this, right?
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.060]   We sometimes hear the statement,
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.740]   "No one can make you feel anything."
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.960]   I've always had a little bit of a problem
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   with that statement.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.860]   I don't think I'm contradicting anyone in particular,
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.700]   but you hear that a lot.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.380]   No one can make you feel anything.
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.620]   Indeed they can, right?
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.220]   A physical injury can make you feel something.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.420]   If somebody says something that you very much like,
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.680]   it can make you feel something.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.300]   And if somebody says something that you very much dislike,
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.560]   it will make you feel something.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.940]   So the idea that no one can make us feel anything
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.060]   isn't actually true.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.340]   Our nervous system is tethered
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.260]   to the nervous systems of others.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.540]   And that is true from the very earliest stages of our lives.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.180]   And in this case, we're talking about
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.920]   how our templates for attachment in romantic relationships,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.220]   how we find them, how we maintain them,
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.980]   and indeed how we break them and reform them
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.300]   is based on a template that was established
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.580]   through an entirely different set of priorities,
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.340]   which was how we feel safe and secure in novel environments
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.220]   depending on whether or not our primary caregiver
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   is there or not.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.900]   Neuroimaging supports that.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.420]   When I say neuroimaging, I mean brain scans support that.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.100]   Measures of hormones in the body and brain support that.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.020]   Measures of neurochemicals support that.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.260]   There's simply no way around this truth
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.080]   that we have a set of roadmaps in our mind
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.260]   that are reused for entirely different purposes
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.180]   later in life.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.740]   That is vitally important to understand
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.740]   because if one is successful in forming romantic attachments,
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.820]   maintaining them, et cetera, or not,
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.840]   does in fact reflect the earlier templates
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.100]   that you've created.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.500]   But as I've mentioned before, the good news is
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.620]   that these templates can shift over time.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.160]   And one of the more powerful ways
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.140]   to shift those templates over time
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.980]   is purely by the knowledge that they exist
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.880]   and the understanding that those templates are malleable.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.580]   They can change through the process of neuroplasticity.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.540]   Again, neuroplasticity is just a rewiring
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.740]   of nerve connections that is very much present in childhood,
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.900]   but also very much present in adulthood.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.460]   So if you're somebody who you think falls
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.700]   into category one, two, three, or four,
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.780]   or you know somebody or involved with somebody
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.220]   who falls into category one, two, three, and four,
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.100]   the mere knowledge of that can be very useful.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.140]   But you might ask, well, what do I do with that knowledge?
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.380]   Well, fortunately, both psychologists and biologists
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.420]   have started to leverage that knowledge
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.500]   toward establishing better, more secure bonds
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.260]   in adult romantic relationships.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.220]   And there's a book that has really tapped into this.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.140]   I think it's the first book
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.860]   that has really addressed this head on.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.460]   And that book comes from two Columbia professors.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.460]   And the title of the book is "Attached,
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.260]   "The New Science of Adult Attachment
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.060]   "and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love."
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:11.180]   The authors of this book are Amir Levine and Rachel Heller.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:15.020]   Again, both of them are skilled academics and researchers
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.660]   who have really taken the literature that I described
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.060]   on the strange situation task
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.100]   and mapped it to adult attachment styles.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.900]   And also they've mapped out ways
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.260]   that they've observed in their clinical practice
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.480]   and that is laboratory supported for, for instance,
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.540]   people that have an anxious ambivalent
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.820]   or what we would call an insecure attachment style,
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.180]   or for people that fall into the disorganized
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.780]   or disoriented attachment style,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.180]   how they can modify that attachment style
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.820]   in or out of relationships in order to establish
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.860]   what I think everybody wants, which is secure attachment.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.100]   Why does everybody want that?
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.020]   Well, secure attachment allows people
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.020]   to be both in relationship,
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.180]   or if they choose to be on their own,
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.580]   or to be in relationship,
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.460]   but physically separated from somebody else,
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.540]   or even emotionally separated from somebody else,
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.500]   and maintain what we call a stable autonomic equilibrium,
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.300]   the ability to remain calm, clear-headed.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.960]   You might not like what's happening,
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.660]   but you're able to navigate that with some sense of clarity
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.740]   and not excessive discomfort.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.700]   So is there a goal in all of this stuff about love, desire,
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.540]   and attachment?
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.580]   Indeed, there is.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.460]   The secure attachment style is the one that leads
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.100]   to the most stable and predictable long-term relationships.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:32.700]   Put differently, babies, toddlers, adolescents, teens,
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.320]   and young adults that have a secure attachment style
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.480]   are more likely to find and form long-term relationships
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.780]   than are people in the other categories.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.740]   But people in other categories can learn
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.660]   and eventually migrate into the secure attachment style.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.900]   And I think that book "Attached,"
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.540]   I have no affiliation to the authors or the book itself,
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.840]   I should just mention that,
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.700]   "Attached, The New Science of Adult Attachment
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.500]   and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love,"
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.740]   really, it sounds very pop psychology-esque,
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.020]   but it is really grounded
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.840]   in the research psychology literature,
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.920]   and there's also some interesting biology there.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.760]   Another point to make about attachment styles
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.300]   is that it is possible,
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.900]   and some of you may be familiar with circumstances,
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.060]   whereby people who are securely attached,
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.900]   either because they grew up in an environment
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.060]   where secure attachment was cultivated
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.560]   or because they developed that on their own,
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.980]   can also migrate out of the securely attached category
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.560]   into insecurely attached
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.340]   or into avoidant types of attachment styles
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.300]   as teens or as young adults
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.740]   or as adults at any age or any stage of life,
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.760]   by virtue of being with somebody who has a different,
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.280]   perhaps less adaptive attachment style, right?
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.620]   What this means is that if you have
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.920]   or you develop a secure attachment style,
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.600]   it's vitally important to protect that attachment style
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.160]   because it is possible to become anxiously attached
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.180]   even if you grew up in a stable attachment framework,
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.660]   and again, this can happen at any stage.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.460]   So if you're interested in attachment styles
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.680]   and how they influence adult romantic attachments,
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.380]   and certainly if you are a parent,
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.700]   I would encourage you to check out the book "Attached."
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.000]   Again, it's quite good,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.760]   and I think that it offers a number of actionable tools
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.460]   to both form and hold on to secure attachment styles.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.000]   So I mentioned that the neural circuits
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.240]   for child-parent or child-caregiver attachment
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.420]   are repurposed for romantic attachment later in life,
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.800]   but what are these neural circuits?
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.740]   What do they do?
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.100]   I mean, it's so attractive, if you will,
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.660]   to think about a brain area that controls love
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.760]   or a brain area that controls desire
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.360]   or a brain area that controls attachment,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.220]   but it simply doesn't work that way.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.480]   As I've talked about before on this podcast,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.800]   and I will say again and again,
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.860]   because it will persist to be true long after I'm gone,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.680]   is that no one brain area can give rise
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:01.020]   to anything as complex as desire, love, or attachment.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.300]   Instead, there are multiple brain areas
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.520]   that through their coordinated action
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.260]   create a sort of a song that we call desire
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.920]   or a song that we call love
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   or a song that we call attachment, not a literal song,
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.960]   although there are songs about desire, love, and attachment,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.100]   of course, many songs, some good, some not so good,
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.240]   but rather different brain areas being active
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.120]   in different sequences and with different intensities
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.620]   can make us feel as if we are in the mode
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.700]   that we call desire or in the mode of love
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.560]   or in the mode of attachment.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.360]   But beneath all of that is this element
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.760]   of autonomic arousal, and I want to focus
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.460]   on autonomic arousal just for a bit longer
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:45.240]   because it really is one of the three core elements
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.660]   by which we form and maintain loving attachments
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.360]   and by which we break loving attachments.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.160]   The autonomic nervous system, as the name suggests,
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.040]   is automatic, in fact, that's what autonomic means.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.040]   Now, it's actually the case
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.880]   that we can control our autonomic nervous system
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.140]   to some degree or another,
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.260]   but the autonomic nervous system controls things
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.340]   like digestion, our breathing,
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.860]   whether or not we're conscious of that breathing or not.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.220]   It controls things like how alert we are
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.940]   or how sleepy we are.
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.080]   And the autonomic nervous system,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.940]   as I just briefly described earlier,
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.700]   is really something that we come into the world with.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.440]   It's hardwired, all the elements are there,
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.420]   but through interactions with our parent,
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.740]   either soothing interactions or fun, playful interactions,
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.460]   or dare I say, scary interactions,
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.700]   our autonomic nervous system gets tuned up,
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.560]   meaning we each develop a tendency
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.900]   to either be more alert and anxious or more calm
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.020]   or kind of a balance of alert and calm.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.020]   Now, of course, this changes across each day
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.740]   and depending how tired we are late in the day,
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.740]   if we've been awake for a while, we tend to get sleepy.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.160]   Early in the day, if we're very rested,
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.280]   we tend to wake up and feel very alert.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.040]   So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.500]   is it's kind of a seesaw.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.140]   We go back and forth between being very alert,
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.760]   we can be alert and calm, or we can be very, very alert,
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.900]   we can be in a state of panic, we can be fast asleep,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.220]   so we can be extremely calm,
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.060]   or we can just be kind of sleepy, semi-calm,
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.900]   but still also alert.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.020]   So think about it like a seesaw.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.940]   And that seesaw has a hinge.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.220]   And that hinge defines how tight or loose that seesaw is,
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.100]   how readily it can tilt back and forth.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:30.140]   Our autonomic tone is how tight that hinge is.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.140]   And there are biological mechanisms to explain this,
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.740]   but here I just want to stay with the analogy
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.020]   of the seesaw for now.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:41.680]   The interactions between child and caregiver early in life
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.240]   take the child and the caregiver
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.020]   from one end of the seesaw to the other,
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.140]   from being very alert in a state of play, for instance,
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.980]   to being nursed and being very soothed until we go to sleep.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.940]   And of course, we each have a seesaw,
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.340]   the parent and the child has a seesaw,
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.180]   and they're interacting.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.360]   What do I mean by that?
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.940]   Well, there are beautiful studies and beautiful,
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.240]   not in the sense that they focused on a pleasant topic,
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.380]   but beautiful because they were done so beautifully well,
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.980]   that looked at, for instance,
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.740]   the response of mothers and their physiologies
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.820]   and the response of children and their physiologies
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.520]   during the bombing of cities during World War II.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.500]   So an unpleasant situation,
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:25.100]   but what was revealed during the course of these studies
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.700]   was that if the mothers were very stressed
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.540]   during an onslaught of bombing of the city,
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.880]   the children's physiologies tended to be stressed also
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.420]   and persisted in being stressed
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:41.560]   long after that stressful episode was done.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.020]   They actually followed that these children well out
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.360]   for many decades afterwards.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.800]   Conversely, if the parent, and in this case, again,
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.700]   it was mothers that were explored in these studies,
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.460]   had turned this whole business
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:59.100]   of going into the bomb shelters into somewhat of a game,
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.660]   taking it seriously, but essentially telling the children,
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.500]   okay, it's time to go,
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.820]   but not expressing much stress or distress.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.560]   The children also didn't develop much stress
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.340]   or distress or trauma.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.940]   Now, there were exceptions to this, of course,
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.480]   but in general, that was the rule
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.860]   that the autonomic nervous systems of children
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.900]   tend to mimic the autonomic nervous systems
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.760]   of the primary caregiver.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.580]   And the mechanisms by which this occurs has been explored.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.580]   And again, I just refer to the beautiful work of Alan Shore
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.120]   at University of California, Los Angeles.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:32.240]   And then again, his name is Shore, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.880]   I'm looking down briefly at the floor here
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.540]   because I'll just reach for the book.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.700]   He has a wonderful book called "Right Brain Psychotherapy."
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.720]   It's a little bit technical,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.180]   but if you're interested in some of the studies,
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.940]   this book, "Right Brain Psychotherapy,"
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.380]   details how everything from nursing of children
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.300]   to playtime behavior,
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.820]   to strange situation type task behavior
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.660]   that we talked about before,
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:56.100]   which of course occurs when children get dropped off
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.580]   at daycare or nursery school or with babysitters, et cetera.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:04.040]   And indeed, all types of caregiver-child interactions
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.860]   tune up that autonomic nervous system
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.180]   so that the child ends up with an autonomic nervous system
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.660]   that either tends to lean more towards alert and anxious,
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.540]   or can be very alert but calm,
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.420]   or can be very calm and hard to budge.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.780]   Again, it's the tightness of that hinge
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.740]   that really underlies these attachment styles
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.220]   that we were talking about earlier.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.980]   And not on this episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.580]   but on many other previous episodes,
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.700]   such as the Master Stress episode,
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.620]   or some of the Optimize Health episodes.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.940]   You can find these if you want at hubermanlab.com.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.180]   A lot of the tools and techniques that are recommended there
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.860]   have to do with readjusting the autonomic nervous system
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.540]   in deliberate ways as an adult.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.560]   Again, I won't go into the specific tools,
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.620]   but for instance, the physiological sigh,
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.140]   this tool that I've talked about extensively
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.320]   of two inhales through the nose,
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.860]   as deeply as you can on the first one,
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.820]   sneaking in a little bit more air on the second one,
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.860]   and then a long exhale through the mouth,
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.660]   is a way of adjusting that autonomic seesaw.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.300]   It tends to make us more calm.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.420]   It activates what we call the parasympathetic arm
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.840]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.220]   which is just fancy nerd speak
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.260]   for it's a quick way to calm yourself down, right?
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.420]   Things like ice baths, or cold showers,
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.460]   or cold immersion, or hyperventilate hyperventilation,
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:27.820]   by contrast, are ways in which we can deliberately increase
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.540]   the level of our so-called sympathetic arm
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.820]   of our autonomic nervous system to make ourselves more alert.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.860]   Why would you want to do that?
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.800]   Well, you can do that to be more alert,
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.240]   to be more awake if you like,
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.460]   or as a form of self-induced stress inoculation
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:43.740]   to be able to tolerate higher levels of adrenaline
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.320]   by making it a practice that you self-direct.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.460]   The reason those tools are out there is because many of us,
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.340]   for whatever reason, we don't have to blame anyone,
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.840]   but because of our childhood templates,
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.740]   because of things that happened and didn't happen
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.740]   in terms of our interactions with caregivers,
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.740]   have autonomic nervous systems that are tilted
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.380]   to one side or the other more than we would like,
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.140]   or in which the hinge that I'm talking about
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:13.000]   in this analogy is too loose or that is too tight,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.960]   and we're sort of stuck in a mode of anxiousness
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.140]   or stuck in a mode of lack of energy.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.520]   That's what those tools are really about.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   But at a deeper level, the autonomic nervous system
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.860]   is really the system that governs how we will react
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:32.860]   in response to a romantic partner being present or leaving.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.640]   And I don't necessarily mean leaving the relationship
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.740]   entirely, although it could mean that, right?
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.620]   We know people, I'm sure you know people,
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.080]   that upon the end of a relationship
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.940]   that they wanted very much are absolutely crushed.
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.540]   And actually, in researching this episode there,
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.180]   I discovered there's an extensive literature finding
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.960]   that the feelings that one has after a breakup
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.300]   are very much like a clinical depression in many cases.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.820]   But there are individuals that can look at a breakup
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.300]   as a transient event that they don't interpret
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.220]   as going to mean so much for all aspects of their life
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.600]   or reshaping their view of themselves.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.440]   Why?
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.120]   Well, we have different levels of autonomic function.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.760]   And depending on where our seesaw is, if you will,
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.060]   some of us become extremely distraught
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.760]   and can't recalibrate ourselves,
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.340]   can't adjust ourselves down from stress to calm,
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.700]   or can't take ourselves from exhausted to more alert
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.420]   if we need to do that on our own.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.820]   And so that's why tools for doing that exist.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:37.160]   But attachment itself is about
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.700]   where our autonomic nervous system resides.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.820]   So if I were to offer a set of tools
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.620]   around these topics of desire, love, and attachment,
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.340]   I would say, first of all, you might want to think about
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.700]   whether or not you fall into the secure, insecure
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.340]   or other attachment styles.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:55.340]   Second, I think it is vitally important for all of us,
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:58.120]   but certainly for people that are in relationships
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.460]   or seeking relationships,
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.020]   to be able to at least have some recognition
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.780]   of where our autonomic nervous system tends to reside,
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.900]   both in terms of when we are with somebody
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.380]   and when they leave.
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.300]   When we are apart for long periods of time,
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.280]   can we calm ourselves?
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.860]   Can we self-soothe?
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.940]   Or are we very much dependent on the presence of another
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.460]   in order to feel soothed?
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.900]   Now, I absolutely want to emphasize
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.340]   that there is nothing wrong.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.140]   In fact, there's everything right with feeling great
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.540]   in the presence of somebody else.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.560]   That is actually a hallmark of strong
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.060]   and quality attachments.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.860]   These days, we hear the term codependent a lot.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.160]   This was a, I believe the term was first coined
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.780]   by Pia Mellody, and it actually does occupy
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:44.520]   an important role in the world of trauma, trauma healing,
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.160]   so-called trauma bonding, topics of another episode.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.900]   I actually did an episode on fear and trauma,
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.620]   and we will do one all about trauma bonding
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.900]   with an expert at some point in the future.
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.980]   But codependence and codependency,
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.660]   the term can sometimes be misinterpreted
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:03.500]   as any dependence on another isn't good.
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.060]   Interdependence, healthy interdependence, of course, is good.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.700]   It is the hallmark of healthy child-parent relations,
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.480]   sibling relations, and romantic relations.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:17.020]   But a key element of healthy interdependence is that yes,
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.180]   our autonomic nervous system is adjusted
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.780]   by the presence of another,
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.460]   but that also that we can adjust
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.020]   our own autonomic nervous system
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.380]   even in the absence of that person.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:30.140]   That if the person goes away temporarily or permanently,
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.600]   that we can still regulate our own autonomic nervous system,
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.900]   both from states of stress to states of calm,
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.340]   both from states of exhaustion to states of more alertness.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.620]   And of course, we all need sleep
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.820]   to go from exhaustion to alertness.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.740]   But what I'm referring to here is the ability
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:50.740]   to regulate when distraught or regulate when fatigued
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.820]   or feeling depressed.
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.980]   And that is and is all about the autonomic nervous system.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.660]   So as we talk about attachment styles
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.860]   and we talk about infant and toddler
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.920]   and adult attachment styles,
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.880]   what we are really talking about
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.780]   is a complex set of neural circuitries.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.760]   And one of those neural circuitries,
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.020]   which is absolutely crucial,
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.020]   is this autonomic nervous system.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:14.780]   So if the autonomic nervous system is one key component
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:18.840]   of desire, love, and attachment, what are the other two?
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.860]   And what I'm going to tell you next
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.620]   is largely the pioneering work of Helen Fisher,
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.640]   who is really an anthropologist
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.580]   who's become a bit of a neuroscientist
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.740]   and has collaborated with neuroscientists
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.460]   to establish brain areas and neural circuits
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.180]   that are associated with different aspects
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:36.980]   of attachment, love, and desire.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.660]   I think the first really high quality study
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.700]   of neural circuits associated with these themes
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.540]   was a paper published in 2005
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.740]   in a very fine anatomical journal,
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.420]   perhaps the best neuroanatomical journal,
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:53.220]   which is the Journal of Comparative Neurology.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.480]   The Journal of Comparative Neurology
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.780]   has been around for more than a hundred years
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.940]   and is considered the archival location
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.740]   for placing really high quality anatomy.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.580]   They have tremendously high standards.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.740]   And the study that I'm referring to
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.460]   is entitled "Romantic Love and fMRI,"
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.500]   meaning functional magnetic resonance imaging study
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.860]   of a neural mechanism for mate choice.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:19.100]   And Dr. Fisher is a author on this paper,
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.940]   as is Arthur Aaron and Lucy Brown,
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.980]   so all very fine researchers.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.540]   And this study, as well as several other studies
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.500]   using magnetic resonance imaging,
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.700]   things like EEG, neuroanatomical tracing, et cetera,
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.660]   have identified a large number of brain areas
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.100]   that are associated with different aspects
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.500]   of desire, love, and attachment.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:39.820]   And I'll just throw out a few names
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.580]   of those brain areas and what they control,
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.860]   and then I'll tell you how those anchor
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:46.380]   to the other two categories of neural circuits
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.540]   essential for desire, love, and attachment.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:53.340]   So not surprisingly, the dopamine system in the brain
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.880]   is associated with desire, love, and attachment,
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.720]   and mainly with desire, although to some extent love.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.900]   Dopamine is a neurochemical sometimes associated
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:05.100]   with reward, but as some of you have heard me say before,
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:09.620]   it is mainly a molecule of motivation, craving, and pursuit.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.940]   And that motivation, craving, and pursuit
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.100]   that relates to dopamine is not unique
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.020]   to attachment or love or sex or mating, et cetera.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.840]   It is a universal generic currency in the brain
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.300]   for pursuing something.
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.300]   Food when you're hungry, a mate when you want one,
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.060]   two mate when you want two,
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.200]   warmth when you're cold, et cetera, et cetera, okay?
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.940]   So it's not for one specific purpose,
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:35.960]   but the brain areas associated with dopamine involve,
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.540]   for instance, the ventral tegmental area,
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:42.860]   the substantia nigra, areas of that sort, the basal ganglia.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.020]   You don't need to know these names.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.540]   Just understand that these are networks of neurons
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.100]   that tend to put the person, you,
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.660]   into a state of forward action and pursuit
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.980]   and craving and motivation.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:57.140]   They are not about being quiescent, relaxed, et cetera.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:01.740]   The neural circuits for quiescence and relaxation
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.740]   are most associated with love and attachment,
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.900]   not surprisingly, and they're the neurochemical serotonin
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.780]   and to some extent oxytocin
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.260]   are the predominant neurochemicals involved.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.800]   And those are released from brain areas
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.460]   such as the raphe nucleus in the back of the brain.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.780]   You may have heard that the majority of serotonin
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:22.060]   in your body is made in your gut, and indeed that's true,
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.580]   but I hate to break it to you.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.060]   The serotonin in your gut is not responsible
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.740]   for your feelings of love and attachment,
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.120]   at least not to a high degree.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.760]   That's mainly going to be the reflection of neurons
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.100]   in your brain that make serotonin.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.540]   And there are other areas of the brain
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.960]   that make serotonin as well and oxytocin as well,
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.340]   but they tend to be associated with the kind of warmth
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.380]   and calm and the soothing that we feel
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.540]   in the presence of another.
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.920]   And again, these are not strictly divided circuits.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.900]   We can have dopamine and serotonin present
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.700]   in our brain and body at the same time
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.020]   to equal or different degrees.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.320]   And we will return in a little bit to what happens
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.220]   when levels of dopamine are very high
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.140]   and levels of serotonin are low and vice versa and so on,
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:08.140]   including in states of neurochemically modified states
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.620]   as it were in when we talk about things like MDMA,
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.420]   so-called ecstasy.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:16.920]   But in the meantime, I want to just discuss
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:20.480]   the two neural circuits that use dopamine,
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.740]   that use serotonin and oxytocin,
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:26.100]   and that collaborate with the autonomic nervous system
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:29.320]   to drive what we call desire, love, and attachment.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.740]   And the three circuits are autonomic nervous system,
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.280]   we talked about that one.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.880]   Then there's the nervous system components
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.040]   or the neural circuits for empathy,
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:43.660]   for being able to see and respond to
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.680]   and indeed match the emotional tone
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.460]   or the autonomic tone of another.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.200]   And then there's the third category,
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.320]   and this might surprise some of you,
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.760]   it certainly surprised me,
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.360]   but the data point to the fact
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.840]   that the third neural circuit
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.820]   that's very important for establishing bonds
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.740]   is one associated with positive delusions.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.520]   So given that the neural circuits for empathy
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.420]   are absolutely crucial for falling in love
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:10.300]   and maintaining stable attachments,
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.740]   I'd like to talk about those neural circuits
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.260]   and what they are.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.140]   Now, often when we hear empathy,
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:18.500]   we think, oh, empathy is really about listening to
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.580]   and really understanding what somebody else is feeling,
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.940]   maybe even feeling what they're feeling.
[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.460]   And indeed that's the case,
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.540]   but what do we mean by that, right?
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.820]   What is it to feel what another feels?
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:33.140]   Well, what it means is that their seesaw
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:37.600]   is driving your seesaw or your seesaw
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.660]   is somehow driving their seesaw,
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.620]   that there's a match in terms of the tilt of those seesaws.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.620]   Now, it doesn't have to be an exact match, right?
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:47.620]   If someone that you really care about is very, very stressed,
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.300]   you could also become very stressed.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.900]   That's a form of empathic matching,
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:54.700]   and there are indeed neural circuits for that.
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:57.180]   I'll describe what those neural circuits are in a moment,
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.660]   but sometimes the best role for us to take
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.540]   is actually one in which we are calm
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.820]   when the person that we care about
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.720]   or that we are romantically involved with
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.060]   is very, very anxious.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.380]   And in a few minutes,
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.140]   I'll talk about how matching of emotional tone
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.840]   can be good or bad for the stability of a relationship.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:19.880]   And complementarity of autonomic matching
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.340]   can be good or bad.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.380]   In other words,
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:25.300]   sometimes it's beneficial for a relationship
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.900]   to go into the same state as the other.
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:29.900]   And sometimes it's more beneficial for us
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:33.660]   to not go into the same state as the other.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.900]   But the important feature here
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:39.020]   is that when we talk about emotional matching or empathy
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.300]   or going into the same state
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:41.740]   or not going into the same state,
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.340]   what we're really talking about
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:48.340]   is whether or not the autonomic seesaw of one individual
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:52.180]   is driving the autonomic seesaw of the other individual.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.500]   And this is a vital principle
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:57.540]   for how we fall in love and form attachments.
[00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.420]   And it's actually part of the desire and mating process
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.260]   itself.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.420]   I would go so far as to say
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.740]   that one of the prerequisites
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:11.840]   to the propagation and expansion of our species
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.440]   is this notion of autonomic regulation
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.720]   and to some extent matching of autonomic nervous systems.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.900]   Let me explain what I mean.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.320]   Last I checked,
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.680]   the only way that new humans can be created
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.060]   is by way of sperm meeting egg,
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.800]   either in body or in dish,
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.220]   but sperm meets egg.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.940]   And then typically nine months later,
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.100]   we have a human baby.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:39.360]   The process of bringing sperm to egg,
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.060]   mating behavior, sex behavior in humans
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.640]   is one of autonomic regulation.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.740]   And what I mean by that is
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:54.140]   the process of finding a mate.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:54.980]   And in this case,
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.140]   there's actually someone to mate with typically,
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.220]   while scenarios vary,
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.080]   typically is one of elevated autonomic arousal,
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.880]   meaning increased activation
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.060]   of the so-called sympathetic nervous system.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.140]   This is related to dopamine release
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.300]   and it's related to epinephrine release.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.100]   There has to be a pursuit
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.260]   or at least there has to be a mobilization
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:20.700]   to arrive in the same location whereby one can mate, right?
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.500]   That almost always is the case.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:28.540]   However, the sexual arousal itself
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:31.800]   is in both males and females
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   is actually driven primarily by the parasympathetic arm
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.980]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.720]   So while pursuit is one of alertness
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.420]   and sympathetic drive, as we say,
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.400]   again, sympathy is not really what's at play here,
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.980]   the word simpa means together
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.500]   and the activation of the autonomic nervous system
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.780]   toward more alert state
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.800]   is because of a sympathetic nervous system,
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.520]   meaning the co-activation together of many neurons
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.320]   in the brain and spinal cord.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.480]   But then the actual physiological arousal state
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.820]   that we call sexual arousal
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.960]   is predominantly parasympathetically driven, okay?
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.400]   To be quite direct about this,
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.320]   if the sympathetic nervous system activation is too high,
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.580]   the sexual arousal response cannot happen
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:20.120]   in either males or in females, it's inhibited.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.000]   However, the orgasm and ejaculation response,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.720]   which if you think about it is required
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.720]   for sperm to meet egg is sympathetic driven.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.380]   And then after orgasm and ejaculation,
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.040]   the parasympathetic nervous system kicks back in
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.320]   and there's a calming and relaxation.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.320]   So the arc of mating involves sympathetic arousal, okay?
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:52.240]   Not sympathy, but alertness and arousal for pursuit.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.200]   Then a tilt of the seesaw, at least to some degree
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.160]   for arousal of the sort that we typically hear of,
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.000]   of sexual arousal.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.640]   Then at the point of orgasm and ejaculation
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.200]   is back to a sympathetic response.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.400]   And how can I say that?
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.660]   How do I know that?
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.380]   The sympathetic nervous system,
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.280]   meaning neurons within the sympathetic arm
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.580]   of the autonomic nervous system
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:16.440]   are what drive ejaculation and orgasm.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.800]   And then afterward there's a return
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.000]   to increased parasympathetic activation.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.600]   And we don't know for sure why that happens,
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:30.700]   but it's thought that in species that pair bond,
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.000]   humans generally pair bond, not always,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.900]   the return to more parasympathetic activation
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.840]   after orgasm and ejaculation is thought to increase
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.120]   the exchange of pheromone orders, odors, excuse me,
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.980]   and to increase pillow talk
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.260]   and pair bonding of different kinds, okay?
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:51.440]   So that's the seesaw going back and forth
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.500]   is actually built into the process
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.100]   by which our entire species propagates.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.620]   So in some ways, every human is required
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.320]   to navigate that process
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.320]   if they want their offspring to persist.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.600]   And of course, nowadays there are technologies
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.600]   like in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.740]   There are a variety of ways that technology
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.460]   has allowed people to circumvent the actual physical mating
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.140]   process in the way that I described.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.700]   But by and large, that's the way it's done.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.900]   And certainly that's the way it was done historically
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.700]   for if not tens of thousands
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.740]   or hundreds of thousands of years.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.920]   That process is also what happens
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.000]   in all mammalian species that mate, okay?
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.640]   So I'm overlooking an entire literature of animal studies.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.740]   The classic studies of this were done by two individuals.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.740]   I'll just briefly mention them
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.980]   in case you want to look at the literature.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.420]   There's a guy at the Rockefeller University
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.880]   named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F,
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.380]   who has done beautiful studies
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.800]   identifying the neural circuitry
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.020]   of what's called the lordosis response.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:59.580]   Unlike in humans, the mating behavior of animals
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.800]   is rather stereotyped in terms of the positions
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.700]   that they occupy.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.420]   And the lordosis response is a kind of a U-shaping
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.860]   or a bending up of the hindquarters of typically of rodents
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:10.380]   but of other animals as well.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:13.640]   The male mounting is almost always from behind
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.520]   except in some species of primates.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.500]   And that lordosis response is only going to occur
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.300]   during particular phases of the estrus cycle.
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.900]   The estrus cycle is sort of the analog
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:28.180]   to the menstrual cycle, but it's not 28 days,
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.220]   it's four days or some other duration in other animals,
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.720]   depending on the animal.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.020]   The lordosis response is strongly regulated by odors,
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.100]   by contact and is estrogen and testosterone controlled.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:45.100]   And then the male portion of the mating sequence in animals,
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.740]   the mounting and thrusting and ejaculation as they're called
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.980]   or mounting, thrusting, intromission and ejaculation.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.740]   Those are the four scientific categories
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.740]   that have been described.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.220]   That's presence in rodents and also in dogs
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.420]   where it was primarily studied by Frank Beach,
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:02.540]   who was at University of California Berkeley for a long time.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.980]   And the entire literature around the neural circuitry
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.340]   for sexual and mating behavior in animals largely stemmed
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.540]   from the work of Donald Pfaff and Frank Beach
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.320]   and their scientific offspring, not their actual offspring.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.600]   You can look at that literature if you like.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.780]   There have been human neuroimaging studies
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.260]   of the process that I described a few minutes ago,
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.400]   believe it or not, of people in brain scanners,
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.300]   not necessarily mating with other people,
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.560]   but going through that arc of arousal,
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.980]   sympathetic activation during orgasm or ejaculation,
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:42.420]   and then the post ejaculatory or orgasmic phase
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.660]   in both men and women.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:46.580]   And the brain areas associated with those
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.480]   have all been mapped out now.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:54.460]   The spinal cord areas that control things like erection,
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.100]   vaginal lubrication, ejaculation, and orgasm,
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.660]   those have also been mapped out.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.180]   And this has all been explored
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.340]   from the perspective of both basic science,
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:05.160]   just to get an understanding of how our species
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.780]   has sexual interactions and reproduces,
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.380]   but also from the perspective of, for instance,
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:14.780]   trying to repair sexual function after spinal cord injury,
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:18.080]   which is a prominent concern for a lot of people,
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.740]   depending on where they have their injury,
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.820]   but in the number of people that have spinal cord injuries.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:27.340]   So this is both vital biological and clinical data.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:32.500]   The neural circuits for everything that I just described
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.560]   reside in the autonomic nervous system
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.500]   and are coordinated with the neural circuits
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.340]   that are associated with empathy.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.420]   The neural circuits for empathy, again, there are many,
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.600]   but mainly two structures that you should know about,
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.660]   the prefrontal cortex,
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.460]   which is how we perceive things outside of us
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.860]   and make decisions on the basis of those perceptions,
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.040]   how we organize those decisions,
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.500]   and an area of the brain called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.460]   The insula is a really interesting brain area
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:01.920]   that allows us to interocept to pay attention
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.080]   to what's going on inside our body
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.420]   and to split some of our attention to exterocept.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.080]   And the mating dance,
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.820]   whether or not it's the dinner and date portion
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.440]   of the mating dance or the actual physical dance part
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.640]   of the main dance or actual mating and sexual behavior,
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.240]   kissing or otherwise,
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:25.000]   that is a coordinated activity of two bodies.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.080]   Typically it's two.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.280]   I realize sometimes it's more, sometimes it's only one,
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.800]   but typically it's two bodies,
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.240]   at least in the framework we're using here.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.760]   That coordinated dance is one in which
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.400]   the autonomic nervous system of one individual
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.760]   in general is coordinating
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.880]   with the autonomic nervous system of the other individual.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.400]   And the insula is essentially splitting one's attention
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.120]   between how we feel ourselves,
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.180]   how our body feels, what we're thinking,
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:57.320]   with the thinking and the bodily sensations of the other.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.620]   And that can be communicated obviously through words.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:02.300]   It can be communicated through sounds.
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.080]   It can be communicated through touch
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.320]   and it can be communicated
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.920]   through a number of kind of more subtle cues
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.320]   like pupil size or whether or not,
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.360]   certainly in cases where we recognize the person
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.500]   and we kind of know their responses,
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.420]   their autonomic responses under different conditions,
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.620]   we can assess it.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.880]   Is the person comfortable?
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.060]   Are they uncomfortable?
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.180]   Are they more focused on me or on themselves?
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.520]   This is the coordinated silent dance
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.600]   that if we look at in neurobiological terms,
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.780]   we can really see is all about the autonomic nervous system,
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:36.020]   whether or not it's time to tip the seesaw
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.740]   to one side or the other,
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.980]   depending on whether or not the other person's seesaw
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.400]   is tilted higher or lower than the other.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.220]   Okay, so we have the autonomic nervous system
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.680]   and then we have this thing that we're calling empathy,
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.400]   which is really about autonomic matching.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.000]   And again, the insula and the prefrontal cortex
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.700]   are neural circuits that are crucial for autonomic matching
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.440]   because they allow us to say what's out there
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.740]   and do I want to match to it or not, okay?
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.400]   And then the third category of neural circuit
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.880]   that Helen Fisher and others have found to be important
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.520]   for desire, love, and attachment
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:12.280]   is the neural circuit associated with self-delusion.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.060]   What do we mean by that?
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.620]   Well, first of all,
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:20.420]   self-delusion implies a kind of cynicism
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:21.640]   about love and attachment.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.580]   And I think it was George Bernard Shaw that said,
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:27.440]   "Love is really about overestimating the differences
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.200]   between individuals."
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.960]   Actually, when I hear that and as I say it,
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.840]   I really don't like that quote.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.880]   I have no bone to pick with George Bernard Shaw,
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.280]   but what it suggests and I think what he meant
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.920]   was that in love and attachment,
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.600]   we tend to put so much value in the other
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.920]   that we forget that many of the processes
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.120]   that are going on in our brain and body
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.720]   actually could be evoked by many other people too.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.040]   But I think it somewhat overlooks
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.720]   the enormous power of attachment
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.360]   and the ways in which somebody's smell,
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.820]   somebody's voice, somebody's everything,
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.320]   or somebody's particular thing or things
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.340]   can really become so vital for our autonomic nervous system
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.980]   to feel soothed and to feel elated, et cetera.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:15.640]   So I think that while the quote is accurate
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:16.480]   in the one sense,
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.680]   I think it does overlook the neural circuits for attachment
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.140]   and just how deeply wired those can become for us.
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:25.980]   So I will balance that quote
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.820]   with an enormous number of other quotes
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.780]   that I won't mention, but that you can find out there
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:35.760]   that really point to how incredible the person is
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.260]   that one tends to be attached to,
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:41.220]   that there's really only one or several people
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.060]   that could ever exist
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.600]   that could evoke those feelings from us.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.420]   And of course you can read your Neruda poetry
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.060]   and you can find these things all over the place
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.380]   in music and poetry and writing.
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:55.020]   So for every cynical quote about these neural circuits
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.940]   being generic and could be activated by anybody,
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:02.540]   I think you'll find an ample number of opposing quotes
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:04.900]   that these neural circuits can only be activated
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.780]   by that special someone or that particular person,
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:10.020]   or maybe in just a small set of those people.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.740]   So what of delusion?
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:15.520]   Well, the work of Helen Fisher and others
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.540]   has really pointed to the fact that desire, love,
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.480]   and attachment are three separate phases
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.380]   of what we call romantic relationships
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.660]   that typically, not always,
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:29.820]   but typically desire tends to come first
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.380]   or falls in the early phase,
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:36.860]   that the process of romantic/sexual interactions,
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.720]   it doesn't necessarily have to be sex itself,
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.720]   but certainly something that involves intimacy of some kind
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.900]   and generally touch of some kind
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.260]   eventually transitions into what we call love,
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:53.020]   which eventually transitions into what we call attachment.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.060]   And I should just mention touch
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:59.600]   because touch is a fundamental aspect of this whole process.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.260]   There's an article, a research article, I should say,
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:05.820]   the title of it is "Relationship-specific encoding
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.060]   of social touch in somatosensory and insular cortices,"
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.940]   cortices being cortex, cortex is plural, cortices.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:16.100]   And again, there's our friend, the insula.
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.900]   So this is a study that explored what brain areas
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.960]   and what body areas are activated
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.740]   by specific forms of attachment and social touch.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.460]   And what they found, not surprisingly,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.500]   is that the areas of the brain
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.060]   that are associated with touch, the somatosensory areas,
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.320]   but more interestingly, the insula cortex
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.860]   are strongly activated by touch.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.060]   So touch and the amount of touching
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:43.540]   and proximity and skin contact,
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.540]   not surprisingly activates brain areas
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:48.400]   associated with somatosensory touch,
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.140]   but also the insular cortex,
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:53.660]   which again is this brain area that links the internal,
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.760]   our feelings about what's going on inside us
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.860]   and at the surface of our skin with events external.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:02.000]   And they found activation of a number of brain areas,
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.620]   the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and so on and so on.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:07.420]   That's not as essential as just understanding
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.200]   that the insula is the place in which we start
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.760]   to take our experience of our internal landscape,
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.700]   attach that to our perceptions of the external landscape,
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.080]   and then assign that a value
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.060]   or assign that some sort of interpretation.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:26.540]   And positive delusion is predictive
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.240]   of long-term attachment.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.620]   What do we mean by positive delusion?
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:32.820]   Positive delusion is the contradiction
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:34.960]   of that George Bernard Shaw quote.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.600]   It's the belief that only this person
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.580]   can make me feel this way.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:43.380]   This other person holds the capacity
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:47.700]   to make me feel this way physically or emotionally or both.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:52.700]   And so as we move from desire to love to attachment,
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.860]   our brain circuitry is literally getting tuned up
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:59.060]   such that that individual that we happen to be attached to,
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.460]   again, here thinking about monogamous relationships,
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.640]   but I guess for non-monogamous relationship be individuals,
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.260]   is and are the way in which our autonomic nervous system
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.140]   can be regulated.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.220]   They actually get access to our control panel.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.900]   So it's our autonomic nervous system, empathy,
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.540]   and this positive delusion.
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.940]   Now, positive delusion is critical.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.840]   If you look at the stability of relationships over time,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.800]   something that's been extensively studied
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.600]   mainly by psychologists, but now also by neurobiologists,
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.280]   what you find is that there are some key features
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.240]   of interactions between individuals
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.520]   that predict that a relationship will last.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.040]   And those are many,
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:46.440]   but mainly fall under this category of positive delusions.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.940]   I'll return to those and what those exactly look like,
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:51.940]   but there are also just a handful of things
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.320]   that predict that a relationship will fail over time.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.160]   This is largely the work of the Gottman's.
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.760]   It's actually a husband and wife team
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.200]   up at the University of Washington in Seattle.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.180]   The Gottman's have run a laboratory
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.020]   in the Department of Psychology for a long time.
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.860]   They've also done a lot of public facing work
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.580]   around relationships.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:15.600]   And they've talked about the various aspects
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.880]   of relationships and interactions between people
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.260]   that predict either staying together or breaking up.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:24.040]   So much so that they've established a method
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.720]   by which they can look at video interactions
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.540]   between couples and with very high degree of certainty,
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.680]   predict whether or not those couples will stay together
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.980]   or break up over time.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.480]   And they've identified what they call
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.920]   the four horsemen of relationships.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   These are things that essentially almost always predict
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.140]   that a couple will break up.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.560]   And I think the current number on this
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:52.560]   is that Gottman can predict divorce with 94% accuracy,
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.080]   which if you think about it is pretty remarkable.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.920]   So even though these are purely psychological studies,
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.480]   I'm not aware of any analysis of underlying physiology.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.160]   There are some things that they can observe
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.260]   between couples that can lead them to predict
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.760]   whether or not a couple will stay together
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.380]   or break up with 94% accuracy.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.760]   So what are those things?
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.420]   Those four behaviors, what they call
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:18.640]   the four horsemen of the apocalypse for relationships
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:24.200]   are one, criticism, two, defensiveness,
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.560]   three, stonewalling, and four, contempt,
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:31.560]   with contempt being the most powerful predictor
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.080]   of breaking up.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.400]   Criticism, of course, does not mean that there's no place
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.880]   for criticism in stable relationships.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.800]   Of course there is, it has to do with how frequent
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.100]   and how intensely that criticism is voiced.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.820]   Defensiveness, of course, is defensiveness we know
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:54.240]   as the sort of lack of ability to hear another
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.540]   or to adopt their stance.
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.740]   So lack of empathy I think is one way
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.380]   to interpret defensiveness.
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:03.220]   Stonewalling, which is actually another form
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.100]   of lack of empathy.
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.180]   It's a turning off of this neural circuit
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:09.180]   that's so critical for desire, love, and attachment.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.580]   The stonewalling essentially means the emotional response
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.500]   or the request of another is completely cut off.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.800]   So it's, I don't think there's been brain imaging of this,
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.840]   but I think we can reasonably imagine
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.060]   that it involves untethering your insular response
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.900]   from the other and what they're dealing with
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:31.440]   and focusing your insular response, no pun intended,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.200]   on your own internal state or perhaps the state
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.000]   of someone else entirely.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.400]   We'll talk about infidelity in a moment.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.560]   And then contempt.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.760]   And contempt has actually been referred to
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.280]   as the sulfuric acid of relationship.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.840]   I didn't say that, but Gottman and colleagues have,
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.200]   that it is such a powerful predictor of divorce
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.760]   and breakups in the future.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.300]   And contempt, of course, by definition is the feeling
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.840]   that a person or thing is beneath consideration,
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.820]   worthlessness, or deserving scorn.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.480]   And apparently they can identify this in the videos
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.120]   of couples having discussions and interacting
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.160]   by very elaborate eye rolls,
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.760]   by expressions of anger in one individual
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.480]   when their partner is actually expressing enthusiasm
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:16.960]   or excitement about something.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.000]   It's the, oh yeah, you would say that,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.440]   or deep-seated resentment toward the other,
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.440]   so much so that it's apparent that one kind of actively
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.240]   dislikes the other partner.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.940]   So contempt, disregard for something that should be taken
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.520]   into account is the other way to think about it.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.400]   Runs counter to all of the neural circuits,
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.700]   all three of the neural circuits
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:41.700]   that we talked about before.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:45.300]   It certainly is, it is the antithesis of empathy.
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:47.520]   It is anything but a positive delusion.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.520]   It's really looking at the other individual,
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.440]   either accurately or inaccurately,
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.800]   as somebody that you kind of despise.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.380]   And then it is an absolute inversion
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.160]   of the autonomic seesaw matching
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.800]   that I was talking about before.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.560]   It's a dissociating of your seesaw from their seesaw.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.100]   They're very excited about something,
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.900]   you're unexcited by it.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.100]   In fact, it's an inversion of their seesaw
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.700]   where they're excited, you're down.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.880]   They're down, you're up, okay?
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.600]   So it's basically an inversion of all of the neural circuits
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.700]   that Helen Fisher and others have identified as critical
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.420]   for desire, love, and attachment.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.240]   And therefore it's not surprising
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.460]   that it is so strongly predictive of breakups
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:32.080]   and in the case of married couples of divorce.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.480]   For those of you that are interested
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:37.000]   in the work of the Gottman's and similar work,
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.180]   they've written several popular books.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.800]   They're fairly easy to find.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.980]   We can link to one of those in the caption,
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.960]   but they've also developed
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.460]   some quite interesting online resources
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:50.460]   in their so-called love lab.
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.240]   I guess it's fortunate that they didn't call it
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.400]   the hate lab or the breakup lab
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.900]   'cause they focused a lot on what predicts breakups,
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.320]   but they've also written extensively
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:02.500]   and researched extensively in peer-reviewed studies
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:08.160]   what makes people find appropriate partners for them
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.440]   and to maintain those partnerships over time.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.040]   So you can go, you can search for love lab,
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.160]   University of Washington, Gottman,
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.340]   or any number of their various books.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:22.120]   I think you'll find some useful resources there.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:27.140]   I want to shift back to the work of Helen Fisher.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:31.120]   She's made some very interesting statements
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.280]   and some very interesting observations
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.820]   that at least to my mind map very well
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.560]   onto the knowledge of neural circuitry,
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.520]   both in humans and in non-human primates
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.600]   and in other species.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.640]   I realized that she's not the only name in the game,
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.760]   but she's made some observations that I think are very,
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.040]   as we say, parsimonious,
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.660]   meaning they allow us to organize a lot of this stuff
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.800]   into some distinct frameworks.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   She's also done some really beautiful studies
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.740]   that involve data from millions
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:04.000]   or even tens of millions of individuals on dating sites.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.720]   So I'm going to share those with you in a moment.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.120]   But before I do that,
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.640]   I just want to paraphrase Dr. Fisher,
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.960]   who said that sex drive or desire,
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.040]   the pursuit of someone to mate with,
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:22.300]   meaning to mate the verb, not necessarily to find a mate,
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.520]   may be, she didn't say definitively,
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.380]   but maybe a way to forage for potential love partners.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:32.480]   That the arc of this whole business
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.540]   is really the order that we're describing it,
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:39.360]   that it's desire, then love, and then attachment.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.060]   And that oftentimes people can get confused.
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.640]   You may know some of these people,
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.700]   you may be one of these individuals
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.480]   who might confuse desire for attachment
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:53.780]   or might confuse love for attachment,
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:56.740]   but that there's a sequence of recruitment
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:59.580]   of these neural circuits that's established first
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.400]   from the pursuit of someone to mate with.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.020]   And she's placed this in the context
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.260]   of kind of more modern dating themes
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:09.860]   where depending on culture,
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:14.860]   people might explore several, maybe many, many individuals
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:18.720]   before quote-unquote settling down with somebody,
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.060]   at least for some period of time.
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.440]   I think that's an interesting framework
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.380]   because it circumvents a lot of the, frankly,
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:31.540]   unanswerable questions about whether or not, you know,
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.120]   humans were meant to be monogamous
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.180]   or whether or not they weren't.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.060]   Those are conversations that hold cultural context,
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:39.740]   that hold all sorts of contexts
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:42.700]   that really can't be addressed in a laboratory setting.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.720]   But this idea that sex drive is a way to forage
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.380]   for potential love partners and that love
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:52.540]   is a kind of a litmus test for whether or not longer
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:55.860]   or term or deeper attachments can and will form
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.340]   is one that at least makes sense to me.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:23:59.180]   Later in the episode,
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:02.740]   we'll talk about this notion of sex drive and desire.
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.980]   I'll actually talk about some tools
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.960]   that have very strong data really to support them
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.340]   in terms of things that people can do or take
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.440]   to increase libido, both men and women,
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:17.320]   because there's actually quite good data on that now.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.440]   But in the meantime, I want to talk about some of the work
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:24.600]   that Dr. Fisher has done in terms of categorizing people
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.120]   into, again, we have four groups.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.240]   These are distinct from the A, B, C, and D
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.180]   attachment styles described earlier,
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.620]   although as I described them,
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:36.520]   you might be able to map them somewhat onto those.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:41.440]   And these four groups are groups that were defined
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.940]   through her studies of people that were or are,
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:49.560]   I don't know if they were or if they are still on match.com,
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.600]   but a very extensive data set.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:55.120]   So again, millions, if not tens of millions of individuals,
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.640]   the number I heard her quote,
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.220]   and forgive me if this is not accurate,
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:02.580]   is that in upwards of 40 million individuals
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:06.800]   in terms of whether or not their neurochemical
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.780]   and hormone systems are tuned
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:11.860]   toward particular types of behaviors.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.280]   What do I mean by that?
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.180]   Well, both men and women, males and females,
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.260]   have both testosterone and estrogen.
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:21.480]   Typically, again, these are averages,
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.300]   but typically men have more testosterone
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.620]   than they do estrogen,
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.860]   and they have more testosterone than do women
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.600]   and less estrogen than do women.
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.620]   Typically women have more estrogen
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:33.160]   than they do testosterone, again, averages,
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:38.220]   and they have less testosterone than men,
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.860]   more estrogen than men, and so on and so forth.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.920]   But both hormone systems are active
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.100]   in both sets of individuals.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:50.260]   And of course, all humans, as far as we know,
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.020]   manufacture both dopamine and serotonin.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.400]   Dopamine, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.300]   has a number of effects in the brain and body,
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.400]   but one of the primary effects is that it places us
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.340]   into states of motivation and pursuit for various things.
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:06.120]   There is a somewhat close relationship
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:10.480]   between the dopamine system and the testosterone system
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.760]   in the hypothalamus,
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.320]   this brain area above the roof of your mouth,
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.660]   and the pituitary gland,
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:17.040]   which is responsible for making hormones
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.100]   that make the ovaries and/or testes
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:24.100]   secrete testosterone or estrogen.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:26.540]   So there's a lot of signaling that occurs
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.940]   such that dopamine and testosterone tend to operate
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:33.360]   as kind of close cousins in a system of pursuit.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.660]   And conversely, the serotonin system tends to,
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.660]   on average, collaborate with the estrogen system
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:43.420]   to impart certain physiological functions and behaviors.
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:48.380]   So these aren't hard and fast, or I guess better stated,
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:51.420]   these aren't strict black and white categorizations,
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.480]   but I think those general themes hold
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:56.460]   when you look at the animal and human data.
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:00.500]   So Dr. Fisher has taken some liberties,
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.580]   but I think they are what I would call
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:04.160]   logically and scientifically
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.780]   and neurobiologically grounded liberties
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:10.520]   in classifying individuals who are on these dating sites
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.960]   according to the types of things they report
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.100]   about themselves and the type of people
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:19.060]   they tend to match with on these dating sites
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:22.580]   and created these four categories.
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.500]   The four categories are,
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.740]   she calls one the dopamine category.
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:30.420]   So these are people who would have high dopamine.
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:33.940]   And again, that's just a name.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:36.760]   It doesn't mean they have low anything else,
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.460]   but they are high on the dopamine scale.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.580]   People who rate high on the dopamine scale
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:44.860]   tend to be what the scientists and psychologists
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.060]   call high sensation seeking, novel seeking.
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:49.800]   They like new things, they like spontaneity,
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.300]   they tend to be very adventurous.
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:52.900]   And I think that's largely true.
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:55.060]   If you look at conditions
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:59.460]   where dopamine is super physiological,
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:04.460]   it's elevated beyond abnormal levels, things like mania,
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.360]   or when people take certain drugs of abuse
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.660]   like cocaine or amphetamine
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:12.500]   that really raise dopamine levels up very, very high
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:13.780]   for some period of time,
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:17.100]   they do tend to increase energy motivation
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:18.060]   and novelty seeking.
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:20.060]   And of course, drugs like amphetamine and cocaine
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.120]   have all sorts of deleterious effects
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.160]   that I don't need to go into here,
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.860]   but it's worth pointing out.
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:27.260]   But they don't tend to make people calm and relaxed
[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:30.700]   and seek soothing interactions.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:34.100]   Conversely, the group that Dr. Fisher calls
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.540]   the serotonin group,
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:41.540]   tend to be more grounded in soothing activities,
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:43.400]   quiescent type activities.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.580]   They actually tend to be on average,
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.760]   they tend to like rules and follow rules.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.180]   They tend to be home bodies, this sort of thing.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:51.820]   They're really, you can imagine them
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:54.980]   the sort of stable types, but they really like stability.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.280]   They're not really into spontaneity as much,
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.260]   again, averages.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.380]   And then she created two other categories,
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:04.580]   the testosterone category of high testosterone.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:07.620]   This again could be males or females.
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:11.000]   And then the estrogen category again
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.080]   could be males or females.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.500]   And she gave these different names
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.700]   that I won't go into here.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:16.980]   You can look up her work online,
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:18.860]   but she, you know, names like the director
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.940]   and the follower and things like that.
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.160]   But I don't really want to use those
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.620]   as much as I want to stick to the biological terms.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:28.420]   So we have dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:31.460]   Now that might seem like an unfair
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.620]   kind of overgeneralization,
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:36.860]   but what's interesting is not necessarily the name
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:38.600]   or the neurochemical system, right?
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.300]   Those could have just been called category one, two, three,
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:45.280]   and four for all that matters here.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.540]   What is interesting is seeing how those different groups
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:53.260]   of individuals that she absolutely can categorize
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:57.100]   based on their self-reported preferences
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.920]   about behaviors and certain kinds of interactions,
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.300]   how those groups tend to pair up
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:05.380]   with people in the same or opposite categories.
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.960]   So what her studies reveal is that people
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.980]   that fall into the high sensation seeking,
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:12.340]   novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.780]   the one that she calls the high dopamine category,
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:19.000]   tend to pair up with, at least in the short term,
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.020]   tend to pair up with people who are also
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.700]   in that dopaminergic category.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.940]   So these would be people that would spontaneously
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.980]   take a trip or explore something new or a new restaurant.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:34.460]   They tend to be creative and explorative types.
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:39.460]   So that group on average tends to date and mate
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:42.900]   and potentially form long-term relationships
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:46.020]   within category, again, averages.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.900]   Individuals that she placed into the serotonin group
[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:52.920]   or what she hypothesized would be a high serotonin group,
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.780]   again, they didn't measure serotonin,
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:58.460]   but people that tend to place value on stability,
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:02.300]   on rules, on certain forms of kind of traditional
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:05.540]   organization at home and in relationships,
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:10.540]   those people also tended to pair up with select, date,
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:14.680]   we presume mate with, and form stable relationships
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.240]   with people in the same category.
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.740]   Now, individuals in the other two categories,
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.980]   the high testosterone group, and again,
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.480]   testosterone wasn't measured,
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.540]   but she called it the high testosterone group,
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:30.540]   but these are people that tend to be very directive.
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:32.340]   They tend to know what they want
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:35.540]   and are comfortable telling other people what they want
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:40.540]   and from them, these are individuals that in her studies
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:44.200]   and in other studies tend to be a little bit challenging,
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:47.200]   meaning they not necessarily challenging to be around,
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.180]   but they tend to challenge other people,
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:52.740]   kind of push them in order to expand their boundaries,
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:55.860]   either for sake of the relationship or just in general.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:57.580]   And the people they tend to push are the people
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:59.200]   that they pair up with,
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.260]   which are the people in the estrogen category,
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.300]   what she called high estrogen.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.800]   Again, they didn't measure estrogen,
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:07.600]   but the people in the estrogen category were the ones
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.860]   that describe themselves and their choices in life
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.460]   and their preferences as being nurturing.
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:16.040]   They actually seem to like it when someone else
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.760]   is making the major decisions, not every decision.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.120]   They certainly like to be heard, of course,
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.120]   in terms of their preferences, but that those two types,
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.280]   the, what she called the testosterone
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.800]   and the estrogen type tend to pair up.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.520]   So why are these categorizations
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.600]   and these averages interesting to me,
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.260]   at least interesting enough to convey to you?
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.900]   The reason they're interesting to me is,
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.460]   again, not because of their names,
[01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:43.240]   these molecules were not measured in these individuals,
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.500]   but that they once again bring us to the themes
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.140]   that we addressed before,
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.880]   which are the autonomic nervous system
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.760]   and whether or not it tends to be shifted
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.860]   more towards alertness in action
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.520]   or more towards kind of a stable equilibrium
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.580]   or more towards kind of calm
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:03.520]   and whether or not individuals are selecting
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.200]   for people who have autonomic nervous systems
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.920]   that are more or less like theirs
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.740]   before they even meet, right?
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:13.920]   So again, going back to this seesaw analogy,
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.640]   it's almost like people who have the kind of flat seesaw,
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.600]   alert but calm, but not extremely alert,
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:23.940]   not extremely overly calm in situations,
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.780]   but kind of in the middle seem to be seeking out people
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:31.340]   that are also at that kind of autonomic equilibrium.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.740]   People in the, what she called the dopamine category,
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:35.100]   which really can just be described
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.300]   as high sensation seeking, novelty seeking,
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.040]   they seem to want to pair with one another.
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:42.520]   So there's a selection for similar
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.680]   in two of the groups, autonomic tone.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.380]   I find that very interesting because in that decision
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:53.400]   or that preference for similar autonomic tone,
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:58.300]   it essentially eliminates a lot of the requirement
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:01.960]   for figuring out how to match
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.680]   one's autonomic nervous system to another.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.580]   They simply find someone with a similar tendency, okay?
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:10.120]   Whereas in the other two groups
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.720]   that she called testosterone and estrogen,
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.540]   the director type and the nurturing
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:16.240]   kind of somewhat follower type,
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.980]   there's an establishment of balance,
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:23.980]   but not between two individuals as a match,
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.920]   but rather on the whole in the relationship.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.420]   One person is kind of driving the novelty seeking
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.960]   in the course of decisions and actions,
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.800]   and the other person is essentially agreeing to those.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:37.420]   Now, assuming that those decisions are good for both people.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:39.200]   And I emphasize good for both people
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.880]   because one of the themes that Dr. Fisher underscores
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.040]   that I'd like to underscore here as well
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.780]   is that it need not be the case that people pair up
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:51.000]   exactly according to these categorizations
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.680]   that I've described.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.960]   Dopamine with dopamine, serotonin with serotonin,
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:57.720]   testosterone with estrogen and so on.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.920]   What is important is that there be a recognition
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.760]   and a respect for the other types
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:06.320]   or a recognition and a respect for the fact
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.160]   that both are of the same type.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.880]   You could actually imagine, for instance,
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.500]   that two people of this high sensation seeking,
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.400]   novelty seeking could have a terrifically
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:16.520]   exciting relationship,
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.740]   but that it actually might be a relationship
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:23.620]   in which the financial stability isn't quite there
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:27.000]   or in which the basic stability isn't there.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.120]   You could imagine, for instance,
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.900]   a situation in which a relationship between two people
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:37.180]   of what she called the high serotonin preference
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:39.620]   would have a relationship that was actually kind of dull
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:41.760]   in which both of them found themselves kind of bored
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:45.100]   at some point or in which there wasn't enough
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:49.080]   of the dynamic tension that sometimes is required
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.540]   in order to keep this cycle of desire,
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:52.540]   love and attachment going,
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:55.020]   something that we will talk about in a moment.
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:59.900]   So the point here is not that one should necessarily pair up
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:02.900]   according to these arrangements that I described.
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:06.600]   The point is that on average, that's what tends to happen
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:09.280]   and that through a recognition
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.760]   that these categorizations exist,
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.760]   similar to the recognition that the type A, B, C, and D
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.940]   infant and toddler type attachments exist,
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:23.640]   that we can gain better self-awareness of who we are
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.800]   and how we tend to show up in romantic attachments
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.800]   and thereby navigate healthier mate-seeking,
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:36.380]   healthier breakups, if the case dictates it,
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:39.340]   and in some cases, healthy long-term relationships
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:41.280]   by understanding that the other person
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.680]   can either be similar or complimentary to us.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:47.060]   One is neither better than the other.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:50.680]   It's simply the case that in all romantic attachments,
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.540]   from the initial inception of that romantic attachment,
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:58.080]   desire, love and attachment,
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:01.020]   there is an autonomic coordination.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:02.820]   And of course there's coordination
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:06.580]   of all sorts of other things like food, sex and sleep
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:09.260]   and finances and where people are going to live
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.620]   and many other features.
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.580]   But that at the core of all that
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:16.820]   is a seeking of either autonomic likeness
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:19.100]   or autonomic differences.
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:22.660]   And I think that recognition can be extremely valuable
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:27.060]   in thinking about tools to enter and maintain relationships.
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:30.400]   If one thinks about their autonomic nervous system,
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:34.380]   not simply as something that is driven by external people
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:37.940]   and events, but that we can actually gain some control over
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:40.420]   through techniques of the sort that I talked about earlier
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:43.160]   and on previous podcasts, but also generally,
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.780]   if we are able to adjust our autonomic nervous system
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:50.720]   in order to at least appreciate or get some empathy
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.120]   into what someone else is experiencing,
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.380]   then we gain actual cognitive empathy.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:00.100]   And this episode isn't about empathy per se,
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.900]   but the theme keeps coming up again and again.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:03.380]   And I think it's worth mentioning
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:06.140]   that when you talk to psychologists,
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:07.500]   whether or not they're psychoanalysts
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.980]   or from another source of training,
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:12.300]   what you find is that they don't talk about empathy
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:16.620]   as a general term, they will talk about emotional empathy.
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:18.260]   They'll talk about cognitive empathy.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:19.900]   And what I'm talking about here today
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.600]   is that yet a third category
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.780]   that is very strongly determinant of relationship dynamics,
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.920]   and that's autonomic empathy.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:30.580]   I'm a biologist, I'm not a psychologist,
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:32.300]   so I love mechanism.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:35.660]   And fortunately, there are studies that have been done
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:37.840]   recently using modern techniques
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.600]   to look at neural mechanisms of romantic attachment.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.760]   I mentioned earlier some of the brain imaging studies
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.380]   that have been done on child and mother,
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.240]   literally imaging the activity of neurons in the brain
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.960]   as child is nursing or as a mother is soothing baby.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.540]   And as you learned earlier,
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:59.260]   baby is soothing mother as well.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:00.400]   Those are remarkable studies.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.100]   You may have seen some of these pictures online.
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.540]   You can see the kind of silhouette of the infant and mother
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.340]   and their brains and even some of the brain activation
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:09.580]   patterns, really, really beautiful studies.
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:13.900]   Similar studies have been done in romantic couples
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:17.140]   with those couples either touching one another,
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:20.360]   touching and kissing or in kind of clever,
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.520]   I think control experiments of the person
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.420]   just touching a pillow or something or kissing a pillow
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:30.460]   in order to try and create the most reasonable control
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:32.700]   for what are actually pretty complicated
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.620]   interpersonal dynamics to do in a brain imaging scanner.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:40.020]   But some of the other studies that have been done recently
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.540]   involved so-called EEG.
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:42.920]   So these are electrical recordings
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.900]   that are done noninvasively,
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:47.540]   putting a bunch of electrodes on the outside of the scalp.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:52.300]   EEG is useful in that you can do it noninvasively.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:56.340]   You can do it while people are moving and doing things,
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:58.800]   kissing, touching, et cetera.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.120]   It doesn't allow one to image or to evaluate neural activity
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.600]   very deeply in the brain.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.360]   So you can miss out on a lot of things.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.900]   It's sort of like looking at the wave structure on the ocean
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:12.280]   without actually looking into the depths of the ocean.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.600]   So you can miss certain things,
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.980]   but if you see things, generally you trust they are there,
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:18.620]   but you can't see what you don't see.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:21.060]   Nonetheless, there are some studies
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.940]   that I'll just point you to,
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.660]   and that form the segue
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:27.380]   for what I'm going to discuss in a moment,
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:32.380]   which is a study published in Scientific Reports in 2021,
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:35.240]   entitled "Investigating Real-Life Emotions
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:37.940]   in Romantic Couples, a Mobile EEG Study."
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:41.220]   So this is, as the title suggests,
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:43.760]   I think people wear these EEG caps of electrodes,
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.920]   get engaged in very passionate emotional kisses,
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.520]   emotional speech toward one another,
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.680]   standing at different distances.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.560]   So a lot of cool stuff that you can do
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.840]   that you really couldn't do in a brain scanner,
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:56.840]   because in a brain scanner,
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.920]   people have to be there, usually in a bite bar,
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.400]   they're actually jaw hooks like this.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.380]   I've been in one of these things.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:04.320]   There's not a lot of moving around to be had,
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:07.040]   at least not using the current technology.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.480]   In any case, what they found was
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.200]   there is a shift in brain waves, brain states,
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.480]   things like alpha waves,
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.300]   which is a particular frequency of brain waves
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:20.060]   in the neocortex, the kind of outer shell of the brain
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:22.160]   just beneath the skull.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:25.600]   And in people that are kissing
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.700]   or in people that are engaged in romantic speech,
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:31.740]   or I didn't actually hear what they said to one another,
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.500]   but what the couple seems exciting,
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.740]   romantic, and arousing to them,
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.640]   they see more alpha wave activity
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.280]   compared to the control conditions.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.660]   And there was some what we call lateralization
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:44.720]   where the left hemisphere was more active than the right
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.560]   and so forth.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:48.800]   And these studies are important
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.260]   because we know that the autonomic nervous systems
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:56.040]   of individuals tend to start to collaborate
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.280]   and actually synchronize at the level of heartbeats,
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.200]   at the level of breathing
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.560]   during romantic interactions of different kinds.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.920]   But these studies are some of the first of their kind
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.140]   to start looking at neural synchronization
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:09.900]   between individuals.
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:14.220]   Now, the simple version of looking at this
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:16.760]   and the way I would have thought this would all go
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.740]   was, okay, two people start kissing,
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:20.540]   they start talking about what they find
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:22.380]   particularly romantic and arousing for them,
[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.800]   and their brainwaves will just match to one another.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:28.560]   And that's really the basis of romantic attachment
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:32.260]   and romantic engagement in that sort of thing.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:36.280]   But it turns out that the opposite is true.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.800]   So a really nice study published in a really fine journal,
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.160]   Cerebral Cortex is a journal
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:43.600]   that I've known about for many years.
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.720]   They published Strong Anatomy, Physiology, and Neuroimaging.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.940]   There's a study that was published,
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:52.540]   first author Kajimura in,
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:56.940]   and this paper really points, again, this is 2021.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.580]   And the title of this paper is,
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:01.000]   "Brain knows who is on the same wavelength.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.920]   "Resting state connectivity can predict compatibility
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.380]   "of female-male relationship."
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.800]   Now, what this study did was a little bit different.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.100]   They looked at the resting
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:12.860]   or default mode activity of the brain.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:15.860]   So rather than evoked activity, as it's called,
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:16.960]   where people are kissing
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.400]   or are engaged in some sort of activity,
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.100]   this was a neuroimaging study, not EEG,
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:25.780]   but fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging,
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.160]   which is similar to EEG in principle,
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.360]   but allows you to look deep into the brain.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.460]   And it has a very good resolution in time and space.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.780]   So fast events can be monitored,
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:42.100]   and the precise location of those events can be monitored
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.740]   somewhat better than EEG, and there are exceptions to this.
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.360]   So for you EEGers out there,
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:50.340]   EEG, don't come after me with electrodes.
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:54.160]   Just understand that fMRI gives you a fuller picture
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.080]   of what's going on.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:58.060]   And what Kajimura et al found was that,
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:03.840]   contrary to what your reflexive prediction might be,
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:09.980]   people tend to select people that have resting brain states
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:11.940]   that are different than theirs,
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:15.200]   or sometimes they found that are actually opposite
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.260]   to their own resting brain state.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.220]   And you might say, "Well, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:22.240]   "I thought this is all about autonomic coordination."
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.540]   But actually, if we go back
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:27.280]   to Helen Fisher's categorizations of the dopamine types,
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.420]   the sensation-seeking types, that is serotonin,
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:33.180]   the kind of stable rule-following types,
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.480]   testosterone and estrogen types,
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.420]   remember that the two categories
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:38.140]   that she called testosterone and estrogen type,
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:40.700]   the director and the follower, the nurturer,
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:42.140]   I guess it would be the more accurate way,
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:43.900]   the director and the nurturer,
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:48.420]   those tend to pair up across categories, not within category.
[01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:51.420]   And so I think what's really needed for this field,
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:53.660]   which to my knowledge hasn't happened yet,
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:58.000]   is to really start to map the neuroanatomical
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.120]   and neurophysiological findings of, in this case,
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:06.120]   that resting brain state is in one form, in one individual,
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:09.260]   and they tend to seek out people whose resting brain state
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:11.880]   is different than theirs, not similar.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.080]   That needs to be mapped
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:18.040]   onto the more subjective psychological categorizations
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:20.400]   that Helen Fisher and indeed the Gottmans
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:21.980]   and others have created.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.000]   That's sort of the state of the field now.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.380]   And I mentioned this, not to confuse you,
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:28.600]   but to the contrary, to illustrate
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:32.060]   that it's not just about finding someone just like you,
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.400]   and it's not just about finding someone
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:35.880]   who's opposite to you.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.560]   This is actually the reason that I decided
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.240]   to become a biologist at some point in my life,
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:43.920]   which is that we can find verbal sayings and stories
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.880]   and examples to support just about anything.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.140]   This is not a knock on the field of psychology,
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:50.820]   as you can probably tell from today's episode,
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:52.560]   I have great respect for and reverence
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.640]   for the field of psychology,
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.720]   especially its collaboration with neuroscience
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:58.060]   and vice versa.
[01:45:58.060 --> 01:46:02.040]   But in the popular culture, we can find examples
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.440]   and sayings that support essentially anything
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.380]   as it relates to a relationship.
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:08.880]   For instance, I've heard, and you've probably heard,
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.840]   absence makes the heart grow fonder,
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:13.920]   and indeed I've experienced that, and I believe it's true.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:16.380]   But I also have experienced, and I believe to be true,
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:18.800]   that out of sight, out of mind also exists
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.640]   and that there will be a biological mechanism for that.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:24.760]   The point here is that matching of same to same
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.260]   or same to different can both be effective
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:32.260]   in creating the desire-love attachment process.
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:36.140]   It's a matter of who is looking for same
[01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:37.360]   and who is looking for different.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.120]   And there, I think Dr. Fisher and the work
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:42.680]   of these neurophysiologists and brain imagers
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.220]   really does point in a direction whereby
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:48.920]   there is not one form of attachment
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:51.060]   that is going to be wholly above all else
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:53.080]   and will predict good outcomes.
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:56.500]   There is not going to be a case in which opposites attract,
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:58.820]   and that's always the best rule to follow.
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:01.280]   Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:03.280]   There is also not the case that people tend
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.300]   to pair up with similar.
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:08.100]   Sometimes it will be the case, sometimes it won't.
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:10.040]   Now, there are certain statistics
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.300]   that support that statement.
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.660]   For instance, people, on average,
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.840]   people pair up with individuals
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.280]   of similar educational background, income,
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.120]   and attractiveness.
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:22.380]   That is true on average, but it's not always the case.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.140]   And again, a knowledge of and a respect
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:27.740]   for the different categorizations of attachment,
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:30.160]   the different categorizations of mate-seeking,
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.580]   described by Fisher and others,
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:33.560]   and the recognition that matching
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.760]   of autonomic nervous systems,
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.560]   but also mismatching of resting state brain networks
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.600]   are all at play in driving what we are calling
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.440]   desire, love, and attachment.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.480]   So in keeping with the exploration of the fact
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.460]   that there's a saying, or a book, or a song,
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.280]   or an example of pretty much any relationship dynamic,
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:55.200]   I want to now talk about an article that came out
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:58.660]   a little over 10 years ago that talked about
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:02.800]   the universality of love and the ability to fall in love.
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.120]   So this would be very much in line
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.560]   with the George Bernard Shaw quote that I mentioned earlier,
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.600]   that love is really overestimating the differences
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.600]   between individuals.
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.020]   And again, I should say that is not something
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:13.680]   that I personally believe,
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.600]   although maybe I'm just deluding myself.
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.680]   I like to think that the people that we fall in love with
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:21.940]   are really special for us,
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:25.580]   that they could not easily be replaced with anybody else.
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:26.960]   That's simply my stance.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:28.740]   I'm not basing that on any
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:31.580]   hardcore neurobiological mechanism.
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:35.200]   But nonetheless, an article was published
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.620]   in the New York Times in 2015
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:41.880]   that related to some psychological studies
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.620]   that were done, as well as some clinical work,
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:47.460]   as well as some, what I would call pop psychology
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:50.680]   or things that fall outside the domains of academic science.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:54.720]   And the whole basis of this article
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:58.940]   was 36 questions that lead to love.
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:02.900]   And it involved a listing out, indeed, of 36 questions,
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.020]   a set divided into set one, set two, and set three,
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:09.880]   that progress from somewhat ordinary questions
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:12.800]   about life experience and self-report
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.920]   to more, let's call them deep questions
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:18.120]   about people's values
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:20.200]   and things that are emotionally close to them.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.960]   And I'll just give an example of a few of these.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.280]   You can find this easily online
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:25.700]   by just putting into your search engine
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.920]   36 questions that lead to love.
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.680]   Some of the questions in set number one were, for instance,
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:34.000]   what would constitute a perfect day for you?
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.080]   For what in your life do you feel most grateful,
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.640]   kind of standard questionnaire stuff.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:41.920]   In set two, what is your most treasured memory?
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.380]   What is your most terrible memory?
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:44.860]   So these are, as you can tell,
[01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:45.980]   are drilling a little bit deeper
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:49.240]   into one's personal experience and emotional system.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:54.240]   And then set three, questions 25 through 36,
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:59.540]   are things, what is a very embarrassing moment in your life?
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:03.240]   When did you last cry in front of another person
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:04.920]   and by yourself?
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.060]   What is something that's too serious to be joked about?
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:10.980]   So it's going deeper into one's emotional system.
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:13.760]   And even questions like of all the people in your family,
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.660]   whose death would you find most disturbing and why?
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:19.160]   So pretty heavy stuff there at the end.
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:21.720]   Now, the reason this article got so much traction
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:22.920]   and the reason I'm bringing it up today
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.200]   is that there was a statement
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.160]   that was made in and around this article
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:32.360]   that if two people went on a date
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:36.480]   or simply sat down and asked each other these questions
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.420]   and each answered these questions
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:43.200]   and the other was paying attention carefully
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:48.080]   and at some level, emotionally responding or not responding,
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.240]   but certainly paying attention
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.140]   to the answers of the other person,
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.980]   that by the end of that exchange
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:56.740]   where one person asks 36 questions
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.560]   and the other person answers all 36,
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:01.280]   and then the other person asks all 36
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.340]   and the other person answers all 36,
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:05.620]   that they would fall in love, right?
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:08.140]   Which seems like kind of a ridiculous thing.
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.820]   And yet it is the case
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:13.900]   that people who go through this exercise
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:17.620]   report feeling as if they know the other person quite well
[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:21.260]   and feeling certain levels of attachment
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.780]   or even love and desire for the other person
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:27.200]   that they would not have predicted, excuse me,
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:29.200]   would not have predicted
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.180]   had they not gone through that process.
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:33.760]   So what's going on in this exchange of questions and answers
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.540]   of a progressively more emotional and deep level?
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.020]   Well, what I predict is going on
[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:43.060]   is that inside of that exchange,
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:46.100]   people are creating a sort of delusional story
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:48.180]   about the nature of the exchange
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:51.260]   being a reflection of some deeper attachment.
[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:53.960]   And so even though people are just exchanging words,
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.540]   they're not physically touching,
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:58.220]   they are not, at least not at the point
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:02.520]   where they're running these kinds of questionnaire studies,
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:05.380]   they may touch afterwards for all I know
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:07.320]   and probably did in some cases,
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.740]   but they're not exchanging life experience
[01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:11.320]   in an immediate way.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.080]   They're not actually going off into the world
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.020]   and doing things together yet.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:17.780]   They are simply exchanging narrative.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:21.220]   But we know based on recent studies,
[01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:23.460]   and I've covered this before on this podcast,
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:24.280]   but I'll mention again,
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:27.220]   there was a study published in Cell Reports,
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:29.360]   a cell press journal, excellent journal,
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:33.900]   showing that when individuals listen to the same narrative,
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:35.560]   their heart rates tend to synchronize
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.780]   or at least follow a very similar pattern,
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:39.500]   even if they're not in the same room
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.100]   listening to a given narrative.
[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:44.180]   Whereas in this case, people are facing one another,
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:46.660]   listening to the narratives of each other,
[01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:49.940]   certainly they are having autonomic responses.
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.500]   And it stands to reason
[01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:54.140]   that their autonomic nervous systems are synchronizing
[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:56.660]   much in the same way that the Cell Reports study found
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:59.880]   that people will synchronize their autonomic nervous systems
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:03.800]   to a shared heard story from another.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.240]   In other words, whether or not we hear a story,
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:08.480]   watch a movie, listen to a song,
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.280]   or exchange our own individual stories,
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.560]   our autonomic nervous systems have the potential
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:15.000]   to map onto one another.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.160]   So I'm not all that surprised
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.840]   that people find that they fall in love, in quotes,
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:24.200]   after answering these questions to one another,
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.820]   because essentially the way these questions are laid out
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:28.940]   is they establish a narrative,
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:30.900]   they establish a very personal narrative,
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.800]   and the other person is listening very closely.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:35.940]   And we don't have physiological or brain imaging studies
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:38.640]   to support what I'm about to say,
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.600]   but the reasonable interpretation
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:42.900]   is that that's causing
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:45.420]   some sort of autonomic synchronization.
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:47.460]   So if you want to try this on a date,
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:50.340]   or even it's actually been hypothesized
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.640]   that this could be useful for existing couples,
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:54.940]   even if they already know the answers
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:55.940]   to some of these questions,
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:57.740]   and that doesn't surprise me either.
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:53:59.240]   I think that autonomic coordination
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:02.380]   is present during mating behavior,
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:05.880]   it's present during shared experience of the outside world,
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:08.760]   movies, concerts, watching one's children
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.320]   with somebody else, et cetera,
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.400]   and it's established by sharing one's own narrative
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.140]   of their own personal experience.
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:17.380]   So I don't want to seem overly reductionist.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:21.500]   I'll never propose that all of our sensation, perception,
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:22.860]   action, and experience in life
[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:26.300]   boils down to us just being bags of chemicals
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:28.020]   and the action of those chemicals
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:29.620]   or any aspect of our nervous system.
[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:34.540]   And yet in looking across the psychological literature
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:36.140]   of development of attachment,
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:37.820]   in the psychological literature
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.060]   of adult and romantic attachment,
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:43.360]   and what makes and breaks those attachments,
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.940]   it's very clear to me,
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.060]   and I think courses through the literature
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:48.380]   at multiple levels,
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:52.360]   that autonomic coordination is absolutely key
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:55.620]   for the establishment of desire, love, and attachment.
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:58.540]   In fact, I talked earlier about how our actual conception
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:00.820]   is born out of autonomic coordination
[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:02.540]   of one sort or another.
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:05.580]   So again, it doesn't necessarily mean
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:08.600]   that autonomic nervous systems always be synchronized.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.340]   In the case of the two categorizations
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:14.340]   that Fisher proposed of the director/testosterone type
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:19.340]   and the nurturing follower/estrogen type,
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:22.440]   it was actually the coordination,
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:25.920]   but in opposite directions of individuals
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:27.280]   that fall into each of those categories
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:29.000]   that led to more stable attachments
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.800]   or the seeking out of those attachments, as you'd say.
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:34.580]   But nonetheless, it's, at least to my mind,
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:37.140]   very clear that autonomic coordination
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:41.420]   is a hallmark feature of desire,
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:44.200]   a hallmark feature of what we call love,
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.080]   and a hallmark feature of what we call attachment,
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.500]   and that the breaking of attachments
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:53.920]   or the failures of desire, the failures of love,
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.700]   and the failures of attachment over time
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.620]   in line with the work of Gottman and others,
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:02.520]   and even just simply what's required for mating behavior
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:05.660]   is also reflected in the autonomic nervous system,
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:06.500]   but in that case,
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:09.020]   a failure to coordinate the autonomic nervous systems
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:11.340]   in some sort of concerted way.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:14.200]   Any discussion about desire, love, and attachment
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:17.580]   would be incomplete if we didn't talk about
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:20.240]   the dreaded infidelity and cheating.
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.320]   You know, much has been made of infidelity and cheating,
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.720]   and whether or not people who are higher on dopamine
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:27.380]   and sensation seeking tend to cheat more or less.
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:30.680]   Frankly, I don't think there's any solid evidence for that.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:33.960]   I think there are a lot of examples that we can draw from
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:36.780]   in our own lives and in the lives of others
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:39.560]   that would generally support one or the other model,
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:43.380]   but I'm not aware of any decent physiological studies
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:46.240]   or psychological studies that really point to that.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:49.220]   For instance, I would never say that
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.780]   the serotonergic phenotype as described by Fisher
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:57.000]   is less prone to cheat or that the, you know,
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.600]   people who have an insecure attachment
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:01.980]   are more likely to cheat, for instance.
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.420]   I don't think those correlations have been drawn
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:05.840]   in any kind of meaningful way yet,
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:09.300]   so I would be cautious about assigning them
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.360]   without that evidence.
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.600]   However, there are some interesting studies involving,
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:18.880]   again, neuroimaging and some subjective measures in humans,
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:21.980]   meaning asking them questions that they're good ways
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:25.520]   to tease out lies from truths in these sorts of studies,
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:30.280]   and whether or not people tend to find their partner
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.460]   or others more or less attractive,
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:36.760]   depending on how people feel about themselves.
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:39.440]   And I think this is a very interesting aspect
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:42.380]   to desire, love, and attachment for the following reason.
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:46.600]   You hear a lot out there that, you know,
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.880]   in order to form a really strong relationship,
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:52.120]   you have to have a good relationship with yourself,
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:54.360]   or you have to love yourself,
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:57.400]   or you often hear, for instance,
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:00.280]   that, you know, it's exactly when you're not looking
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.880]   for a relationship that you're going to find
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.380]   when you hear this stuff, right?
[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:05.760]   But none of that is really grounded in any studies.
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.480]   Again, that's like out of sight, out of mind,
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.320]   or absence makes the heart grow fonder.
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:13.480]   There are many life examples to support those statements,
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:15.380]   and there are many life examples
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:17.280]   to support statements to the opposite.
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.640]   There's a particular study that I found,
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:23.920]   this was published in Frontiers in Psychology,
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:27.980]   but it's a experimental study that involves neuroimaging.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:31.760]   The title of this study is "Manipulation of Self-Expansion
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.460]   Alters Responses to Attractive Alternative Partners."
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:37.140]   And I love the design of this study.
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:40.520]   What they did in this study is they took couples
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:44.520]   and they evaluated members of that relationship
[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:46.480]   for what's called self-expansion.
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:48.760]   Now, self-expansion is a metric
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:53.360]   that involves one's perception of self
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:56.800]   as seen through the relationship to the other.
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.680]   And this is something that was developed
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:02.340]   by the authors are Aaron and Aaron,
[01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:03.440]   so they have the same last name.
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:05.920]   So I'm assuming this was either a sibling team
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:10.160]   or a somehow related team or a romantic couple team.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:13.240]   A-R-O-N and A-R-O-N.
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:16.160]   Aaron and Aaron in 1986 proposed
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:18.680]   the self-expansion model of close relationships.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:20.600]   And they proposed that people are motivated
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:22.520]   to enter relationships, I'm reading here,
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:25.800]   in order to enhance the self and increase self-efficacy.
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:27.960]   In other words, that one of the reasons
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.860]   why many people enter relationships
[01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:31.680]   is that it makes us feel good about ourselves
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.520]   and more capable.
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:34.860]   And I would see that as a healthy interdependence,
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:36.600]   not necessarily co-dependence.
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:41.000]   This is especially strong at the beginning of a relationship,
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.660]   it turns out, when people are forming pair bonds.
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:48.300]   And it's the case that pleasure, arousal, and excitement,
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:50.660]   again, all hallmark features
[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:52.460]   of autonomic nervous system function,
[01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:54.500]   pleasure, arousal, and excitement,
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:59.100]   give rise to self-expansion, meaning to self-efficacy.
[01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:02.240]   So what this self-expansion model is really about
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:05.460]   is how great other people that we are close to
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:08.560]   and romantically attached to can potentially make us feel
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:12.700]   in terms of what they say, in terms of what they do,
[02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:17.700]   in terms of the way in which we believe they feel about us.
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:20.320]   So it doesn't necessarily have to involve
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.040]   explicit statements of them telling us how great we are
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:27.040]   or them doing great gestures for us,
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:30.240]   but how we actually feel they feel about us
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.400]   turns out to be a very strong parameter
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.920]   in terms of how we feel about ourselves
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:36.220]   and the relationship overall.
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:37.740]   Now, some of you out there are probably thinking,
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:40.800]   oh yeah, isn't there this thing, the love languages, right?
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.560]   I don't have any neuroscience to support that.
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:43.600]   I think the love languages,
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:45.820]   I'm not super familiar with this, I didn't list it out,
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:50.780]   but that some people, their autonomic nervous system,
[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:54.440]   if you will, tends to be very responsive to gifts
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:58.200]   or to quality time or to physical touch or acts of kindness.
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.280]   I think I've got a few of these, right?
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.240]   I probably have a few wrong.
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:01.800]   Anyway, they're easy to find online.
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:04.480]   And people do tend to have a kind of a bias
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.900]   toward two or three of these things
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.840]   that are especially meaningful for them.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.060]   And when I hear meaningful,
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:11.860]   I hear they tend to push the autonomic nervous system
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:13.820]   and neurochemical systems of the brain and body
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:15.500]   in a direction that makes us feel good
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.020]   as opposed to lousy or neutral.
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:21.480]   In any event, this study looked at
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:26.360]   whether or not people have high levels of self-expansion
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.040]   through the actions or statements
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:30.360]   of their significant other,
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.800]   and how that influences their perception
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.200]   of people outside the relationship,
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.940]   meaning how attractive they perceive people
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:40.840]   outside the relationship to be,
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:44.840]   turns out to be strongly influenced by A,
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:47.880]   whether or not their self-expansion
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:51.600]   is very strongly driven by the other person
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.240]   that they are involved with,
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:55.440]   that they're in the romantic relationship with,
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:57.560]   and whether or not that's being expressed to them.
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:59.000]   So here's how the study went.
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:03.880]   First of all, they rated or categorized individuals
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:06.120]   on the basis of the self-expansion metric.
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:08.700]   Some people have more of a potential
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:11.800]   to experience self-expansion through others, right?
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.680]   Some of us feel great about ourselves
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:15.440]   and we're kind of topped off at that.
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:17.840]   Others don't feel so great about themselves,
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:20.340]   but they can feel much better in response to praise,
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:23.820]   in particular praise or self-expansion type behaviors
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.840]   or statements from people that we really care about.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.180]   And still other people are a mixture of the two,
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:30.320]   the kind of moderate levels of both.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.360]   So they rated them on this scale,
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.900]   and then they had people experience
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:37.220]   self-expansion narratives.
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:38.540]   They heard their significant other
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:40.840]   say really terrific things about them
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:42.820]   and about the relationship in particular,
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:45.260]   that the relationship that they have
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:47.320]   was exciting, novel, and challenging.
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.060]   So that was one form of self-expansion.
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:50.940]   And they went into some detail as to why
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:53.340]   that was the case in their particular relationship.
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:57.860]   Or they heard a narrative from their significant other
[02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:02.180]   about strong feelings of love between the two
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:04.600]   that had been experienced previously in the relationship.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:07.620]   So in the one case, it's sort of directed more towards them.
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:08.460]   And in the other case,
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:10.580]   it's more about the relationship itself.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:12.820]   And then they did brain imaging
[02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:15.680]   of one person in the relationship,
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:18.640]   while that person assessed the attractiveness
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:21.140]   of people outside the relationship.
[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:23.840]   And what they found was that people who were primed
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:28.680]   for this self-expansion had lower activation
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:30.240]   of brain areas associated
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:32.560]   with assessing other's attractiveness
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:36.600]   than did the people who experienced a lot of self-expansion.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.880]   Now, the takeaway from that,
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:40.480]   at least the way I read this study,
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:44.040]   is if you're with somebody who really benefits
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:47.240]   from or experiences a lot of self-expansion,
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:50.500]   unless you really want them to pay attention
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:52.680]   to the attractiveness of other people,
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:56.320]   it stands to reason that they would benefit
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:01.160]   from more self-expansion type gestures or statements.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:03.260]   Not so much centered on the relationship.
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:04.560]   We have such a great relationship.
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.000]   There's so much love, it's so great.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.520]   That too, but in the context of this study
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:12.160]   and these findings that the person is really terrific,
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:14.040]   that the relationship that they've created together
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:16.360]   is really exciting, novel, and challenging,
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:18.640]   that there's a narrative around the relationship
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:21.120]   that really has a lot to do with the dynamics
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:22.960]   between the individuals, in particular,
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:25.360]   that the person who really likes self-expansion
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:27.180]   is vital to that dynamic, okay?
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:28.840]   So it's not looking down at the relationship
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.080]   as a set of equals.
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.000]   There is sort of this bias written into this
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.980]   of that this person is really essential for the relationship.
[02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:36.760]   I'm not saying this is something that anyone has to do.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:38.040]   I'm not saying this is right or wrong.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.120]   This is just what the data say.
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:42.240]   But what's remarkable is that
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:44.340]   in the absence of those statements,
[02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:48.480]   people who have, or that rate high
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.680]   on this scale of self-expansion
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:54.460]   rate attractive alternative partners as more attractive.
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:57.120]   Now, that's interesting to me because it means
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:00.860]   that their actual perception of others is changing.
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:04.920]   It's not that their opportunity to see others is changing.
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:08.400]   This is not a matter of them somehow getting access
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.140]   or no access to attractive alternative partners.
[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:12.440]   Again, attractive alternative partner
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:14.940]   is literally the language in the title of this paper.
[02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.140]   They're still seeing all these attractive people.
[02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:21.460]   It's just that if they're feeling filled up in air quotes,
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.500]   psychologically filled up, emotionally filled up,
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:28.420]   autonomically filled, enhanced in the language
[02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:31.480]   that we're using today by the self-expansion narrative,
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:34.740]   well then the same set of attractive faces
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:38.460]   appear less attractive to a given individual.
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:41.460]   Now, whether or not this predicts cheating or loyalty,
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:42.980]   I certainly can't say.
[02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:45.740]   That would be very hard to assess in neuroimaging.
[02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:49.920]   And there, of course, people rarely,
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:53.220]   if ever report accurately their cheating behavior.
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:56.200]   There are some studies in which confidentiality is assured
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:59.160]   to the point where people seem to be more trusting
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:01.780]   and willing to reveal cheating behavior.
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:03.560]   But if you look at the statistics on cheating behavior,
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:07.100]   it's very hard to track because people lie all the time
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:09.220]   about their cheating in and outside of the context
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:12.560]   of psychological and neuroimaging studies.
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:14.900]   But I find this study, again,
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:16.700]   the title Manipulation of Self-Expansion
[02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:19.140]   alters responses to attractive alternative partners
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:21.940]   to be absolutely fascinating because, again,
[02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:25.540]   it points to the fact that the interactions
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:29.380]   with our significant others shapes our autonomic arousal,
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:31.540]   shapes our perception of self,
[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:34.000]   and thereby shapes our perception
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.740]   of other potential partners in the outside world,
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:40.100]   or shuts us down to the potential of other people
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:41.460]   in the outside world.
[02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.020]   So when I hear statements such as,
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:44.620]   it's important that you love yourself
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:47.180]   in order to really fall in love with somebody else,
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:51.300]   or it is when one is not looking for a relationship
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:53.060]   that they're most likely to fall in love
[02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:54.620]   and form a stable relationship,
[02:06:54.620 --> 02:06:58.060]   I can filter that through these findings
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:01.460]   to say that it's really the person
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:06.460]   who needs a lot of self-expansion stimulating statements
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:09.100]   or actions coming from other people
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:13.740]   that is most prone to seeing other potential partners
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:15.700]   out in the world as attractive.
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:17.580]   And in this sense,
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:19.660]   we can return to the autonomic nervous system
[02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:23.380]   as kind of a glass that it can be filled up
[02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:24.500]   through various contexts.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:27.260]   It can be filled up through our own ability to regulate it.
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:30.600]   It can be filled up through other people's ability
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:32.820]   to enhance our sense of wellbeing.
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:35.500]   And in some sense, this points to an idea
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:38.320]   where it is true that the better that we can feel
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:43.100]   about ourselves in the absence of any self-expansion type
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:45.620]   input from somebody else really does place us
[02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:48.140]   on more stable ground such that when we do receive
[02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:50.500]   that praise or we do receive those acts of kindness
[02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:53.220]   or service or physical touch or whatever they are,
[02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:58.220]   that we are able to further enhance the way that we feel,
[02:07:58.220 --> 02:08:02.140]   but that we don't necessarily tether all of our feelings
[02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:06.660]   of self-worth or self-expansion to that one individual.
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:10.220]   So you might think that if person A can only receive
[02:08:10.220 --> 02:08:13.580]   the self-expansion from the statements,
[02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:15.740]   from the action of the person they're involved with,
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:19.600]   person B, that that will form a very stable bond.
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:21.220]   But what this study points to is the fact
[02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:23.500]   that that's a very unstable bond,
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:26.140]   that person A is actually very susceptible
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:27.420]   to the attractiveness of others
[02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:29.660]   because they're so desperately attached
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:31.180]   to this notion of self-expansion,
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:32.540]   even if they don't realize it.
[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:34.300]   And so this really does point to the idea
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:37.560]   that while it is important to link
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:40.880]   our autonomic nervous systems to establish desire,
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:43.120]   love, and attachment, that we want to have
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:46.920]   a stable internal representation of ourselves,
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:50.460]   a stable autonomic nervous system to some degree or another,
[02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:54.620]   so that we can be in stable romantic partnership
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:55.680]   with another individual
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:57.380]   if that's what we're really trying to do.
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:59.220]   So until now, I've been weaving together studies
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:01.960]   from the field of experimental psychology
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:06.120]   and the fields of neuroscience, in particular, neuroimaging.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:10.460]   But if you recall back to the very beginning of the episode,
[02:09:10.460 --> 02:09:15.400]   when I was discussing how odors and how hormones
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:18.460]   and how even birth control can shape people's ratings
[02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:20.660]   of attractiveness of others,
[02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:24.660]   you'll realize that there's a deeper layer to all this,
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:27.620]   which is that our biology
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:31.540]   that resides below our conscious awareness,
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:36.180]   things like our hormones, things like pheromones even,
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:41.180]   are shaping the way that we choose, interpret, and act
[02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:45.060]   with other potential romantic partners
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:48.340]   or the romantic partners that we already have.
[02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:52.640]   Now, this cannot be overemphasized, right?
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.020]   No matter how much we would like to create
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:09:58.420]   a sort of top-down description,
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:01.820]   meaning from the cortex and our understanding of things
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:04.640]   onto what we find attractive, who we find attractive,
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:06.740]   what we enjoy, what we don't enjoy
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:10.700]   in the pursuit and romantic interactions with others,
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:14.140]   there always seems to be, and indeed there always is,
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:18.060]   a deeper layer in which our subconscious processing
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:20.820]   drives us to find a particular person
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:22.540]   to be particularly attractive
[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:26.000]   or in which we have chemistry with somebody
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.200]   or in which we lack chemistry with somebody.
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.660]   And I would say that one of the more exciting,
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:35.920]   fascinating, and indeed mysterious aspects
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:39.360]   of desire, love, and attachment
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:41.360]   are those subconscious processes,
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:44.040]   those things that we call chemistry, right?
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:46.260]   I mean, people will report, for instance,
[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:48.180]   that somebody's smell
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:51.440]   is just absolutely positively intoxicating for them
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:53.840]   or that somebody's smell is absolutely repulsive to them
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:55.720]   and they don't know why.
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:58.280]   That the taste of someone's breath,
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:00.600]   and I don't mean that in any kind of poetic sense,
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.560]   I literally mean the taste of somebody's breath
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:07.320]   in some cases can be very exciting to somebody.
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:09.860]   And believe it or not, we can taste each other's breath.
[02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:12.460]   I talked about this in the chemical sensing episode
[02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:17.080]   some months back, but we actually have receptors
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:20.320]   for taste and smell that engage in coordinated action
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:23.280]   such that we can't really separate taste and smell
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:25.700]   at some level, and this is especially true
[02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:28.360]   when it comes to the formation of romantic relationships
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.040]   and what we call chemistry.
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:32.800]   Now, is chemistry absolutely required
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:36.880]   for forming stable attachments for love and for desire?
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:38.800]   No, of course they're not.
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:42.820]   But in general, these are primitive mechanisms
[02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:44.440]   that exist in all animals.
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:47.340]   They exist in special forms in humans,
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:51.020]   but that they drive us toward behaviors that will,
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:55.560]   as the theory goes, lead to love and attachment,
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:58.220]   not always, as Dr. Fisher pointed out,
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.780]   that sex and sex drive is one way
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:03.200]   to explore potential love relationships
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.800]   and to explore potential attachments,
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:08.440]   which of course are major investments
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:11.240]   that extend well beyond one night or a week
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:13.420]   or a vacation or even a year.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:15.920]   When we talk about stable attachments in general,
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:18.860]   that means long-term attachments in humans.
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:23.860]   Now, there is a biology to all of that chemistry stuff,
[02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:27.300]   and the studies of oral contraception
[02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:29.440]   and men finding women more attractive
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:31.540]   at certain phases of their menstrual cycle
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:34.540]   and women finding men more attractive
[02:12:34.540 --> 02:12:36.980]   at certain phases of the woman's menstrual cycle
[02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:39.580]   point to the incredible power
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:41.520]   of those deeper biological mechanisms.
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:44.620]   In the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:47.600]   I discussed both science and science-based tools,
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:50.740]   and so I'd be remiss if I didn't actually cover
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:52.300]   some of the tools that relate
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:55.100]   to those deeper biological mechanisms.
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:59.100]   Now, the hormones testosterone and estrogen
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:02.660]   are almost always the first biological chemicals
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:06.580]   and hormones that are mentioned and described and explored
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:09.820]   when thinking about desire
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:12.380]   and love and attachment too, for that matter,
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:15.160]   since love and attachment stem from desire.
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:18.300]   I did an entire episode
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:21.540]   about the biology of testosterone and estrogen
[02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:25.140]   and ways to optimize testosterone and estrogen.
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:28.500]   You can easily find that episode at HubermanLab.com.
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:29.400]   It's timestamped.
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:31.220]   There you can find all sorts of information
[02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:34.820]   about how certain behaviors or absence of behaviors
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:37.680]   drive up or down testosterone and estrogen.
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:41.120]   I also dispel some myths about sexual behavior
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:42.560]   and things like masturbation
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.700]   and how they relate to testosterone and estrogen,
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:48.480]   as well as some myths about how those hormones change
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:49.560]   across the lifespan.
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:52.580]   I also talk about the role of exercise.
[02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:54.040]   I talk about supplementation,
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:55.580]   and I also talk a little bit
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:57.100]   about hormone replacement therapy,
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:59.660]   although that will be the topic for a future episode.
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:00.500]   So if you're interested
[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:02.600]   in the biology of testosterone and estrogen,
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.460]   two hormones that absolutely influence things
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:07.700]   like libido and desire,
[02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:08.920]   please check out that episode
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:10.980]   as well as what I'm going to talk about
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:12.220]   in just a moment here.
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:13.920]   The simple stereotyped version
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.860]   of the hormones testosterone and estrogen
[02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:19.680]   are that testosterone drives libido
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:21.820]   or increases it, AKA sex drive,
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.980]   and that estrogen somehow blunts it
[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:26.820]   or is not involved in libido and sex drive.
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:29.000]   And that is simply not the case.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.260]   As I described in that testosterone
[02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:33.180]   and estrogen optimization episode,
[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:35.020]   and as I'll tell you now,
[02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:38.820]   yes, testosterone and some of its other forms
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:42.120]   like dihydrotestosterone are strongly related
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:45.400]   to libido and sex drive and the pursuit
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:46.580]   and ability to mate.
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:51.460]   However, the hormone estrogen is also strongly associated
[02:14:51.460 --> 02:14:53.620]   with libido and mating behavior.
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:57.780]   So much so that for people that either chemically
[02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:00.940]   or for some other reason have very low estrogen,
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:02.920]   libido can severely suffer.
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:05.540]   So it's a coordinated dance of estrogen
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:07.380]   and testosterone in both males and females
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:10.380]   that leads to libido or sex drive.
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:13.380]   So I absolutely wanted to make clear
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:16.620]   that it's not a simple relationship
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:18.520]   between testosterone and sex drive
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:19.580]   or estrogen and sex drive.
[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:23.260]   Both are required at appropriate ratios.
[02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:26.060]   Now, with that said,
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:30.400]   there are things that can shift libido
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:35.340]   in both men and women in the direction of more desire
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:38.580]   or more desire to mate either to seek mates
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:41.700]   or to mate with existing partners.
[02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:44.300]   And there's a quite solid literature
[02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:46.720]   around a few of those substances.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:49.580]   Now, a common misconception is that because dopamine
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:52.200]   is involved in motivation and drive,
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.220]   that simply increasing dopamine
[02:15:54.220 --> 02:15:57.440]   through any number of different mechanisms or tools
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:59.860]   will increase libido and sex drive.
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:02.320]   And that's simply not the case either.
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:08.460]   It is true that some level of dopamine
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:11.080]   or increase in dopamine is required
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:14.220]   for increases in libido.
[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:16.620]   However, because of dopamine's relationship
[02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:18.380]   to the autonomic nervous system,
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:21.220]   and because the autonomic nervous system
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:24.420]   is so intimately involved, no pun intended,
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:28.760]   in sexual activity, in seeking and actual mating behavior,
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:31.540]   as I described earlier, it's actually the case
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:35.660]   that if people drive their dopamine system too high,
[02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:40.660]   they will be in states of arousal that are high enough,
[02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:44.400]   such that they seek and want sexual activity,
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:47.420]   but they can't actually engage the parasympathetic arm
[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:49.240]   of the autonomic nervous system sufficient
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:51.200]   to become physically aroused.
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.800]   Now, there's a whole description of this
[02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:55.540]   that awaits us in a future episode,
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:58.060]   but I'll summarize now by saying,
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:01.180]   for people that are taking substances
[02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:03.320]   just simply to increase dopamine,
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:06.520]   in order to increase libido,
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.780]   that can be a potentially hazardous route to follow,
[02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:13.860]   because depending on whether or not that dopamine level
[02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:16.820]   is high enough that it puts them into a mode
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:20.880]   of seeking mates or mating,
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:23.820]   but they can't adjust their autonomic nervous system
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:25.440]   during actual mating behavior,
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:27.440]   what essentially is I'm saying is it can place people
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:29.020]   into a chronic pursuit,
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.980]   but an inability to perform sexually,
[02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:33.520]   and this is true for men and women, okay?
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:37.200]   So I would just caution people against just thinking,
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:40.780]   oh, a lack of libido is simply a lack of dopamine.
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:41.920]   That is not the case.
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:44.820]   It could be from lower levels of dopamine,
[02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:47.680]   but it could also be for other reasons.
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:50.040]   And so these systems, these signaling systems
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:53.120]   and these neurochemicals are very intricate,
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:55.800]   and just simply ramping up dopamine
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:57.260]   has actually been found, for instance,
[02:17:57.260 --> 02:18:00.060]   in amphetamine and cocaine users,
[02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:02.480]   there is a phenomenon in which they become hyper aroused,
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:03.720]   but can't perform sexually.
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:06.720]   This is also true for people who take elevated levels
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:11.040]   of other recreational drugs or who take antidepressants
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:14.200]   that increase the dopamine system too much, right?
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:17.000]   Dosage has to be worked out with your physician,
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.840]   with your psychiatrist, such that, you know,
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:23.000]   mood is enhanced and the various aspects
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.020]   of a healthy wellbeing, mind and body are enhanced,
[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:29.400]   but not so much so that that what we call the arousal arc
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:34.400]   is locked with the seesaw in the sympathetic drive position
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:37.560]   such that sexual arousal can't occur, okay?
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:39.900]   So this is an important point to make
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:43.320]   because I think that a lot of people are under the impression
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:47.080]   that if they just drive up testosterone, increase dopamine,
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:49.240]   and generally get themselves into high states
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:50.240]   of autonomic arousal,
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:52.520]   that that's going to increase the libido,
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:54.620]   but that's simply not the way the system works.
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:57.580]   It's that seesaw and that seesawing back and forth
[02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:01.280]   that is the arc of arousal that we talked about earlier.
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:06.280]   Now, there are substances, legal over-the-counter substances
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:09.280]   that fall under the categorization of supplements
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:13.140]   that do indeed increase libido and arousal.
[02:19:13.140 --> 02:19:14.440]   And so I'm going to talk about some of those
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:17.620]   in the context of peer-reviewed literature now.
[02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:18.960]   I want to be clear, however,
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:21.600]   that these are by no means required.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:24.280]   Many people have healthy libidos or have libidos
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:28.260]   that are healthy for their life and what they need and want.
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:32.520]   And as always, in any discussion about supplementation,
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:34.360]   you absolutely have to check with your physician.
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:35.640]   I don't just say that to protect us.
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:37.120]   I say that to protect you.
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:38.920]   Your health and wellbeing is dependent on you
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:40.540]   doing certain things and not doing others,
[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:42.080]   and everybody is different.
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.640]   Nonetheless, there are studies
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:45.800]   that point to specific substances
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:47.440]   that are sold over-the-counter
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:49.320]   that at least in the United States are legal
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.540]   and that have been shown to be statistically significant
[02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:56.160]   in increasing measures of libido.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:58.440]   There are many such substances,
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:02.920]   but three that in particular have good peer-reviewed research
[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:07.920]   to support them are MACA, M-A-C-A,
[02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:10.400]   which is actually a root.
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:13.160]   Tongat Ali, also sometimes called long jack.
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:14.960]   I didn't name them, forgive me.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:18.800]   And tribulus or tribulus, it's sometimes called.
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:21.420]   I'm going to talk about each of these in sequence,
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:26.420]   but on the whole, the studies on MACA are quite convincing
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:32.960]   that consumption of two to three grams per day of MACA,
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:36.720]   which generally is sold as a powder or a capsule,
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:40.000]   typically consumed early in the day
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000]   because it can be somewhat of a stimulant,
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.040]   meaning it can increase alertness
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:46.940]   and you wouldn't want it to interfere with sleep
[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:48.640]   by taking it too late in the day.
[02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:51.940]   But in studies that include both men and women
[02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:54.400]   of durations anywhere from eight to 12 weeks
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:57.480]   of athletes and non-athletes,
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:00.540]   and different variations of MACA,
[02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:03.600]   turns out there's black MACA, red MACA, yellow MACA.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:06.080]   There are a bunch of different forms of MACA,
[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:10.040]   but that they can increase subjective reports
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:15.040]   of sexual desire independent of hormone systems,
[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:16.760]   meaning it does not seem,
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:19.040]   at least based on the existing literature,
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:22.080]   that MACA increases testosterone or changes estrogen,
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:24.920]   at least not on the timescales that these studies were done
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:27.760]   or with the measures that were performed in these studies.
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:31.520]   But that MACA, again, consumed in doses
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:34.240]   of anywhere from two to three grams per day,
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:37.520]   has been shown to significantly increase libido.
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:41.820]   And in fact, those dosages of MACA have been shown
[02:21:41.820 --> 02:21:46.820]   to offset so-called SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.
[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:51.060]   So there are various routes to sexual dysfunction.
[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:55.140]   The SSRIs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:57.260]   They go by name brands like Prozac and Zoloft,
[02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:58.640]   and there are many others now,
[02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:00.660]   and generic forms and so forth.
[02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:03.620]   Those don't always, I should point out,
[02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:04.900]   lead to sexual dysfunction.
[02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:06.880]   There's a dose dependence.
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:09.660]   Some people do quite well on SSRIs
[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:11.660]   and don't have any issues with sexual function.
[02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:15.260]   Other people suffer quite a lot from sexual dysfunction
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:18.040]   while taking SSRIs, highly variable.
[02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:22.840]   You need to work with a physician, a qualified psychiatrist.
[02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:25.300]   But nonetheless, everything I've been saying
[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:29.400]   about MACA thus far has also been explored
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:32.000]   in the context of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.960]   The paper that I'm referring to here
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:37.840]   is a double-blind randomized pilot dose-finding study
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:39.020]   of MACA root.
[02:22:39.020 --> 02:22:41.920]   It goes by the name L. Mayeni.
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:43.160]   These always have fancy names,
[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:45.780]   and the Latin names in biology are always more complicated,
[02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:48.740]   but it's MACA root for the management of SSRI-induced
[02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:49.880]   sexual dysfunction.
[02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:52.680]   First author is Dording, D-O-R-D-I-N-G.
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:56.040]   This was a study done at Mass General,
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:59.300]   which is one of the satellite locations
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:02.740]   around Harvard Med, it's associated with Harvard Med,
[02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:06.940]   that found significant improvements in libido
[02:23:06.940 --> 02:23:08.900]   when people were taking a pretty low dose.
[02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:11.880]   It was actually, in this case, just 1.5 grams per day
[02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:17.120]   up to a high dose, three grams per day, of MACA.
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:19.960]   And they were doing this in 20 remitted depressed
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:22.120]   outpatients, so these are people that had depression.
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:25.000]   Their depression was successfully treated with SSRIs,
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.820]   but they were suffering from some of these SSRI-related
[02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:30.120]   sexual effects, and MACA seemed to offset
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:33.660]   some of those effects significantly in this population.
[02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:37.380]   The other studies exploring the lack of effect
[02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:41.200]   on serum testosterone in adult healthy men
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:44.260]   was a 12-week study, again, consuming anywhere
[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:48.020]   from 1.5 to 3 milligrams, meaning 1, excuse me,
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:51.240]   1,500 milligrams to 3,000 milligrams or placebo.
[02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:56.240]   So again, this is 1.5 up to three grams of MACA or placebo,
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:00.660]   and they rated sexual desire, depression,
[02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:04.580]   and other measures such as testosterone in the blood.
[02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:08.500]   Again, no change in testosterone or estrogen,
[02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:11.020]   estradiol levels in men treated with MACA,
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:14.160]   and those treated with placebo, but nonetheless,
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:17.400]   there was a significant and positive effect on libido
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:21.160]   with this dosage of 1.5 to three grams per day of MACA.
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:24.900]   And there are several other studies that also show this,
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:28.500]   again, in people that are taking SRIs
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:31.220]   and people that are not taking SSRIs
[02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:34.980]   in chronically over-trained athletes.
[02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:36.260]   This was also found to be the case.
[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:39.260]   So it seems like across the board MACA
[02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:42.060]   is a fairly useful supplement
[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:44.700]   for those that are seeking to increase their libido.
[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:47.460]   And there are fewer studies involving women,
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:50.580]   but there are a few such studies that also point
[02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:53.420]   to the same general positive effect on libido
[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:56.000]   in women taking MACA at equivalent doses
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.460]   to those I just described.
[02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:00.140]   I think it's noteworthy that MACA supplementation
[02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:04.220]   does not seem to adjust testosterone or estrogen levels
[02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:07.460]   to any significant degree, but it does change libido.
[02:25:07.460 --> 02:25:09.460]   I think that points to the fact
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:11.840]   that there are multiple systems in the brain and body
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:15.180]   that influence libido, not just testosterone and estrogen.
[02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:16.460]   And indeed, we know that to be the case.
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:21.020]   Things like PEA, which is a substance found in chocolate
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:23.700]   and is a substance that some people supplement
[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:27.100]   is known for instance, to increase sexual desire,
[02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:30.220]   but also the perception of sexual experiences
[02:25:30.220 --> 02:25:32.660]   as more stimulating, for instance.
[02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:34.520]   So there are a lot of pathways in the brain,
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:36.860]   in particular in the hypothalamus,
[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:39.900]   this ancient area of our brain that harbors neurons
[02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:43.580]   and hormone secreting cells, including neurons,
[02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:46.740]   that can shape our perceptions of our,
[02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:50.540]   even just our tactile experience of others
[02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:53.340]   and their attractiveness and indeed can shift levels
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:56.620]   of desire independent of changing levels
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.140]   of circulating hormones.
[02:25:58.140 --> 02:26:01.100]   Another substance that has been shown to increase libido
[02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:05.380]   across a range of human populations is so-called
[02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:06.780]   tongkat ali.
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:09.060]   I've talked a little bit about this before
[02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:13.380]   on the Huberman Lab podcast in reference to testosterone.
[02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:15.340]   And I've talked about it extensively as a guest
[02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:16.580]   on other podcasts.
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:19.100]   Tongkat ali goes by a number of different names.
[02:26:19.100 --> 02:26:22.660]   One of them is exceedingly difficult for me to pronounce.
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:26.780]   It's uricoma longifolia, also called longjack,
[02:26:26.780 --> 02:26:30.380]   but tongkat ali is the typical name.
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:31.380]   This is an herb.
[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:34.860]   There's a Malaysian version and an Indonesian version.
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:37.500]   My understanding is that the Indonesian variety
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:39.980]   of tongkat ali is the one that is most potent
[02:26:39.980 --> 02:26:43.020]   for its effects on libido.
[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:46.280]   Previously, I've talked about tongkat ali
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:49.740]   taken in 400 milligram per day capsules
[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:53.140]   as a means to increase the amount of free,
[02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:55.220]   meaning unbound testosterone.
[02:26:55.220 --> 02:26:58.920]   So testosterone has a both bound form and an unbound form.
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:02.460]   Very briefly, the bound form is bound to albumin
[02:27:02.460 --> 02:27:06.440]   in the blood or to so-called sex hormone binding globulin.
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:10.620]   When it's bound, it can't be biologically active
[02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:11.940]   at many cells.
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:13.780]   It is important that some of it be bound
[02:27:13.780 --> 02:27:15.860]   in order to get a sort of time release
[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:18.380]   and proper distribution of testosterone through the body,
[02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:21.040]   but it is the unbound free testosterone
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:23.460]   that can really have its most potent effects.
[02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:26.620]   And there's some evidence that tongkat ali
[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:30.620]   can increase the amount of unbound so-called free testosterone
[02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:33.180]   by lowering sex hormone binding globulin,
[02:27:33.180 --> 02:27:36.260]   although it is almost certain that it has other routes
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:37.740]   of mechanism as well.
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:41.900]   Nonetheless, there are some reports
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:44.940]   of tongkat ali increasing libido.
[02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:48.400]   One particular article, last author,
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:51.460]   or I should say last name of first author, excuse me,
[02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:53.480]   Ismail, I-S-M-A-L.
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.660]   This was published in an evidence-based complimentary
[02:27:57.660 --> 02:27:58.900]   and alternative medicine.
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:00.180]   It's from 2012.
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:05.140]   Reports a significant increase in libido and sexual function.
[02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:07.900]   There are other such studies, not a lot of them,
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:12.820]   not as many robust controlled quality peer reviewed studies
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:14.140]   as there are from MACA.
[02:28:14.140 --> 02:28:16.740]   Nonetheless, a number of people, men and women
[02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:19.340]   that I know do take tongkat ali
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:21.180]   and it seems to work well for them.
[02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:22.580]   The question always comes up
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:23.880]   around discussion of supplements.
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:25.420]   Do you need to cycle these things?
[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:27.200]   The only way to determine that is really
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:29.900]   to do your blood work, monitor liver enzymes,
[02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:32.160]   monitor hormone levels and so forth.
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:35.120]   So I simply can't say whether or not you need to
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:36.680]   or you don't need to cycle them.
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:40.940]   Typically, tongkat ali and MACA are not cycled
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:43.580]   in any regular kind of way that I'm aware of.
[02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:46.280]   But again, you really need to check with your doctor
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:49.220]   if you're going to initiate taking any of these things.
[02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.940]   And you certainly should do your best
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:53.540]   to monitor your blood work as well as subjective measures
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:55.420]   in evaluating whether or not they're working for you,
[02:28:55.420 --> 02:28:56.740]   say for you and so forth.
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:59.260]   The third and final substance/supplement
[02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:01.940]   that I want to touch on as it relates to libido
[02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:04.740]   is called tribulus terrestis.
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:09.740]   So that's T-R-I-B-U-L-U-S, terrestis, T-E-R-R-E-S, T-R-I-S.
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:16.340]   This is a commonly sold over-the-counter supplement
[02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:21.340]   for increasing testosterone for fitness purposes and so on.
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:24.660]   Whether or not it actually does that
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:27.680]   to a meaningful degree isn't clear,
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:31.180]   but I'm aware of four peer-reviewed studies
[02:29:31.180 --> 02:29:36.720]   that were focused on both males and females,
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:39.800]   ranging anywhere from 18 years old
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:43.200]   all the way up to 65 plus, they say 65 plus,
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:45.780]   I guess it could be 70, it could be 80, I don't know.
[02:29:45.780 --> 02:29:48.640]   But a fairly broad age range
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:53.000]   where people took anywhere from 750 milligrams per day
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:57.380]   divided into three equal doses.
[02:29:57.380 --> 02:30:01.340]   So 750 total per day divided into three equal doses
[02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:05.400]   of tribulus or placebo for 120 days.
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:08.720]   This particular study was focused on females.
[02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:11.180]   And according to the female sexual function
[02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:13.940]   index questionnaire, no significant difference
[02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:15.540]   between any of the groups.
[02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:19.260]   However, free and bioavailable testosterone
[02:30:19.260 --> 02:30:21.860]   increased in the group taking tribulus terrestis.
[02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:25.280]   Total testosterone did not reach statistical significance.
[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:28.420]   So this is sort of the inverse of what we see with MACA
[02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:31.120]   where there do seem to be increases in testosterone,
[02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:34.700]   which would predict that there would be increase in libido.
[02:30:34.700 --> 02:30:37.900]   In this case, this was post-menopausal women.
[02:30:37.900 --> 02:30:39.200]   There was no increase in libido.
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:41.100]   There was an increase in testosterone.
[02:30:41.100 --> 02:30:43.620]   I mention it only because there might be instances
[02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:47.740]   in which people want to increase their testosterone.
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:50.200]   It does seem that tribulus, at least in that population,
[02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:51.820]   is capable of doing that.
[02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:54.420]   Now, there's a separate study that was done,
[02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:58.420]   a double-blind study lasting anywhere from one to six months
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:02.320]   that had a clear and significant increase in libido.
[02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:05.040]   Now, this was taking six grams.
[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:09.460]   So that's 6,000 milligrams of tribulus root for 60 days.
[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:11.700]   And it did seem to increase various aspects
[02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:12.860]   of sexual function.
[02:31:12.860 --> 02:31:17.580]   And there was what appeared to be a substantial
[02:31:17.580 --> 02:31:20.260]   16.3% increase in testosterone.
[02:31:20.260 --> 02:31:21.760]   But in this particular study,
[02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:24.640]   because of the variability across individuals
[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:27.580]   that did not actually arrive at statistical significance.
[02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:29.640]   Now, there were a number of other studies
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:32.560]   that explored the role of tribulus,
[02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:34.640]   in particular in females.
[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:37.640]   And one of those studies was a study
[02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:39.220]   that was actually quite short.
[02:31:39.220 --> 02:31:40.680]   It was two to four weeks.
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:43.040]   It involved 67 subjects.
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:46.480]   These were subjects that had experienced a loss of libido
[02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:50.020]   and took tribulus, divided into two equal doses,
[02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:51.600]   compared that to placebo.
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:54.360]   And they did see a significant improvement
[02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:58.020]   in these measures of sexual desire and function
[02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:00.400]   on this female sexual function index.
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:03.160]   So there is some evidence that tribulus can be effective
[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:06.080]   in increasing testosterone in certain populations,
[02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:08.760]   in increasing sexual desire and function
[02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:12.000]   in certain populations, particular in females.
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.920]   I think more studies are certainly needed,
[02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:17.880]   but these three substances/supplements,
[02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:22.560]   maca, tonga ali in particular, Indonesian tonga ali,
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:27.040]   and tribulus can indeed create significant increases
[02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:29.520]   in sexual desire, and in some cases,
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:33.180]   by adjusting the testosterone and estrogen system,
[02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:35.000]   in some cases, not by adjusting
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.600]   the testosterone and estrogen system.
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:40.560]   Again, pointing to the complexity of neurochemicals
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:44.600]   and features that adjust things like libido, aka desire.
[02:32:44.600 --> 02:32:46.720]   So we covered a lot of material today
[02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:49.120]   related to desire, love, and attachment.
[02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:52.600]   And yet I acknowledge that it is not exhaustive
[02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:56.760]   of the vast landscape that is the psychology and biology
[02:32:56.760 --> 02:32:59.100]   of desire, love, and attachment.
[02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:01.360]   Nonetheless, I hope that you found
[02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:04.680]   the information interesting and hopefully actionable
[02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:08.120]   in some cases toward the relationships of your past,
[02:33:08.120 --> 02:33:11.720]   of present, and potentially for the relationships
[02:33:11.720 --> 02:33:13.200]   of your future.

[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:03.000]   Some of that material overlaps
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.920]   with material covered on the podcast.
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:06.360]   Some of it is unique material
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:08.480]   only covered on Instagram and Twitter.
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:10.760]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:11.920]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:14.020]   we discussed supplements.
[02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:15.640]   While supplements aren't necessary
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:17.400]   or appropriate for everybody,
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:19.740]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:22.720]   for things like enhancing sleep, enhancing focus,
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:26.600]   or as discussed today, for enhancing libido and desire.
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:28.320]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:32.440]   you can go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:34.240]   the letter U/huberman,
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:37.080]   and there you can get 20% off any of the supplements
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:38.060]   that I take.
[02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:40.280]   And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:44.920]   through that portal, thorne.com/ the letter U/huberman,
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:47.860]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:48.920]   that Thorne makes.
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:49.960]   We partnered with Thorne
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:52.400]   because Thorne has the absolute highest standards
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:54.680]   with respect to the quality of the ingredients
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:57.080]   in their supplements and the precision of the amounts
[02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:58.240]   of those supplements.
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:00.560]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:03.040]   about desire, love, and attachment.
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:05.280]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:07.080]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:09.660]   [upbeat music]
[02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:12.240]   (upbeat music)
