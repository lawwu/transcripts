[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast. With me, I have a special guest,
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.080]   Mike Ketchmark, who is a trial attorney. You might have heard of him from winning the landmark
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.800]   lawsuit regarding real estate collusion against the National Association of Realtors, Keller
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.680]   Williams and Home Services of America. Welcome to the podcast, Mike.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.360]   Hey, great to be here. Thanks for having me.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:41.560]   I saw the news and I was absolutely shocked at the amount, $1.78 billion. And then it talked
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.560]   about trouble damages of potentially over $5 billion. And I was wondering if you could share
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.720]   with the audience, how did those numbers come about? And then as we go on, what could be next
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.000]   for the whole industry?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.400]   Sure. Standing alone, it's a shocking amount of money, but if you break it down into what
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.840]   it involved, we represented 500,000 people across the state of Missouri who sold them
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.280]   over 260,000 homes over a seven-year time period. On average, our clients were schemed
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.200]   and bilked out of $7,000. And so as an individual, it's not that much, but as it adds up,
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.240]   it's a tremendous amount. And actually what I described to the jury in this case, and I did
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.200]   during the jury selection process, talked about numbers can be these huge numbers. And what I
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.040]   said during closing argument is the defendants talked about, "Well, so much money. Look how
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.680]   much money it is." But I said, "Look, if you rob one bank for $7,000, you don't get to keep it
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.840]   because you robbed 260,000 banks and it's just too much money to get back." And that's why it's
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.880]   a lot of money. And that's why they've got away with it, in my opinion, for so long is because
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.520]   they just take little pieces of the American dream and of our home equity, but they do it so far and
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.680]   so vast and in such a large scale that it adds up to almost $70 billion a year in our country
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.720]   in wasted commission dollars. That's unbelievable.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.800]   And under the federal antitrust law, it's called the Sherman Antitrust Act. It was passed back in
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.720]   the late 1800s, a time when corporations had a lot of power, in a lot of ways they still do. But
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.360]   monopolies were really huge back then. And the law was passed. And what it said is, "If you can
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.320]   prove price fixing, competitors getting together and fixing prices, we're creating a system like
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.040]   this was created to fix prices." And not only do you get your money back, it's effectively a refund
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.600]   case, but then they do what they call triple damages. They triple the damages. And it's designed
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.960]   to punish the defendants, to stop them from engaging in behavior like this. And so that's what
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.720]   happened. And people thought that we stood very little chance of winning. It was a tough case. We
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.920]   had a group of, I think, four heroes. They stepped up and we had a retired police officer, a retired
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800]   school teacher, a public school advocate, an attorney who works in elderly law, as our main
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.440]   plaintiffs. And we, four years ago, filed this lawsuit on their behalf for a lot of the same
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.960]   reasons that you and I talked about offline, about the fact that what's happening in our
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.480]   country is wrong with forcing, when you sell your home in our country, it's one of the only
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.520]   countries in the world that does this. You're forced as a seller of a home to pay the buyer's
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.080]   agent's commission in order to list your house on the internet. And the National Association of
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   Realtors is functioning effectively as a cartel. They've carved our country up into 880 different
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.400]   regions for these multiple listing services. And the only way to list your house on the internet
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.120]   is through the MLS. And the only way to do it is if you agree to pay the buyer's commission. You
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.200]   can't put your house on Zillow. You can't put it on realtor.com. You can't have it anywhere on the
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   internet unless it's done that way. And it's designed by them to take control of the housing
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.560]   market.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.640]   Right, right. That's unbelievable. I was looking at a statistic for 2022, and it showed that the
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.000]   lobbyists, that the companies or groups that spent the most amount of money lobbying, and the
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.540]   National Association of Realtors was number one at around $88 million. What are they doing when
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.680]   they're spending all that money? Is it whining and dining at the Capitol Grill? What are they up
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.360]   to with that money?
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.220]   Yeah, and that's one of the things we do a lot of to prepare for trials. I do something called a
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.440]   mock trial where we'll pull together jurors, and I'll put the plaintiff's case on, the
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.200]   defendant's will put, we'll have a defense lawyer put the defendant's case on. And one of the
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.720]   things I kept hearing throughout this case is they kept referring to themselves as a not-for-profit,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.080]   or not-for-profit, or not-for-profit. Well, what I didn't understand until I started getting into
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.060]   this and looking at these mock trials is when I think of a not-for-profit, I think of a 501(c)(3),
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:09.340]   like a church or the Boy Scouts or the Salvation Army. But there's actually a 50(c)(6), and that's
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.480]   a special entity that the real estate industry, I kid you not, they've set them up with a special
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.800]   lobbying interest. So all it means is they don't pay taxes. And it's called a 50(c)(6) corporation,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.880]   or 50(c)(6). And what they do with that money is they pass laws to protect their corporate
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.640]   interests. And when you have, like in the Northwest MLS in Seattle, they tried to break away from
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.800]   the control of the National Association of Realtors. So they actually passed a law in the
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.440]   state of Washington that said that you don't have to show a house as a buyer's agent unless the
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.040]   seller agrees to pay your commission.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.520]   That's ridiculous.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.320]   They break that into the contract, and they bake that into law. And it's just designed, I think,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.080]   and I told this, explained this to the jury, that trade associations can be good things if they
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.160]   focus on ethics, they focus on education, like the American Medical Association, the American Bar
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.520]   Association, American Teachers Association. But when they focus on money and commissions and
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.680]   getting competitors together to rig the system, that's where corruption happens. And that's when
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.440]   lobbyists become too powerful. And it was stunning to me. I mean, I always think of lobbyists and I
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.200]   think, you know, big pharma and the insurance industry and the Chamber of Commerce. And when
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.280]   you realize that more money is being spent by this Realtor Association than anyplace else, it's
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:44.160]   mind-numbing. It's because they are literally pulling $300 million a year out of the pocket of
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.080]   local realtors and putting it into their corporate coffers at NARC. And doing that because local
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.080]   real estate agents have to blister houses on them less to make a living. And so they have this whole
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.680]   thing propped up. And we saw what happened. That's what led to the president of the organization
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.160]   being run out on rampant charges of sexual harassment. At trial, we ended up not putting this
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.640]   in as evidence because the judge thought it was more prejudicial than probative. But the CEO who
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.720]   just left the National Association of Realtors, he was making $3 million a year. And he had,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.240]   he had, in his contract, they had to pay for him to be a member of a country club in Chicago,
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.280]   a country club in DC, first-class travel, pet service, first-class job for his wife,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.520]   all of his living expenses. And it's all on the backs of local realtors. And it is,
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.200]   it's just awful. And so when we got involved in this, we got a pretty small group of lawyers. I
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.320]   mean, there's only four attorneys in my firm, myself and three other people. And then the other
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.920]   firm we were with, he's just got two lawyers. And we're like, you know, we want to take these folks
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.480]   on and we want to hold them accountable. And so it really kind of felt David and Goliath-eth,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:06.080]   but it was a worthy fight and struggle. Definitely a worthy fight and struggle.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.080]   I love to talk about probabilities. And what do you think, what was your thought in terms of the
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.760]   probability of you winning the case before you found the verdict? And also, what were you thinking
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:25.360]   could be the potential damages or the win amount? I mean, I always felt from the first time that I
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:35.040]   got involved in this case that we would win. But my wife tells me sometimes that I put hope over
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:42.120]   experience. But look, I felt it's a righteous cause. I felt factually we were right, legally
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.040]   we were right. So I just always said in my heart, I thought that we would win. And I told the jury
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.760]   that my mom and dad sat through the whole trial, one of the coolest things, having them sit in the
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.240]   front row during their mid-eighties. And I told the jury that I learned every single thing that
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.960]   I needed to learn about this case from my mom when I was in kindergarten. If you take something that
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.840]   doesn't belong to you, you have to give it back. And we proved the trial that they were taking
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.560]   money that didn't belong to them. And so we asked to have it refunded and give it back. And I really
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:20.640]   felt that we were going to win. But you know, the other, we got some really talented attorneys,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:27.840]   probably at times we'd have 50 lawyers watching in trial on both sides. And a lot of my friends
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.640]   and colleagues and men and women who have practiced within Kansas City come and watch. You'd ask them
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.560]   what odds they think we're winning. They'd say 60%, 65%. I always thought it was 9,800%.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:48.400]   But maybe because it's my skill as an advocate. You know, you don't know because the hard part
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.080]   about federal court, a lot of people don't know this, is you have to have an unanimous jury. And
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:59.920]   in our day and age, trying to get, we had eight people on the jury, trying to get eight people
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:07.320]   to agree on anything is difficult. But the cool thing about this is regardless of your politics,
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.880]   we had one of our expert witnesses used to be in the antitrust division, Deputy Attorney General
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:20.280]   under Donald Trump. Another one of our experts who we worked with in this case worked in the Obama
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:26.880]   administration. We were working with advocates from the Cato Institute, a very libertarian,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.240]   conservative think tank, and some housing advocates who were very much on the left-leaning
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:42.880]   side. Everyone universally agreed that corruption and fixing the prices in real estate is wrong.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.240]   And so I really believe that if I was able to distill this down into principles that a jury
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.960]   can understand that they would be disgusted. And they were. They were absolutely disgusted
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.320]   with their behavior. Yeah. I mean, now that the verdict is
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.520]   done, it seems obvious to a lot of people there was price fixing. There was real estate collusion.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:11.920]   I myself sold a house in 2017. I argued down to a 4.5% commission, but I had to pay 2.5% to the
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.480]   buyer's agent while the buyer's agent was hammering me down on price during the contingency process.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.960]   It was like, "Give me $35,000 for the window credit and all that." And I was thinking to
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.400]   myself, "Why am I paying you a 2.5% commission while you're trying to hammer me down on price?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.000]   This is totally misaligned incentives." And so after I sold the house, I told myself,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.240]   "I'm never going to sell a house again until there's a change in the real estate commission
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.960]   structure." So to me, it seemed really obvious there was some type of collusion,
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:47.440]   price fixing that wasn't fair to the consumer. Why do you think this has lasted for so long, Mike?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.720]   It's been around for a hundred years. The National Association of Realtors,
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:56.160]   when they first reformed, actually had price cards where they would pass it out and they
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.000]   would set the commissions at 6%. And then in the 1950s, the Supreme Court struck it down and said
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.840]   it was against the law. And then for the longest time, what they did when my wife and I first
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.400]   bought our house in 1990 in a little small town outside of Kansas City called Lee's Summit,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.040]   Missouri, we had a phone book and it was called an MLS book. And a lot of the people who are
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.120]   listening, you're certainly too young to remember this, but they used to be in big, thick books.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.560]   It was multiple listing book and there'd be pictures of homes and a description of houses.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.400]   And we'd sit down with our agent at a local coffee shop and we'd go through and flag the
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.240]   houses in our price range. We'd go around and see open houses. And on the outside of those books,
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.960]   I actually introduced one of them at trial. I had to go on eBay and buy it. It said, "Property of
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.640]   the National Association of Realtors, $1,000 fine to let this get into the wrong hands."
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.480]   And what the seller's agents would do is they'd pass them to the buyer's agents and they would
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.320]   control the information. And when they had control of the information, they could fix the prices.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.720]   But then the internet comes along and they're really worried about it shifting things. And
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.880]   the word that they use is disintermediate. They were worried about it getting in the middle and
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.800]   knocking them to the side. So what they did is they crafted this series of rules that said that
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.440]   you have 24 hours to list the house electronically and to put it into these portals that they have
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.640]   set up where they've carved the state of Missouri into four areas or the country in 880 areas.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:26.160]   And if you don't put it in there, you're not allowed to list on the MLS. 90% of the houses
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.400]   in our country are sold on the MLS. And then what we started uncovering and we introduced evidence
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.440]   to the jury and you kind of, at your core, you knew this, but we proved evidence. We saw the
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.840]   emails and the training on this. What their agents are trained is to scare home sellers into,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.840]   look, if you don't pay the buyer's agents commission, no one will show your house.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.400]   And if they don't show your house, your house will go stale. People think something's wrong with it.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:50.960]   ISKRA: Right.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:57.280]   MCLURKIN: And so they scare you. And then there's this whole concept called steering. And steering,
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.960]   a lot of your listeners may be familiar with it because it has this kind of racial history. And
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.360]   ironically with the national association of realtors had a real bad history with a lot of
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.040]   the racial problems we had in housing, but it used steering people away from certain neighborhoods is
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.760]   what people think of, but steering is used by buyer's agents who refuse to show houses where
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.840]   the commission is not being paid. And if you think about it, it kind of makes sense. If you're a
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.320]   buyer's agent, you're going to want to work where you're getting paid. There's nothing like this
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.680]   evil for the buyer's agent. But what's happening is half the time, these corporations on the real
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.560]   estate, these big, large corporations like home services and Keller Williams and Remax and
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.640]   anywhere you name them, half the time they're making their commissions selling houses and half
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.000]   the time they're making their commissions buying. So they've created this little club.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.720]   ISKRA: Yeah.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.760]   MCLURKIN: They're taking the money from the homeowners. They're giving half of it over here
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.000]   to the buyer's agents. And then half the time they're benefiting on their side. And it's just
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.040]   trading this money back and forth. And I really think that the last four and a half years, what
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:12.320]   I've learned about this case is what's unique about this is we just don't buy and sell houses enough
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.400]   where you become accustomed to it. It's not like a car versus life. You're probably,
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.920]   you know, if you're lucky enough, you're going to own many cars. People might get a new car every
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.360]   six, seven years, but houses, maybe two houses in a lifetime. And that lack of knowledge
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:37.840]   creates this uncertainty. And then also what happens is there's so much paperwork and there's
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.640]   so much inspections and all these things these banks do that, that, that makes it kind of like
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:50.000]   mystifies it. And so they use that to their advantage. But the reality is that we don't,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.760]   I mean, buyers agents are really by and large, a thing of the past. And it's hard to say it.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.000]   It's tough to say it because there's a lot of really nice buyers agents, but, but, but,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.280]   but look, they just are. And when I, you know, when I first started practicing law back in
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.320]   1990, 30 some years ago, if I had to travel for work, I would use a travel agent. Remember travel
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:19.440]   agents? And if, if you wanted to book a plane or hotel, you'd call a travel agent and he or she
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.240]   would, would book a plane for you. They charge you 10%. We don't use that. We use Orbitz or we
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:31.200]   use Expedia or we go directly online. Imagine now if every time you went online, if the national
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:38.320]   travels association sent you a bill, I mean, that's what they've done. And it's just,
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.800]   it's shocking. You know what we did, and I thought it was one of the cooler ideas that we had. My,
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.640]   my partner, Ben Fadler, who's just this brilliant attorney who I work with. And he's,
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.600]   he's got some really, he's got real common sense about him.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.360]   The national association realtors, they did this report. They called it the danger report.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.040]   And they looked around the world where you don't have the, you don't have the MLSs.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.080]   And they looked and they said, look, we don't have buyers agents around the world. And I
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.840]   identified Australia as a country where the commission's between one and a half, 3%.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:11.520]   So Ben and I picked up the phone and we started calling agents in Australia. And we, we found one
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:18.160]   of them to come as an expert witness. We flew him to Kansas City, Missouri, and he testified to the
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.560]   jury. And I remember the very first time I talked to him, his name's Todd Reynolds. And he was a
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.560]   great dude, is a great dude. And I said, Hey, I was explaining what we were doing. And he's
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.960]   explaining, well, we don't have buyers agents in Australia. And he actually asked me, he said,
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.240]   do you not have the internet in Missouri? And I said, we have it. He said, well, why would you pay
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:45.520]   somebody to find you a house? Don't you, can't you go online and look at videos and do? And so he
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.640]   came to trial and testified to the jury and they loved him because it's just, there's just a better
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:56.800]   way. There's just a better way. And it's no knock against buyers agents, but it's like feeling
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.480]   sorry for the people who used to sell me movies at Blockbuster. I mean, they have to move.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.240]   And if somebody wants to go and spend in Missouri, houses, aren't as expensive as they are around the
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:16.720]   rest of the country, but on average houses here, $300,000 house, a $9,000 commission.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:25.600]   We reviewed 130,000 transactions over a seven year time period in the Kansas City area. 98.2%
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.960]   of them were at 3% buyers commission. I mean, that's stunning evidence of price fixing.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   And the other thing too, I mean, and I know you know this because I've been thrilled after you
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.480]   reached out to me, I've been listening to your podcast and the level of expertise that you have,
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:49.280]   and you're got some very savvy listeners. It was stunning to me because I was a major in philosophy
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:56.080]   and finance wasn't my background, but when I actually calculated it and had an expert calculate
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:03.760]   it, it takes an average homeowner seven years on paying their mortgage down until they just have
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:10.480]   paid it down enough to pay that 3% buyers commission. So what we explained to the jury was
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.400]   this teacher we had, we had a single mom and had two boys when she first started her life
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.920]   down in Springfield with her house. By the time she went and sold her house,
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.600]   she'd been there 10 years and when she was moving out to South Carolina and she went to sell her
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:33.040]   house, the agents who were involved in the sale of her house and the buyer side took 42% of the
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:40.400]   equity out of the house. It's not just 3%, it's 3% of the cost of the house, but it's not 3% of
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:47.360]   your equity and it's just because they're getting away with it. They're getting away with it.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.320]   That's why they're doing it.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.640]   Let me ask you this. I think you make a great point regarding people
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.520]   not familiar with buying and selling homes, maybe twice in their lifetime. They're scared to do the
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.680]   wrong thing. They're scared to have a stale fish listing. They're scared to lose money.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:09.920]   Do buyers not know that the 2.5% to 3% commission the buyer's agent earns is really the 2.5% to 3%
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.520]   of money out of their own pocket because they could have negotiated a lower price
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.120]   because if they didn't have that commission.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.520]   No, in fact, what they do is the National Association of Realtors and these real estate
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.320]   companies forever, they're training agents, buyer's agents to tell buyers it's free.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:37.120]   It's free. If you go on Zillow and people don't even know this, but if you go on Zillow right now,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:43.280]   go on zillow.com and do a search and it populates in Kansas City, it'll populate 7,000 houses for
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.800]   sale. Every single house on Zillow is a house that's part of this system because the National
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.200]   Association of Realtors has a rule. It's called no co-mingling when Zillow or these aggregators
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   like realtor.com or Zillow, or Trulia, when they get that information, the only way they'll feed
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:08.160]   it to them is that they refuse to put it in there for sale by owners or people who are not members
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.840]   of NAR. When you click on that, you click on a house in Zillow and then you go to an agent and
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.360]   the agent says, "I'm not going to charge you anything." You think this is the greatest deal
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:23.920]   ever, but you're right. It's baking it into the cost of the house. If I'm trying to net out a
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:31.600]   house of a $300,000 house, I'm willing to pay $9,000 for a seller's commission, but I'm trying
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:38.720]   to net out $290,000. If I didn't have to pay the buyer's commission, I'd drop the cost of my house.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.920]   Right. Or everybody wins. You drop it a little, the buyer saves a little,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.000]   the agent still earns this listing fee of 2.5%, 3%.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.480]   Or what ends up really happening, and this is what they're terrified of,
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:22:02.320]   is if I have to write a check as a buyer and if you're doing a $500,000 house, am I ever going
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:09.520]   to give somebody $15,000 for helping me go over some paperwork that my bank is going to insist
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   that – I mean, you think a bank is ever going to loan you $500,000 for a house without making
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.800]   sure that you have inspections and making sure that you have a free clear title? No,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.200]   they're never going to – what they're afraid of is that people are going to get in there and
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.120]   realize it's not worth what they're paying. That's why they fought us. That's why they had
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:37.840]   200 lawyers from the largest law firms in the country that they just tried to crush us,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.240]   because they know what they're doing here is fundamentally wrong, and they're just desperate
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.360]   to get away with it. Right. Well, let's play devil's advocate a little bit here, because I've
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:59.040]   seen some decent arguments where it says, "Well, the buyer, if he or she had to cut a check to pay
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.560]   the buyer's agent, then he or she would find it even more difficult to afford a home."
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.640]   So what would you say to those people? I'd say – well, I would say it's hogwash,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.360]   and that's a legal term I guess I learned in law school in the Midwest.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:20.400]   Why in every other country in the world that the National Association of Realtors looked at,
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   that's not true. In the UK, Singapore, Germany, I mean, Australia, across the world, it's not true.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.040]   That's number one. Number two, what buyers then would do is they would pay for what it's worth.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:43.200]   And the second thing is first-time homebuyers, what we forced their – they had a former HUD
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:49.520]   executive come in, the director of HUD, come in and testify on the defense side. He's part of
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.520]   the corporate real estate world now. And I made him admit on the stand to the jury
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.440]   that every single state has something like a Missouri. It's called the Missouri Housing
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.040]   Development Commission. It's a first-time homebuyers program. And I don't know if your
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.200]   listeners know this, but every state has it. It's something you ought to do a podcast on sometime if
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.680]   you're not familiar with it. In the state of Missouri, for families that are making less
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:20.800]   than $140,000 a year, you can get up to 4% of the value of a $400,000 home. And as long as you live
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:28.640]   there for seven years, you never pay it back. And they are actually having difficulty giving this
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.720]   money. It has to be a first-time homebuyer. You have to meet the income qualifications,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:39.040]   but $140,000 for a married couple, and that's 4% of the value. And one of the reasons they're
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.800]   having a hard time giving the money away is because buyer's agents don't even push people
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.160]   in that direction. Because –
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.280]   I've never heard of it.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:53.840]   Right. And type in any state and look at – do you like the state name,
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.560]   Housing Development Commission? And housing advocates started pushing this years back,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.080]   and it's very prevalent and very common. So that's for first-time homebuyers.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:07.840]   And the second thing is that what would happen is buyers would realize that they don't need to do
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.120]   that. Because really what's happening is every one of our clients we had, who I met with, and all
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.800]   the documents we went through, because we went through all these documents, I mean, millions of
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.560]   different transactions. They're almost all on DocuSign now. And so any of your listeners who
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.440]   have purchased a home recently, some of them will never maybe even meet their agent because it's all
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:38.560]   on DocuSign. And here's another radical point that I made at trial. Well, look, if you can't afford
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:46.800]   something, well, then don't buy it. I can't afford to go to a nice dinner when I'm first out of
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.640]   grad school. It doesn't mean I go and sit down next to you and make you pay for my meal.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.440]   I mean, so if somebody truly has difficulty paying for the buyer's agent, and the second
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.960]   thing that's just disturbing to me at my core, one of the single most important financial decisions
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.480]   you do is when you buy your house. If you don't have commission, like in Missouri, if you don't
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.520]   have four or $5,000 to pay for commission, then you ought to rethink whether or not you're going
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:18.400]   to get your house. Because what are you going to do then when your air conditioner goes out or you
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:24.800]   have a leak in the roof? I just think it's a bunch of scare tactics that are designed to try to scare
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:32.320]   people. And I really believe that. I just don't think any of that's going to change. And houses
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.360]   are still going to be very readily – prices are going to come down. And all we're going to see is
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:44.320]   that these corporations are making less and less money. And look, agents are nervous about it,
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.360]   but I call it corporate real estate for a reason because what's happened is when this came along,
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.480]   companies like Home Services, it's Home Services of America, it's a Berkshire Hathaway,
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.840]   Warren Buffett company. They started going in and these big Wall Street
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.920]   corporate real estate brokers started gobbling up the local mom and pop real estate companies.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:11.760]   And so that's why we are not dealing with local agents. The local agents were not even defendants
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:17.040]   in our case. It's the corporations that sat at the top. And what they're doing is they've
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.280]   literally gone in and just gobbled up – Home Services has gone across the country and
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:27.760]   methodically gobbled up all of the local real estate agents in different cities and towns and
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.520]   states across the country. And the reason they're doing it is because they were pulling out
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:37.840]   billions and billions of dollars a year in these commissions. It's going to change. I mean,
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   I believe at the minute this verdict came in, we filed a new nationwide lawsuit.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.480]   And if they want to change their ways, they got a chance to sit down and have a conversation.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.280]   But if not, if they want to keep fighting like they're fighting, then we'll just continue to
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.960]   hobble them to their knees and hold them accountable across the country because this
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:06.000]   is what's happening here is wrong. Yeah. How long do you think it'll take before
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.760]   real estate commissions materially decline, you think?
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:19.840]   Unfortunately, I think it's – Even if tomorrow, if the National Association of Realtors stop
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:25.360]   this illegal behavior and let's call it what it was, the jury found it's illegal price fixing.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:32.400]   If they stop this illegal behavior, it's going to take a while for it to change. I would think
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.920]   10 to 15 years maybe. 10 to 15 years.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.200]   You know, it's hard to think mentally it will change.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:39.700]   Okay.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:46.240]   But as far as where people – where it just doesn't happen anymore, because it is so baked
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:54.320]   into our culture that people think it's just a 6% commission. I mean, it's just something that I
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:00.400]   always just thought, "Well, that's just the way it is." It's almost kind of like it's Americans
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:06.560]   just think, "Well, that's just what we do. We just pay that." To change that mindset when they've
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:14.240]   ingrained that pattern of behavior into us for so long, they're going to hang on to it as long as
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.280]   they can. Interesting.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.560]   Are you familiar with the game called Whack-A-Mole? Have you ever heard of that?
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.280]   Yes.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.760]   Yeah. Right. So anybody who has kids, they were talking about – You know,
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.600]   your young children – When my children were younger, we used to take them to Chuck E. Cheese
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.320]   and they'd play Whack-A-Mole. For your listeners who aren't familiar with this, a little mole will
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.720]   pop up out of 10 different holes and you hit it, then another one pops up. This has been a game of
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:43.680]   Whack-A-Mole with this industry forever. I think what I told the jury was that we want to unplug
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   the machine. They're going to keep trying to plug it back in. They're coming up with new creative
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:59.120]   ways to try to stop it. I think that this really is the first shift. My hope is that in my lifetime,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.320]   that we'll look back and this will be a thing of the past.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.780]   Yes.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:12.640]   When I'm over at some people's houses, this doesn't happen very often, but you're at someone's house
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:19.280]   and you see a phone that's hanging on the wall with a cord, right? We don't really remember when
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.720]   they – when it changed. When did we quit having those? But at some point, we did.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.360]   Yep.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.960]   So that's what I'm hoping is going to happen here.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:34.640]   I think it's going to be faster than 10 to 15 years and I think it's because of you and your team.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:42.000]   I think we're underestimating the speed of change because after your verdict, your win – because
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.320]   I was talking to a real estate agent a month ago and she was like, "Well, what do you think? Should
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.120]   I list your house at this 5.5% or 6%?" I said, "I would like to wait until this verdict comes out
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.960]   before I talk to you." So now when I'm going to go back, I'm going to talk to her and say, "Hey,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.520]   what do you think about this verdict? It does seem like there is some price fixing going on.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:05.120]   How about 3.5%? How about 4% and not 6%?" I'm going to ask right away and I hope any seller
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.560]   who's thinking about this asks right away.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:15.360]   Sure. I probably answered a question that wasn't really asked. What I was meant is,
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.960]   I think within 10 to 15 years, we will no longer see buyer's agents.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:26.640]   So I think we will no longer see that. I really think that that's going to be a relic of the past.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:32.960]   But as far as open negotiations and commissions and all that, I think that
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.360]   significantly faster than that. I do agree with that. But also, unfortunately, and one of the
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:46.240]   beauties of programs like yours is we got to keep this fresh, but the public tends to have a
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:53.280]   relatively short attention span. And this isn't the most, it's not like the sexiest, most interesting
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.400]   topic out there, right?
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.080]   Oh, this is pretty sexy, Mike.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.920]   I mean, to people like me, it is, right?
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.600]   No, this is the most amazing topic I've come across recently.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:08.960]   But it's one of those things where they're really desperate to hang on to this. And I don't know,
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.320]   maybe it seems like this case has been going on four and a half years and they're going to try to
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:21.440]   drag it out on appeal. But I mean, look, I'd like to see a change tomorrow. I mean, I've called upon
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.840]   the new CEO of the National Association of Realtors to sit down with me and to sit down with
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.560]   me and to sit down with federal regulators, the Department of Justice, housing advocates,
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:38.800]   to come with a spirit of contrition and a spirit of willingness to bring about true change.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.680]   If they want to do that, that's what I want to do. Get this money back to the people it was
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.200]   taken from and find a path forward. But right now, all they've shown is a desire to continue
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.760]   to fight, which is okay. I'm a scrapper. I'm a fighter.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:33:00.560]   Well, so once you won the verdict, you filed a new motion to sue other companies,
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:07.440]   other brokerages. Right. A new lawsuit. So given that there's precedence that you won this massive
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.440]   trial, it seems to me as an observer, casual observer, well, you're going to win again
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.840]   because all the information is out there and you guys fought for four and a half years and you have
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:24.880]   all the evidence and the documentation and the witnesses. What are your thoughts on going forward?
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:30.800]   Yeah. So I think the other companies kind of recognize that as well. But what people want to do,
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.240]   and I think a lot of these corporate real estate companies, they just want to throw money
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:40.240]   at it to make it go away and not change the way they're doing things. And we're unwilling to do
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:47.920]   that. We've got a team of attorneys that maybe we're all kind of true believers. But until we
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:57.200]   can get the National Association of Realtors out of the business of allowing their system to be used
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:05.440]   to force homeowners or even to allow them to make these offers of commission to the buy side,
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.720]   I don't think anything's going to change. And so there's two sides of a lawsuit. There's the
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.960]   money side and there's what's called the injunctive side, the change side. And we're not
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:25.680]   just going to take a payout and let it continue as business as usual. And I think that we've made
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:32.400]   some folks on their side believe us because they tried to get us to go away before trial and we
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.840]   wouldn't do it. And these cases are very, very seldom for these antitrust cases to be tried.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.920]   Someone told me this is the largest antitrust verdict in the history of the country. And very
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:49.360]   few of these cases go to trial because there's so much money at stake. But to me, this isn't about
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.560]   the, it sounds weird for a lawyer to say it, but really, I mean, I believe that this isn't just
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.200]   about the money. I mean, the money's a piece of it, but it's not just about the money. It's about
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:05.920]   the need to change their behavior. And until they're willing to fundamentally change the
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:11.120]   way they're doing things, I don't see this lawsuit going away. I don't see the new one going away.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:20.640]   And so, I don't know. David reached into his pocket and pulled out a stone one time and we've
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.960]   got some more stones and we've got bigger pockets. So we're going to keep swinging.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.760]   (00:36:15): When you talk to the regulators,
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.640]   I guess the government officials, folks looking at anti-monopoly, what do they say? Because again,
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.280]   to me, it seems obvious that there's an issue.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.560]   (00:36:25): So the department of justice has got an
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:47.040]   extremely dedicated, smart team of attorneys that they work in the antitrust division. And one of
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.280]   them sat through the opening statement, sat through the closing statement. And these are men and women
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:59.760]   who devoted their lives in the real estate area and to antitrust. And there's been a real difficulty
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:07.120]   trying to hold these folks accountable. And I think there's a real sense of excitement and joy
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:15.520]   because now we know that you can take complex, complicated problems, but explain it and distill
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:24.240]   it down to where juries understand it. And I think that they fundamentally want to see change here.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:33.040]   And I feel that there's a real kindred connection with our trial team because they have lawyers on
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:43.120]   our side that we want to see real change as well. I feel like I went to law school, so I had the
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:52.720]   chance to make a difference in people's lives. And what an awesome, cool way to do it. I mean,
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.600]   class actions get a bad name all the time, man. I used to personally hate class action lawyers and
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.400]   think about that they're the people, the men and women who are giving coupons and taking hundreds
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:09.680]   of millions of dollars in fees. And I think that this is a chance for us to show that that's not
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:16.800]   what it is. It's a way when Americans, when the system, when a lobby becomes so strong and
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:25.040]   powerful that you can't get real change in DC. And you can get ordinary citizens, ordinary Missourians
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:31.600]   to band together and pull together a jury under the Seventh Amendment. I mean, it's there because
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   people fought and died for a bill of rights and to get them together. And for two and a half weeks,
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.080]   the most powerful men in real estate, and I'm using that word intentionally because that's
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:49.520]   exactly who it was. It was men in real estate were called to the stand in Kansas city and held
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:55.520]   accountable for their conduct. And they looked at what happened and they said, stop it, knock it off.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:06.240]   And that's why I went to law school and heady fun stuff. And so we'll do it again if they want us to.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:12.720]   Now, I mean, I really think it's great as an outsider looking in. I like to complain against
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.640]   the government a lot because of the inefficiencies, the $500 paperclip example, all that fun stuff.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:24.080]   Is this a failing of the Department of Justice to not do what they should have done? So private
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.480]   citizens like you and other lawyers step in and you know, Missourians, juries.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:34.560]   I never want to say it's a failing of the Department of Justice because I think that
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:41.200]   the Department of Justice has some really tremendously talented attorneys and there's
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:48.160]   a tremendously talented folks. But look, it's all part of the executive branch and there's
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:55.120]   always politics and there's all kinds of politics at all different levels. And it is much easier
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:01.200]   when we're making a decision on our trial team, we've got, you know, I'm the lead trial attorney.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.120]   I take input, but I make the decision, I make the call. And it's a much more efficient way
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   to make a decision about how we're going to act and what we're going to do. And it's a lot easier
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:21.920]   to massive undertaking to take on a trial, millions of documents, almost $10 million out
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   of pocket expenses to litigate this case. You know, all kinds of, you know, 10,000 plus hours
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.480]   of time. I don't know the amount of time, probably 20,000 hours of time of attorney time.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:41.360]   But ultimately it's something that we were able to do and that's far easier than it is to get a
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:52.800]   piece of legislation through the house. Far easier than it is to navigate the intricacies, I believe,
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:59.760]   of the department of justice. And that's why we have private rights. That's why the Sherman Act
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:06.880]   exists because if for whatever reason, I don't know if it's politics, if it's efficiencies,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:14.880]   if it's whatever reason, but for whatever reason, if the governmental entities don't take down
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:19.200]   monopolies that collude, the private citizens have the ability to rise up and do so.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.320]   Got it. Wow.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:26.480]   And that's what happened. And it is a really cool thing. I told the jury during closing argument,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:32.080]   I mean, this is just a jury of normal folks. I said that the most powerful seats in the courthouse
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.360]   were the ones that are sitting as this big, beautiful, epic courthouse with an article
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.720]   three judge who's just a tremendously talented, brilliant man who's given his life to serve on
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:50.000]   the bench and all of the power and the magistrate of that courthouse. But the most powerful seat
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:59.280]   was the truck driver and the nurse and the substitute teacher and the retired person
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.560]   from the park department. I won't go through all of their careers, but these are just real people,
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:09.840]   the stay at home mom. And they were sitting in seats in a criminal case, life or death,
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.880]   and in a murder case. Someone goes to jail for the rest of their life or they walk free.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.360]   And in this case, you had the most powerful corporations in the world.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.720]   They can either hold them accountable or they could tell them to give back
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:28.800]   $5 billion of money that they wrongfully took. And that is a cool thing about our country.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.920]   If we can figure that out and we allow that to happen, why are we the only country in the world
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.960]   that pays 6% commissions when the rest of the world pays 1.5%?
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.160]   Right.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.000]   It makes no sense to me.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.080]   Change is coming.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.280]   It is, man.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.400]   It is. And really, thanks to you. I'd love to understand more about the economics of being
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:55.440]   a trial lawyer, a personal injury lawyer, a lawyer such as yourself. How did the economics work?
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.560]   Because you said almost $10 million out of pocket.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.040]   To win this case over four and a half years, tens of thousands of hours.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.960]   How do you pay for that? How do you pay for that? And what if you lose?
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.760]   Well, yeah, it's a...
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.720]   What if you had lost? Are you just out $10 million?
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:20.480]   Yeah, that's exactly what it would be. So we've been blessed. We've got a small firm. It's my
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.360]   best friend from law school and one of my really good friends who I met who was a defense lawyer
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:33.520]   down here, my son, the four of us. And we've had a lot of success. Four years ago, well, I guess
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:39.440]   the first big case I had was in early 2000. I had a case that went to trial that resulted in a
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.280]   multi-billion dollar verdict. And it was a pharmacist who was diluting chemotherapy drugs
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:54.640]   and killed about 1500 people. But we've had a lot of success over the years. And we've decided
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.720]   when we're doing that, that we're just going to invest in causes we believe in.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:05.440]   And the economics of it are that you, in a case like this, the reason this costs so much money,
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.320]   unlike a traditional personal injury case, which can be expensive, but the reason this case is so
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   expensive is the data. So we had to collect all of the data in these giant data dumps
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:28.480]   where you'd have 260,000 transactions coming from multiple different brokerages.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:35.760]   And it would be very jumbled and difficult to understand and figure out. So we hired a team of
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   statisticians and economists and their expert witnesses. And that's where all the money comes
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:48.880]   from. I think they spent 10,000 hours on just expert witness time. And I remember when I first
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:57.840]   got involved in this and I got my first bill, and a brilliant, brilliant professor from Texas A&M,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.040]   Dr. Craig Schulman is his name. And he's a brilliant antitrust bind. And he's just,
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.560]   he's extremely bright. And Professor Roger Alford, who used to be in the antitrust division
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.800]   with Donald Trump. But when I first got my first bill from these expert witnesses,
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.760]   and I opened it up, it was $1.7 million. And I just, I'm like, okay.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.120]   Then I guess at that point you're just kind of pot committed.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.560]   Pot committed.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:29.200]   But yeah, had the trial come back and if the jury had ruled against us, we would have,
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:35.840]   that money would have been gone. And we had for the last four and a half years,
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:41.600]   this is the only thing that my firm's worked on. And the other people I've worked with, I mean,
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:48.240]   this has just consumed all of our lives. And that's, you know, but you try to put that out
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:56.400]   of your mind because it can be kind of soul crushing if you don't. But that's the nature of
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.080]   it. But like in a traditional, if you just think about it, and people, you know, people knock
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:07.600]   lawyers all the time. But if you think about it, like two of my closest friends in the world are
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.720]   lawyers here in Kansas City, they were just trying to case over in St. Louis, Missouri for a police
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:21.680]   officer who was paralyzed and it's a quadriplegic from a horrible car, from a roof crushing on a
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.840]   car. Second case, they've taken a trial and it's resulted in, they called a hung jury where the
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:36.400]   jury couldn't resolve it. And they just, they don't get paid. But what you do is it, I think it
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:42.960]   increases the quality of cases because I wouldn't be filing cases and spending money and doing
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:47.600]   things like that if they were frivolous or if they were, first of all, I wouldn't do it because
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.080]   you should be filing frivolous cases, but you're not going to do cases unless you believe in them.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.720]   And isn't that just the essence of the free market? That if you have somebody like me
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:04.000]   and my team that's willing to invest our time and money and effort into this, hoping that we
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.120]   could prevail at trial, then we're going to work harder to get the story across, to define the
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:16.080]   evidence, to uncover the evidence, to invest in it, to put the best case forward. And so that's
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:23.120]   the economics of it. But it's, I'm not sure what coach said it, but it's certainly true in litigation,
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.880]   it's better to win than to lose. So.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.080]   Sure. So you've won, however, I'm sure the defense is going to appeal.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.200]   Sure.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:37.280]   So does that mean it could take years and years for you to actually collect a percentage of the
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.560]   winnings? And so there's no pot of money right now.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:47.120]   Nope. That's correct. And even when you win, it's not automatic. We keep track of our time.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.080]   And it's one of the things I actually explained to the jury because a lot of people don't
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.760]   understand this. Maybe a lot of your listeners don't understand it, but it's not like this
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:58.160]   happens and that money's wired into, even when we collect and win, the money's not like wired
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.840]   into some bank account in my law firm. When it happens, the money goes into the court,
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.320]   it's supervised by the court. We actually have to file a fee application with the court.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.520]   We have to show the court the time that we spent, the money we spent, how we spent it.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.480]   And we have to ask for the court's approval and permission to be paid anything. And it's
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.720]   all subject to the oversight by the court. And that happens in all class action lawsuits,
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:26.080]   which is different than a typical personal injury case. But, so we won't, at the end of the day,
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.960]   there won't be any money that's paid unless we win the case. The money's been collected into
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.720]   the court system. We file a motion, a hearing's held, and the court approves our time and expenses.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.880]   And so that's how all that happens.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:46.480]   Is there no, okay, you guys won the case. The defense have to pay at least the legal bills that
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.560]   you've incurred so far?
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:48.800]   Nope.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.440]   Nothing.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:49.680]   Nothing.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.640]   Wow. So it's really a gamble of conviction.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:04.720]   Yeah. Yeah, right. It is something where you really need to believe in it. But yeah, it could
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:11.360]   be, and massive undertakings like this are harder. Big class action cases are harder. But you're
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:21.040]   right. But it has to, you know, you ride it out until the end. And then ultimately, the goal is
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:26.960]   to refund the money to get the money back to the people who it was taken from. But yeah, that's
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:32.240]   how all that works. And that's true. Almost any case you hear, anytime there's a jury verdict,
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:39.040]   the lawyers are always doing that on a contingent basis. And he won't get paid unless they recover
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.480]   money for their clients.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:45.840]   Right. That's amazing. You know, offline, we were talking about kids.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.480]   And you talked about your son being born during your first case. Can you talk about that a little
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.080]   bit and how that affected the case and how it kept you going?
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:06.960]   I'll never forget it. My son, Steven, back in 1997, when my wife was in the hospital getting
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.120]   ready to go into pregnancy, and the doctor walks in and I'm reading this book, it's called
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.640]   "Trying Cases to Win." And he kind of looked at me, he's like, "Do I have something to be
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:22.880]   worried about?" And Steven was born. And a week later, I went and tried my very first trial.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:31.280]   I was 32 years old, and I had never stepped in front of a jury before in my life. And it was
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:40.560]   kind of a wild, wild thing. I had started my law firm in 1995. And for two years, we didn't make
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:45.280]   a dime. I mean, literally, we didn't bring one dime in. And I decided at that time that this
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.840]   is the most logical time for my wife to get pregnant and for us to start our family.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:57.360]   And we were in our new house. And so we went to trial, and thankfully I won.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:05.920]   But then I had my daughter shortly after him in '98, and I never pushed law on either one
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.000]   of my kids. I always kind of tried to stay out of the way and let them do what they wanted.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:16.240]   And ironically, they both ended up wanting to go to law school. And my daughter works for legal aid.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:23.840]   And my son is an attorney now in our firm for the last year. And he poured his heart into this case.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:32.960]   It was a really cool thing to be there at trial. And I was talking about both my parents in their
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.680]   80s watched every day of trial. But I'd look there and my son's sitting there, and my parents
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:44.240]   are there, and my daughter would come and watch, and my wife was there. And it provides a lot of,
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:50.640]   to me, it provides a tremendous amount of source of energy and a tremendous source of drive,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.880]   which you need, right? Because I think I was functioning usually on an average of three or
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:03.200]   four hours of sleep a night. But it was cool. It was fun. And he was a tremendous gift in this case.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.520]   And thankfully, he gets a lot of his smarts from his mom.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.680]   [laughter]
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:15.600]   So let's say we fast forward, Mike, I don't know, four years from now, let's say it's finally over
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:22.480]   and you win and you collect, let's say it's not a 1.8 billion, but it seems to me that the final
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:31.040]   settlements generally are less. I'm not sure why. Let's say it's $200 million. And let's say your
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:36.960]   firm collects 30% of that. What do you do? What do you and your partners do with that windfall?
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:43.520]   What are some things that come into mind with that type of life-changing money, which maybe
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.960]   it sounds like you were able to have that windfall in the past?
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:53.920]   Yeah. Unfortunately, and that just shows you the difference in concept and scale, but I would view
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:52:00.560]   that kind of more as disastrous because if you think about it, by then we'll probably have been
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:06.400]   carrying a bank note on our client cash, we call them client cash advances, money we've paid out
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.000]   that we're paying interest on. We've been carrying it by that point for probably seven or eight
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:17.280]   years. And I guess it might've amassed $20 million. And then you're also, we're supporting
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:22.160]   our internal structure and salary because people have to live, right? I mean, we have attorneys.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:29.200]   And so typically what firms like mine will do is you'll run up a line of credit and you'll go to
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:35.600]   a bank and they'll loan you money. And so people look at that and they think, "Oh, geez, you go and
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:41.200]   you collect, you made 25 or $30 million." Well, no, I actually didn't because I had to pay back
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:50.160]   30 million. And so there's that business side of it. But what you end up doing when you do,
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:58.560]   if you do get a large amount that's collected, everyone's indifferent. What I try to do is
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:09.600]   stay grounded and stay focused on the fact that I personally have seen money screw people up more
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:15.680]   than I've seen it be something that's beneficial to them if they're not grounded in it, right?
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:24.960]   And it can lead to false hubris and things like that. So I just stay grounded and reinvest it.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.280]   And then find the next case that you want to throw your money into and you want to throw
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.160]   your time into and throw your... But also there's a big team of people that are associated with it,
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:42.240]   other teams and so it never goes as far as you think. People hear about like the... We had
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.760]   that pharmacist had a $2 billion verdict on, but your numbers were right in that case.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.320]   I think at the end of the day that maybe our firm ended up making like $20 million,
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.600]   which would seem like a tremendous amount of money. But after you paid off,
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.760]   you did everything else. I mean, nobody was... We weren't buying yachts and planes, I'll tell you
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:13.440]   that. You do that, but I don't know. It's a passion. It has to be a passion to grind that
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:19.600]   long to not know whether you... To grind that long without making any money and to know that
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.640]   you could lose. That is an unbelievable passion. It's very respectful.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:31.840]   But it's thrilling too. I mean, I'm not going to kid you. I don't want to act like it's just like
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:37.760]   Atticus Fenske and Killmonger. There's a tremendous amount of charge that there's
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.880]   a tremendous amount of adrenaline, a tremendous amount of... I'm not a guy who likes to gamble,
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:49.760]   but man, I tell you what, when that jury's out in this case and that jury's deliberating and they're
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:54.960]   coming back in that room and there's probably 300 people and all eyes are on that jury and
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.800]   they're going through and they're only answering five questions. I mean, you want to talk about,
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   that's a stand up on the edge of your seat kind of moment, and it makes you feel fully alive and
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:15.360]   it makes you feel... It makes you just embrace the beauty of your craft. Oh, yes. Based on this
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:21.120]   verdict, I'm assuming people are emailing you and knocking down your door asking for representation.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:26.960]   How do you deal with the publicity and the inquiries or is it just you have to focus on
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:31.600]   this real estate price fixing situation for the next several years?
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.200]   I let it get to my head and realize that I'm the same idiot that I was the day before.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:47.760]   I mean, you're the same person and try not to let it get to you. And I'm staying focused on it.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:56:00.640]   There's a lot of unfairness, I think, in life and I see parts of it. The more success I've had
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:07.840]   as an attorney, and so I've, thankfully I've never lost a trial and I've never had a verdict
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:13.040]   less than a million dollars. And I've had a lot of really big verdicts because we work really hard
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:17.200]   and we do really well. But the more success you have, the easier it is to be successful.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:24.960]   And it's weird, but just like with your podcast, when I see the people who are on there,
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:29.600]   when you get bigger gets and then your audience grows and it's easier to get people. And so the
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:36.240]   same thing happened with me. And what I have to remind myself of is don't get too full of yourself.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.000]   Hey, but you know what? I know why you're so good at what you do because you're very easy to talk
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.960]   to. And where are you located at? We're in San Francisco. So it's a big deal,
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.040]   big prices and big commissions. Yeah. Actually, I spent a fair amount of time
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:57.520]   out there taking depositions because the Anywhere, which used to be Realogy's,
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:02.400]   had a lot of their folks based out there and they used one of their big law firms
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.240]   was located there in San Francisco. But I was going to tell you, when you get out here to the
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:11.760]   Midwest, I'd love to take you out to some real Kansas City barbecue and get you to
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.200]   the Kansas City Chiefs game and let you see how real football is played.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:23.440]   I'd love that. I love Kansas City barbecue. It's the best. I would love it. Mike, thank you so much
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:28.640]   for your time. I really enjoyed it a lot and I'm looking forward to hearing this and you have a new
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:33.280]   fan of me. I'm definitely going to start following your podcast. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.720]   Take care of those kids. Bye-bye. Take care.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:41.120]   I hope everyone enjoyed my interview with Mike Ketchmark. It was scintillating to hear him speak
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:47.680]   about how he was able to battle Goliath and win. And for those of you in the real estate industry,
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:53.600]   this is not an indictment on you by any means. I know many of you are good folks. This is just
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:59.760]   about change and how technology and capitalism forces change and has forced the commission
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:07.440]   structure in almost every single industry closer to zero, if not zero. Change is inevitable and
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:14.080]   we've got to change with it. Also, shout out to Financial Samurai reader and fellow author,
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:18.800]   Jimmy Soni, who wrote the book, The Founders, The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:25.520]   Shaped Silicon Valley, for introducing me to Mike Ketchmark and enabling me to do this interview
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:31.040]   for all of you all. Thank you so much, Jimmy. And if you enjoyed this podcast episode, I'd love a
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:37.200]   share, a positive review. It's what helps the show grow and it keeps me motivated. So thanks so much.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:42.800]   Finally, if you want to keep in touch and know everything that I'm writing and recording,
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.960]   please subscribe to the Financial Samurai newsletter at financialsamurai.com/news.
