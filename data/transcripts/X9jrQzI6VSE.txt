[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.760]   Well, this is a very significant day for the obvious reason that the Legacy Standard Bible
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.280]   translation is finished.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840]   Does that feel like an accomplishment?
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.680]   Are you getting some sleep?
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.320]   I think one thing that could be said is to do this entire translation in a year is just
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.640]   really unheard of.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.160]   The second thing that can be said is I don't know that there's ever been a translation
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.340]   done by one faculty.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.360]   And I think that would almost be required if you were going to do it in a year because
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.760]   you couldn't be fighting theological battles along the way and come to consensus.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.040]   So I see the Lord's hand in this.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.840]   So it's a wondrous thing the Lord has done in His providence.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.200]   And then as I was saying earlier, the fact that we were given the privilege to do this
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.640]   from the Lachman Foundation, who have the rights to the NAS, and they let us put our
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.360]   hands and hearts and minds on that most honorable translation and make changes.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.200]   That was very generous on the part of the Lachman Foundation.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.060]   What stands out in my mind is the common theology among all of us and the common commitment
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.080]   that we were going to translate with authorial intent.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.120]   We were not thinking of the reader.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.040]   We were thinking of the writer.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.820]   I don't know that you would have expected years ago that this would have ever been done.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.500]   You'd have been a part of it, but the Lord knew who He needed.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.800]   And I just thank you and commend you.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.880]   And I've seen the Lord's hand in this clearly.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.920]   And I think we're about to see not just His hand in the process, but His hand in the usefulness
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   of this.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.000]   And you've gotten a lot of feedback from outside readers, right?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.720]   What number of people, just give me a general number, of people have been reading the translation
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.440]   as you've been working on it outside this group?
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.920]   Yeah, we're looking at an approximate range between 50 to 80 people outside of this group
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.380]   reading the translation.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.840]   And they would be qualified by being skilled at handling the Word of God in the original
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   languages.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.360]   So you're getting not just a lay opinion, but you're getting a scholastic reading and
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   opinion.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.960]   So that played a role in the finished product.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.680]   But it passed inspection by all of us, right?
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.680]   That's right.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.400]   So that's just wonderful.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.920]   The past six months or so has been spent primarily on the Old Testament.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.880]   What can readers expect when they see the Old Testament, they begin to read it?
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.840]   What's going to make this different?
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.920]   What's going to set it apart from other translations?
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.840]   Maybe I'd ask you, Joe, since you're kind of the Hebrew point man.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.560]   Yeah, the past six months have been just terrific.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.200]   And Abner and I worked on it very intensively together.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.360]   But I think that the philosophy of translation goes across the board, New Testament and Old
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   Testament.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.200]   And so I think that when we think about the way that we translated the Old Testament,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.920]   we sought to be literal, to be consistent, to be precise.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.120]   And so in the end, when you look at the entire product, you're looking at a refined accuracy.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.280]   NASB was great, but you're looking at something that was refined and where those elements,
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.440]   consistency, precision, those were intensified in this translation.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.840]   And you can think about an example maybe from Exodus.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.280]   Consistency is something that we've talked about a lot.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.640]   But I think the other side of the coin is that we try to distinguish words in English
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.320]   that were different even in Hebrew.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.780]   And so you think about the narrative of the Exodus, and we know that God hardened Pharaoh's
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.480]   heart and that Pharaoh hardened his own heart.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.680]   And we remember the word hardened very familiarly for us because it appears so many times.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.200]   But in the Hebrew, there are different words for the word hardened.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.560]   And so we sought to bring that difference out when we translated it.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.200]   And so you have God hardening Pharaoh's heart with firmness.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.480]   And then you have God hardening Pharaoh's heart with stiffness, just like the stiff-necked
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.240]   people that we're familiar with.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.720]   And you have God hardening Pharaoh's heart with strength.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.840]   And all of those are differences that bring out the fact that Pharaoh's heart was hardened
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.560]   from different perspectives.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.960]   So it was really hard from various elements.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.760]   So it sort of brings out the progression in the hardening of his heart.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   Yes.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:24.580]   It brings out the progression as well as the wholeness of the hardening that Pharaoh had
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.040]   towards the people of Israel.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.440]   So if you think about the firmness, God hardened Pharaoh's heart with firmness, it's like a
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.360]   rock that you can't penetrate and that you can't move.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.820]   You think about the hardening with stiffness, it's like he's set in his ways and he's moving
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.380]   in a certain direction just like the stiff-necked people.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.640]   You think about the hardening with strength, and that's his proactive intent to be determined
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.000]   to move into a certain direction no matter what happens, no matter what the consequences
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   are.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.200]   So you get this element of emphasis by seeing the difference of the hardening that he experiences.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.600]   And we would say that every word was inspired by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.080]   So the Holy Spirit was communicating something in those different Hebrew words that hasn't
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.520]   up to this point showed up in an English translation.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.760]   That's exactly right.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.800]   And I think seeing this difference brings out exactly what the Holy Spirit intended
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.720]   within the text.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:30.360]   And we also, I think, would be doing well to answer this question.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:39.880]   How much of the NAS that you started with did you find that was good and accurate and
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.680]   could be retained as opposed to how much new in the Old Testament?
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.000]   I think overall NASB is a great translation.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.560]   It's a solid translation, which made it easy for us to work with because we appreciate
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   it.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   You mentioned that.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.560]   Absolutely.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.560]   Going back to the original language.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.200]   So everything we didn't change, it's actually our seal of saying, "We affirm this.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   This is correct.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.640]   This is good."
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   And the tweaks that we made, the alterations that we made only enhanced consistency and
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   accuracy.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.120]   Another one that I think of is in Isaiah where we are familiar with Isaiah 6 that the Lord
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.520]   is on the throne high and lifted up.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.020]   And throughout Isaiah, that pairing of words is used.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.000]   But it is used in a way to show that people are not high and lifted up.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.820]   They have eyes that are high and lifted up, but God will lower them.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.300]   They have a heart that is high and lifted up, but God will humble them.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.800]   In Isaiah, there's only one who is high and lifted up, and that's God on the throne, and
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   then the servant.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   Isaiah 52.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   Isaiah 52.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:54.140]   And so having the consistency of the language of high and lifted up throughout Isaiah demonstrates
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.980]   that in the end, though people want to be high and lifted up, there is only one, and
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.500]   that is God and His Son.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.840]   So those are the kinds of things we try to bring out with consistency.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:12.480]   And for expositors, which all of us should be, because preaching the Word of God is what
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:20.500]   we're called to do, this is critically important, because you can't explain the Word of God
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:28.060]   unless you have it, and you have it accurately, which is exactly what we've endeavored to
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.440]   do.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.240]   The reading of it, is it fair to say, will sound a lot like the NAS?
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.400]   So people who've been familiar with the NAS, it's not going to be a big jump, not like
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.300]   even going to the ESV or back to the King James or the RSV.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.640]   They're going to feel the familiarity of this.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.960]   It feels very much like an NAS thing.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.600]   And I think that's a big thing, Paul, because as a preacher who has preached from the NAS
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:08.760]   for years, I couldn't shift to something that was too different, or I'd be quoting things
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:16.800]   from one translation and reading things from another, and never the twain would meet in
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.960]   my mind.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.800]   So I think that's a question that's going to come up a lot.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   I've preached from the NAS for years.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   Can I make the shift?
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:39.000]   I know a pastor down in Florida who has already made the shift and has ordered the LSB in
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.040]   the form that it's available now, New Testament Psalms and Proverbs, and he's got it for his
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.240]   entire congregation, and he's preaching from it.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.520]   And he's made that shift, and he's absolutely enthusiastic and excited about the shift.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:59.480]   I can think back, when I came out of seminary, it was at the time that I came from seminary
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.400]   that the NAS first appeared.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.280]   I graduated in '64, and there was a version of the NAS sometime around that time, then
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.480]   later the '77 and then later the '95.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.520]   But the guys that were teaching me, Dr. Feinberg and Dr. Thomas, were the main guys on the
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.280]   Old and the New Testament.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:29.600]   So I had always used basically the King James, and I was used to it because I'd memorized
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:37.640]   it growing up, and I wondered if I could make the shift, and obviously it was right at the
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.840]   time that I came to Grace I started preaching from the King James and made that shift early
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.000]   on in my ministry.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.080]   I only say that to say you can do it even when it's a little more difficult.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.640]   This will not be that difficult.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   - Yeah, people say to me, "Oh, it just reads like the NASB."
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.280]   And they think that that's some kind of derogatory statement, and I think of it as our greatest
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.960]   victory because it affirms what the NASB is, and it's our affirmation that you can trust
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.720]   your Bible translation.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.400]   And it takes a lot of work to make changes in a way where it still sounds exactly like
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.760]   the New American Standard.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.320]   And as we've already said, if there is a change, it's for a reason.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   There's a reason behind that, not just a preference issue, but we're trying to justify something
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   in that way.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:35.160]   - Sometimes you guys actually jumped back past the '95, back to the '77, and back to
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:44.080]   the '71, and picked up a previous original translation, so you were faithful to the original
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   translation.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.240]   I mean, there are examples of that that you can think of?
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   - Yeah, the simplest one is in Mark with the conjunctions.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:59.720]   So one of the things that a lot of people responded to, I was surprised, and in a pleasant
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:06.880]   way, is they said, "Put the conjunctions back in, in the Gospels, and in the epistles of
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.880]   the New Testament."
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.960]   In the '95, I tried to smooth things out by removing certain conjunctions.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:20.200]   And we know that Mark is characteristic, or a characteristic of Mark is the repetition
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   of conjunctions.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.760]   It's a fast-moving narrative.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.440]   And the irony is that we talk about and immediately, and immediately, and immediately, and oftentimes
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.760]   in the New American Standard, the and might not even be there.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.120]   So we put those things back in, so that we're going back to the '77.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.800]   - I mean, that's the integrity of this translation.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:52.280]   So when you delivered this to various readers, give me some examples of where they may have
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:57.000]   come back to you and said, "We think this could be better done this way," or, "We think
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.200]   you need to think about this."
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.920]   Obviously, you told me one time on a single weekend, you had been given as many as 1,500
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   suggested changes.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.920]   - That's right.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:15.600]   - And I'm knowing you, I'm sure you went through all 1,500 of them.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:23.280]   So how did you decide, did you re-inject the discussion back into the committee?
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:29.880]   - Oftentimes, sometimes a suggestion was a typographical error, and I knew everyone was
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.400]   going to say, "Yes, you should spell that word correctly," so I didn't need to ask them.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:41.560]   But there were times where either we knew that the person didn't have the whole context,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.800]   and if they had the footnote, or if they had the whole context of what we were doing throughout
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.680]   the entire Bible, they would have come to a different conclusion.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.640]   But there were other times where, and a significant amount, where we needed to have a broader
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.800]   discussion, and so I would give the whole team a list of, "Here are all the questions,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:07.320]   and please write down your comments," and they would faithfully, every morning, do so,
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.200]   and we would compile that and figure out a decision together.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:16.040]   - And I think there's an example that comes, which actually came from a Hebrew scholar.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.760]   He said, "How come you guys don't translate the expression cut the covenant as cut the
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.640]   covenant, and you typically translate it as make the covenant?"
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.880]   Which is what all of the other translations do, as far as I know.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.120]   And so we talked about it, and we thought, "Well, people understand if we translate cut
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.160]   the covenant as cut the covenant," which is exactly what the Hebrew has, and so we thought
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.880]   about English expressions, "You cut a deal," and so we thought, "Okay, we could actually
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.200]   use that and introduce it into the translation," and so we did.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.520]   But it also has theological and exegetical implications.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.640]   You see the image of cutting the animals and then walking through the animals, and it's
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:15:00.000]   used in contexts where that image is of cutting the covenant, and you get to Jeremiah 34,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.080]   for example, and there the language of cutting the covenant and cutting the calf in two,
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.640]   and then walking through that calf as part of the commitment that you're making to the
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.480]   covenant is all within the same verse.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.480]   - Like Abraham in the book of Genesis.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.680]   - It's exactly, you get that image in Genesis 15, you get the same language in Jeremiah
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:25.000]   34, 18, but the scholar said, "Use the same language that the Hebrew has," and so we did,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and it worked.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.280]   - Yeah, and it really, it solidifies the theological implications.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.920]   There are even wordplay, David and Jonathan cut a covenant with each other, and the idea
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.280]   is we are going to cut a covenant so that my offspring will not be cut off, and you
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.320]   can hear the pairing of that language there.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.400]   It would be lost in translation if we didn't do that.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.680]   So reviewers had a lot of helpful and insightful comments.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.320]   - But it's also the integrity of the translation because that's what it says.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:07.520]   So when I was a student in seminary, Dr. Robert Thomas was the translator in the New Testament.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:15.560]   The question comes, can you share one or two principles of translation that he taught some
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   of you?
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.880]   - I think we said Dr. Thomas' middle name was Precision, and I think that's something
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   that he really impressed upon me as a student was to be very, very precise, to account for
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:43.800]   every feature of the Greek text, and he wouldn't allow you to come in below that standard,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:50.200]   and so I think that was very important, and I think he shared some lessons about where
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.880]   he thought the New American Standard really shined as he translated it, and kind of the
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.680]   word-for-word correspondence, making sure people had basically the Greek text in their
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:08.200]   language, and that kind of philosophy I thought was very, very helpful in how we do our philosophy
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   here.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.040]   - Yeah, he started out his college days at Georgia Tech, and he was an engineering major.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.160]   He had that kind of engineering mind, and precision was really important to him.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:23.480]   - Yeah, I think an example of that, I think, coming from Dr. Thomas' investment in us,
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.260]   but I'm thinking of 1 Peter, one of those words is fear, that many translations stay
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.800]   away from, because it has certain negative implications, and I was comparing the New
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:41.320]   Testament, the NASB rather, with the LSB, and sometimes the word is always phobos, it's
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:49.000]   always fear, multiple times, but sometimes it's respect, respectful, reverent, but the
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.040]   root word is the same, and to soften some of the implications, for example, when the
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.520]   women are expected to be respectful to their husbands, and so instead of putting fear there,
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:04.240]   even though fear really implies directed towards God, and a fear for God, this is how you interact
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.320]   with your unbelieving husband in 1 Peter 3.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.080]   So we went all the way back, instead of the consistency, the precision of the original
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.640]   text is fear, but I also think beyond just the immediate passage, you go through the
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.080]   whole book, and it says, okay, if the context is persecution, you need to live in a certain
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.720]   way that demonstrates your respect for God, and your fear for God, more than fear for
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.680]   man, who can harm you, and remember who you're ultimately to fear.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:38.840]   Yeah, and I think in doing that, you also expand the meaning of fear.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:47.320]   It can be explained as respect, but it's a component of what it is to fear God.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.200]   You love God, you fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell, Luke 12.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:01.400]   That's different than coming to Him for comfort, but all of that is embodied within what the
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.280]   Bible would say is a correct fear of God, which is the beginning of all wisdom.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:16.840]   So yeah, sticking with the purest translation, as you have done, I think is the key gift
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:22.360]   that this translation gives, and that's why I'm kind of pushed on the idea that probably
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:30.320]   90% of this LSB will be like the NAS.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   But the 10% is really significant, and it was grappling with that.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.680]   Can you give us some other illustrations of where a literal translation helps the expositor,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:50.520]   where without that literal translation, somebody who didn't know the original would not be
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.960]   able to get to the correct interpretation?
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.120]   I think this even goes back to what we were just saying about Dr. Thomas, about precision
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:05.520]   and about literalness, and it not only relates to things that seem theologically significant,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.040]   but to words that seem completely simple.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.940]   And you can think about the word temple in the Old Testament, the way that it's translated.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:18.320]   You see it appearing all throughout the Old Testament, and you go to Ezekiel, you see
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:25.560]   that God's glory departs from the temple in Ezekiel 10, and you understand what that
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.560]   means.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.360]   But when you read Ezekiel 10 in Hebrew, it says that God's glory departs from the house
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.400]   of Yahweh.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:39.760]   And so the word temple actually is the house of God from which His glory departs.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.360]   And then you think about that word in light of the entire Old Testament, you remember
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.120]   what was David doing?
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:51.680]   He was building a house of God, a house for God, for God to dwell in, because he said,
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.720]   I already dwell in a house, I've built a house for myself.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   But God doesn't have a house to dwell in.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.520]   When Solomon builds the temple, he is actually building a house for God.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.660]   When the exiles return and they're rebuilding the temple, they're actually rebuilding the
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.120]   house for God, for Him to dwell in.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:16.400]   And so you see this simple literal translation, which we have in the Legacy Standard Translation,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:24.160]   but you see the word for temple or literally for house in Ezekiel 10, because it represents
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:30.200]   God's presence as it did from the very beginning until Ezekiel 10, when God's presence departs.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.360]   And if you go to the latter part of Ezekiel where it describes God's, the new temple,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.320]   it also is the house of Yahweh in which God will dwell.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:50.160]   Another example I think of is in Isaiah, again, it's the word council and the nation's council
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:57.200]   and the king has counsel and there's counselors and all of that is maintained in the Legacy
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   Standard Bible.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.000]   But in other translations, it might be they have advice, they make plans, they come up
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.920]   with schemes, but we maintain council, council, council all the way through because of the
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.120]   infamous passage, the famous passage, I should say, which is that our Lord is the wonderful
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.000]   counselor.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.560]   And the reminder is kings will counsel, nations will counsel.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:28.600]   There will be counsel taken amongst many advisors, but there is one wonderful counselor and his
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.840]   counsel is that which stands and overcomes all other kinds of counsel.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:39.080]   And so it's those kinds of things where, again, an English reader might not be able to make
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.360]   the connection because it is a little bit hidden with the translation.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.840]   We've tried to bring that out.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   - Yeah.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.920]   I think word plays, especially, are really helpful to try to help the reader see the
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.520]   authorial intent.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.800]   One instance that I can think of is boasting in Romans.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:03.120]   Romans has this idea of boasting oftentimes has a negative connotation, right?
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:10.480]   You can't boast in your works, boasting in the law, that faith excludes boasting.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:17.160]   And yet in chapter five, you have this kind of cool connection, I think, a really helpful
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:24.120]   connection, and that is oftentimes it's translated rejoice or exult.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.880]   And we decided to continue the same terminology and use boasting.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.260]   So in Romans five, we boast in the hope, and we boast in our afflictions, and we boast
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.240]   in what God has done for us.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.540]   And so I think that helps the reader just in those five chapters follow this flow of
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.720]   thought that says, "We don't boast in and of ourselves.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.800]   We don't boast in people.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.200]   We boast in God and what He has done."
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:56.960]   So that allows the term "boast" to be something good if you're boasting for the
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   right thing.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.960]   Yep.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   That's right.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:06.080]   But again, all of this comes back to the whole point of doing this, and that is to get back
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.640]   to the original.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.160]   And I think people listening to this conversation have to be saying, "Well, why didn't other
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.980]   translators do this?"
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:20.140]   Because not doing this has obscured these things.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:28.180]   So what you all have done is you've unwrapped some packages that have been wrapped up, and
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.820]   now they're unwrapped.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:37.940]   Is this the kind of thing that the reader will be able to pick up just in reading the
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.940]   text?
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.940]   Yeah, I would say so.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.500]   I think it's not just seeing the consistency that we've talked about a few times now.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.500]   It'll pick up.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.220]   I'm spending some time in 1 Peter these days, and so it's fresh on my mind, but I
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.980]   think of the word "conduct."
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.180]   We consistently translate it on the strophe as "conduct."
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:02.060]   But in the previous translation you have behavior, you have way of life, and you have conduct
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.060]   as well.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:09.440]   But when you see conduct in various contexts, so the context of always be walking or live
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.820]   your life in a way, so make sure your conduct is always out of view for God.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.500]   Even in your relationship with employers, or in your relationship in the household,
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.980]   or in your relationship with unbelievers when you evangelize, 1 Peter 3 for example.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:27.140]   The word "conduct" keeps appearing in multiple contexts in the book to show that there's
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.620]   a consistent approach to your life, and that it always is to be excellent and God-honoring
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.860]   and done in the fear of God.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:39.540]   So I think anybody who sits down and reads, I would say, a book in one sitting or multiple
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:44.180]   sittings, if they pay attention, they'll see that there's this repeated term, and hopefully
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.460]   they'll pause and reflect, "Okay, if this is the same idea here, then maybe God expects
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.020]   a consistent conduct out of me in every single context."
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:57.860]   One of the things that you do if you're a writer, at least what I've done through my
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.740]   whole life of ministry and writing, is keep a thesaurus handy so that I don't use the
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.540]   same word all the time, but I'm not inspired.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.020]   So a translator doesn't need a thesaurus.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.740]   You don't want to be looking for another word, that's what you're saying.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.060]   It's almost the opposite principle.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.420]   Yeah, it's the opposite.
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:23.020]   You want to get the thesaurus out of there.
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.780]   I don't want to overstate this, but this simplifies.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:33.380]   It takes unnecessary complexity out of it, because if words are different, people assume
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.500]   concepts are different.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.260]   If words are the same, then the concept is the same.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.780]   So that is a huge, huge gift.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:48.260]   I was going to say, I think part of our exegetical method is to make sure that we pay attention
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.260]   to repetition.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.420]   So if there's repetition of the same word, whether it's in the same verse or in the same
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.900]   paragraph, for us it's a big deal.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.820]   So that's where the preacher comes into the picture and says, "I need to explain to you
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.940]   why somebody would say, 'Don't fear their fear.'"
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.940]   Why would you repeat the same word?
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.340]   It almost doesn't make any sense in the English, but it's because it's a quotation from the
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.940]   Old Testament, literally.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.980]   And now he's trying to say, "Pay attention that the only person you should fear is God,
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.980]   not any humans."
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.900]   And so I do think, answering your previous question, Pastor John, that there's an element
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.620]   where the preacher has to get into the picture and say, "Okay, let me explain why it's the
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.620]   same term as opposed to a synonym."
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.420]   Well, yeah, Will, I'm sorry.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:34.820]   John, you asked if—can the English reader of the LSB pick up on the differences in the
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.980]   Greek?
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.780]   And I thought right away of James 2:14.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.820]   The LSB says, "What use is it, my brothers, if someone says that he has faith, and faith
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.480]   does not have the article there, but he has no works?"
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.500]   And then it says, "Can that faith save him?"
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.980]   That second faith has the article in front of it.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:02.020]   It's referring back to the kind of faith that does not have any works.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.380]   So I think we're correct in saying, "Can that faith—can the faith that I've just
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.900]   spoken of that has no works save him?"
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:15.900]   And the rhetorical answer is, "No, that kind of faith can't save him."
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.540]   Rather than asking the question, "Can faith save him?"
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.540]   Because that confuses—yeah.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.540]   That's right.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.060]   That's why there's such a dilemma over that passage and why Luther threw it away.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:29.780]   Because faith does save us, but that kind of faith that I've just said that has not
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.780]   accompanied my works.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.340]   So I think the reader can pick up on that.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:38.980]   You know, my least favorite thing to do as a preacher is to fix the translation.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:39.980]   Do I hear an amen?
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.980]   Amen.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.980]   Absolutely.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.980]   Yes.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.100]   Because it makes you—the people listening thinking, "Okay, can I trust this?"
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.100]   Right.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.100]   Well, of course.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.100]   If you keep correcting it—
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.500]   And the further the translation gets from the original, the more you're fixing the
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.740]   translation.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:29:01.220]   And to fix the translation is to create suspicion and maybe doubt.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:13.440]   So just on a personal note, how has this year-long exercise impacted your personal life, apart
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:19.060]   from irritating your kids and messing with your schedule?
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:27.940]   What is the personal impact of this intensity toward the Word of God for a year?
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:33.420]   I just think it's rewarding, you know, as I think through just even being on the team
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.700]   with these men has been humbling.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:46.100]   And I think through—like, I feel like I'm always learning with them, a constant student,
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.940]   I guess, if you will.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:56.340]   And so I just think from a personal standpoint, just that learning experience and growing
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:02.940]   and knowing the Word more in depth and being appreciative of the translators before us
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.140]   and then also even these men here and the insights that they would bring.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:12.540]   And I just—sometimes in our meetings, when we would meet during the COVID shutdown, I
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.660]   was just like a kid in a candy shop.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.220]   Like it was just—it was so much fun to be a part and to glean from that.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.260]   And so I think that's one part.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.680]   And the other thing, too, as I think through it is that it's just a blessing to be a part
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:30.340]   of something that, Lord willing, outlasts all of us, that impacts the church.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.700]   But that's, you know, from my personal standpoint.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.600]   Yeah, for me, it was reassurance to trust the Word of God.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.660]   Because the deeper you go in grammar, the more reaffirmed you are in your faith and
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.720]   trust that this is God's Word.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.620]   It's not just man's.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:54.740]   Yeah, the only way you could come up with the idea that the Bible is open to any interpretation,
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:01.080]   as you hear the naive people say, or that the Bible is too complex to understand is
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.540]   when you don't understand it, when you don't read it.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.220]   But the deeper you go, the more cohesive it becomes, right?
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.780]   It just gets tighter and tighter and tighter, and all the loose ends disappear.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.700]   Yeah, walking away from this project, I just think, even what we talked about earlier,
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:23.020]   the consistency across the Testaments, what you just said, it gets tighter and tighter.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.620]   You walk away thinking this is God's Word, and I believe it, and I trust it, and I hope
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:33.180]   to have that same emotional, I would say, response after a year of study for the rest
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.100]   of my life, that nothing will undermine that trust.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.700]   Well, with the exception of Will and myself, you guys are going to have to figure out something
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:45.460]   else to do the rest of your life, because you've been to the mountain, right?
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.580]   You're like Moses, you got it.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.300]   You came down the hill, the glory's on your face, so what am I going to do now to get
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.100]   this people in line?
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.140]   John, you took the words out of my mouth.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.860]   I was just about to say, John and I can say, "Now, what are two old guys going to find
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.180]   something fresh in this?" and I can say, "Yes."
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:14.780]   Just the impact of the word Yahweh on my Bible reading now, there's a good shock value to
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.780]   that.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.780]   No question.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:23.180]   One of the questions that I was thinking about is, "Am I ever going to preach from this?"
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:29.700]   And just a while ago, I preached on Psalm 19, and you guys know Psalm 119, verses one
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.700]   to six.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.700]   It's about Elohim, God.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.140]   Heaven was declared the glory of God.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.620]   Then there's a shift in verses seven and following to Yahweh.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:47.960]   The natural creation of Elohim is spoken about, but the supernatural revelation in God's Word
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.820]   is Yahweh, and reading that, there's a shock value to it.
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:58.940]   I mean, yes, I think I could understand the law of the Lord, all capitals, but it reminds
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:06.420]   me that this is God's covenant name, and these are God's covenant scriptures, and I appreciated
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.420]   that so much.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:17.060]   - And this Yahweh name is his personal intimate name, and he wants you to know him that way.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.820]   Not as some category of being that gets a title, but of a person.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:28.860]   - Yeah, I think for myself, and this just echoes what everybody has said, the way I
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:34.860]   would describe it is, we as believers, we don't know the depth and the breadth of verbal
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:42.100]   plenary inspiration, but when you come out of a project like this, you realize the intentionality
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:48.820]   behind everything, things that often we might take for granted or just say, "Oh, it's coincidental."
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.020]   It's not, because we've had to struggle and wrestle through it, and in the end, we realize,
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:59.020]   no, there were deliberate choices, and everything was a deliberate choice, and it all matters,
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.780]   and there are just great moments of devotion.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:10.260]   I was remembering when I was translating Daniel 11 through 12, and the Hebrew word, which
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.700]   means to stand, is used throughout that chapter, and it talks about how the king of the north
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:20.740]   will stand, and the king of the south will not be able to stand against somebody, and
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:25.140]   the word stand, and stand, and stand, and how they cannot stand is said over and over
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:33.060]   and over, and then in Daniel 12, in the end, Michael, the angel of God, stands for his
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:40.220]   people, because he stands before his God, and now you know who stands in the end.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:47.860]   And I just read that, and seeing the consistency, I just worshipped, because it was so powerful
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:53.260]   to understand the thrust of this passage based on the consistency of the word choice.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:35:00.260]   And I think that's what makes the Legacy Standard readable, is because people can hear the repetition,
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:08.020]   and it stitches everything together in a cohesive whole, and that's what people have said makes
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.620]   the text so much more sensible to them, because they see how it fits together, and they see
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.620]   the theology.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.060]   It's powerful.
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.300]   - Is there value in reading it out loud?
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.380]   - Yeah.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:30.560]   - I find, even by myself, that reading the Scripture out loud is a blessing.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:38.540]   It's almost like it's not just a meditation, it's speaking to me, even though it's my own
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.540]   voice.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.560]   - Well, I think you're employing another sense, just seeing the word, but you're hearing it
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:51.620]   by your own voice, and perhaps then we're just more aware of how that word is working
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.620]   together.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:59.680]   - But I think also, when you're just reading it silently, you don't pronounce those words
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:05.860]   like stand, stand, stand, stand, you just kind of flow by, but when you say it, and
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:13.520]   I've noticed that I've been reading the Legacy Standard Psalms on Sunday morning, and it's
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:21.200]   very quiet, and what you said, Will, is true, there's kind of a stun that hits them when
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:36.280]   you say Yahweh, they're not used to that, but it gives them a whole new sense of God.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:44.600]   Do you have any particular things that you do differently with poetry or narrative?
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.080]   - I think people think, oh, narratives are just easy, they're just a story.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.480]   That's true, they are a story, they have a plot, they have characters, and it's all historically
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:00.560]   true because it's inspired and inerrant, but stories are complicated, and bringing that
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.760]   out is hard.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:09.920]   So one of the books that I think Joe and I struggled the most was Ruth, not because the
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:15.760]   Hebrew's difficult, but to capture everything that's going on in the narrative with the
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.880]   consistency of it, it can be tricky.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:28.200]   The beginning, it says, "May Yahweh grant you, give you blessing, give you this," and
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:34.440]   it's a wish, it's a prayer, and then in the end, "And Yahweh has given these things,"
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:42.480]   and so there's this symmetry, what you prayed for, now you receive, and there's even language
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.520]   of gathering, there's different kinds of language throughout Ruth, and to get all of that symmetrical
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.760]   so people can see the contrast and the buildup, it's difficult.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.760]   Esther was another one.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:58.240]   Esther, okay, Ruth and Esther, they're very hard, 'cause Esther has this great irony that
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   comes out.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:06.600]   How do you have, it begins with the king of a pagan land, it ends with Mordecai as a ruler.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.880]   There's just this huge reversal that takes place, and you see it.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.340]   There's an edict that goes out and is reversed, and then in the end, there's an edict that
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:21.160]   goes out that is going to be reversed, and there's even this word, I think we translated
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:28.360]   "reached out," and so it reached Esther's turn to go before the king, it reached her
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:33.520]   time to appear, it reached, it reached, it reached, you have reached royalty for such
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:38.920]   a time as this, and then when she appears before the king, she reaches out to touch
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   the scepter.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:45.120]   So there is this providential unfolding that happens surrounding this word.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.120]   But now it sounds easy, but to figure out a word that kind of stitches all those things
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   together.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   - Coming up with "reach out."
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was hard.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.920]   But that's the richness of a narrative under the inspiration of the Spirit, and there's
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.280]   a theology in it.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.720]   It's a great theology of providence.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.960]   - So there's some challenges there.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:17.000]   Well, again, profound gratitude, and the world is going to discover this translation soon,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.120]   and to move them as fast as we can, we're going to have Shepherd's Conference in March,
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   March 9 through 11, 2022, and at that Shepherd's Conference, there will be the premier edition
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:37.760]   of the entire Bible given as a gift to every person who's there, and so you will have the
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:45.140]   original autographs of the LSB, first edition, if you're a part of the Shepherd's Conference.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:51.720]   So that's when we know it'll be ready to go, and then there'll be different formats, but
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:56.000]   we'll make sure that we introduce it and feature it at the Shepherd's Conference, and we'll
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.240]   also major on emphasizing the glory of the Word of God.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:09.600]   God, Psalm 138, 2, says He's exalted His Word equal to His name, and so that'll be the theme
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   of Shepherd's Conference.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   - Amen.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   - Amen.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   - Amen.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   - Amen.
