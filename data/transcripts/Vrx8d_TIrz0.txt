[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   does anybody have any thoughts on this i mean i think it's incredible um
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.080]   so does friedberg's dog
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.440]   rain man david sacks
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.780]   and it said we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.740]   love you guys
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:33.020]   hey everybody hey everybody welcome to another episode of the all-in podcast it's been a week
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.960]   it's been a minute with us today of course the queen of quinoa david friedberg and the rain man
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.000]   himself calling in from a nondescript mansion in one of 17 cities the rain man himself david sacks
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.440]   and cackling like a dictator who got his two billy back
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.720]   you guys are welcome to another episode of the all-in podcast it's been a week it's been a minute
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.360]   and he's back in the game chamath palihapitiya for those of you he's re he's re-billionized
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.320]   he re-billionized is he gonna get a car with doors that go like this doors that go like this
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.480]   let's talk a little bit about the vaccine biden says everybody who's an adult is qualified by
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.460]   may 1st he's instructed the states to do that we are now hitting uh 2.x million a day we had a
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.000]   three million shot day i believe friedberg
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.720]   and uh obviously the 1.9 billion dollar covid slash uh everybody gets a big slice uh bill got
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.360]   passed 1.9 trillion with a sorry that's what i said 1.9 trillion no somebody put 1.9 billion
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.900]   in the notes yes 1.9 trillion uh 1.9 billion is what the covid um the covid nft went for
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.000]   the covid nft went for one as i said in the past a trillion here trillion there
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.660]   soon enough it's real money yeah yeah well biden biden's speech really kind of begged the question
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.120]   of why is it that the nft is going to go to the nft and the nft is going to go to the nft and the
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.340]   why we still need this two trillion dollar bill if covid is going to be over in may but putting
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.900]   that aside i think biden's speech was very welcome in that he called for states to drop all these
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.040]   crazy eligibility requirements that are actually preventing people from getting vaccinated at this
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.540]   point he says that every adult american should be able to get a dose by may 1st and he's right and
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.160]   you know there's a sharp contrast with gavin newsom in california who keeps playing political
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.820]   games with the administration of the state and the state of the art and the state of the art and
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.020]   administration of these doses. So in California, yesterday, just yesterday, we added 250,000 more
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.280]   doses of unused inventory so we the amount grew to 4.5 million unused doses sitting on a shelf,
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.460]   only 215,000 people got vaccinated. So we're actually building inventory faster than we're
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.600]   building the population of people getting vaccinated. And it's because of all these crazy
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.100]   rules and requirements, you have to go make an appointment, you know, and that really actually,
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.300]   it's kind of productive, because it discriminates against people who are less computer savvy,
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.680]   don't know how to navigate the website, or, you know, communities who don't want to enter their
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.180]   name in a government database, which, you know, there's a lot of people in California don't want
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.260]   to, you know, put put their names in a government database. And so it works against those communities
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.580]   getting vaccinated. At this point, we should just drop all the requirements, drop the website,
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.260]   let anyone who wants a vaccine just get in line and get vaccinated, it'll go much faster.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.380]   The problem is that we throw around this
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.120]   word equity, and that we need to do something with equity. And in fact, I think that people
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.980]   who use that word are stupid. I think what they're trying to say actually, is we don't want
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.160]   inequity. And the most inequitable thing is to actually take the most impoverished and fragile
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.840]   of the population and prevent them from actually getting the vaccine because they're the ones that
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.880]   actually need to be working, and can't afford to actually not work or can't afford to be sick or
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.660]   can't afford to, you know, find solutions to childcare.
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.520]   It's this weird word that like, you know, the extreme left uses now to describe policies that
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.120]   are just frankly, poorly thought out and even more poorly executed.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.760]   It might even be more pernicious than that, correct, Freeberg, in that anybody who gets a
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.560]   shot is helping everybody else because they are now a blocker in the system. I know this is
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.700]   incredibly simplistic. But I'm a simplistic guy. And it just seems to me that
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.660]   Well, it's a different way of thinking about the benefit of vaccination. And I've said it in the podcast, but I'm not sure if it's the same thing.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.660]   I'm not sure if it's the same thing. I'm not sure if it's the same thing.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.840]   I'm not sure if it's the same thing. I'm not sure if it's the same thing.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   I'm not sure if it's the same thing. I'm not sure if it's the same thing.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.040]   thinking about the benefit of vaccination. And I've said it in the past, but the benefit of
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.540]   vaccination is to get enough people vaccinated that the virus generally stops spreading,
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.700]   and then the pandemic ends. And that's the objective. It's not about creating equitable
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.480]   protection for individuals. And as Americans, it's interesting, we think about it in terms of
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.200]   an individual benefit. It's like, how much do I get? What do I get from this vaccine?
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.400]   I want to get protected, the other guys getting protected before me, who gets to go first,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.920]   yada, yada, and it becomes this kind of competitive, you know, frothing for a vaccination.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.660]   And the reality is, if we get enough people vaccinated fast enough, the pandemic ends.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.980]   If we can get 200 million shots in arms, this goes back to I think this tweet I sent in early
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.140]   January, December, we get 200 million shots in arms, we can be done with the pandemic based on
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.620]   how many the efficacy of transmission rate reduction, combined with the fact that a certain
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.700]   number of people have already developed immunity to this thing, we get to the point that there
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.460]   should be kind of a
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.160]   you know, think about a network, and you start turning nodes off the network suddenly becomes
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.720]   really hard to see transmission happen across the network. And, and so the prioritization of,
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.120]   you know, who gets the vaccine over, you know, how fast we are deploying the vaccine has been
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.640]   a critical error from day one, in my opinion. Now, look, all that being said, I feel like we
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.400]   could sit here and criticize and argue about tactics and strategy all day long about this,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.300]   and, you know, make politicians look like idiots and administrators look like idiots. But the true
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.440]   thing is, we're not going to be able to do that. We're not going to be able to do that. We're not
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.500]   going to be able to do that. We're not going to be able to do that. We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.900]   The truth is, we are now seeing 3 million shots a day. In Biden's speech, he said, which, if you'll
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.780]   remember, is what I said, we really should be targeting is about 1% of the population every day.
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.440]   And that's roughly where we are. Biden said in his speech that we are in a war footing,
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.200]   which is effectively what we said the other day, the federal government is operating 600 mass
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.300]   vac sites. And we are right now getting shots in arms for all of the issues with prioritization
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.420]   and nonsense that's going on. I feel very in the United States. I agree with you. I agree with you.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.100]   I agree that Biden has the correct posture on this, which is war footing. We are not doing that
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.760]   in California. I mean, I just talked about how we're building inventories faster than we're
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.900]   getting vaccines administered. Newsom just announced that 40% of the vaccines are now going
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.720]   to be basically separated out and reserved for equity zones. And you know, it's what does that
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.700]   even mean? It means that certain communities, only people in certain communities can get those
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.400]   vaccines. And they're going to be distributed out through this complicated system. And they're
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.120]   going to be distributed out through this complicated system of local community groups.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.420]   All that does is put money through some no-bid contract to some shitty technical company,
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.740]   a bunch of consultants that then take advantage of the system, get paid hundreds of millions or
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.840]   billions of dollars to do nothing. I mean, I tweeted out there's this bot that now scrapes.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.540]   And by the way, before I tweeted out this thing about this bot, which is, I think-
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.800]   Yeah, I sent it to you. It's the California vaccines available bot.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.380]   Exactly. And all it does is it scrapes.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.020]   It scrapes that myturn.ca website. But before that, in our group chat, there was another friend
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.060]   of ours who wrote his own scraper, if you guys remember. And it was really shocking because all
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.120]   it would show is page after page after page of completely open and available vaccine slots.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.620]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.120]   You know, at the Moscone Center and other places. And you think all of this stuff is just a bunch
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.720]   of, I'll be blunt, rich white people sitting in a room with their head up their ass. And they come
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.360]   up with these stupid fucking rules. And then they try to implement it. And they're like,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.240]   implement them with words like equity and all that happens is that you compound inequality
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:56.020]   and let's go back and let's go back to freeberg's first point which is that all these unvaccinated
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.000]   people who can't get vaccinated faster become a giant Petri dish for the virus that can continue
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.380]   spreading and experimenting on morphing and more things so maybe we actually do get a vaccine
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.120]   resistant strain the new strains the variants have been popping up so far are not a vaccine
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.520]   resistant but the longer the pandemic goes on the longer there's a chance that one could arise and
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.680]   then we're back to square one on this thing so it's going to hurt everybody um and and here's
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.200]   the crazy thing is that you know I think we all know a lot of I know dozens of people who've been
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.340]   vaccinated in California and they all come to me and tell me they're whispering about it you know
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.780]   because they don't want to tell anyone they're scared of being cancelled they're scared of being
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.880]   cancelled because you know um Newsom and and the equity people have created this idea that if you
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.100]   get a
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.840]   vaccine you're taking away from somebody else in reality you're not because anybody who's high risk
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.340]   has already gotten the vaccine by now or has had access to get the vaccine and all you're doing
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.020]   right now if you get the vaccine is taking a dose off the shelf where there's 4.5 million
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.660]   doses sitting there and it's increasing by millions every week and so what we need to do is
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:06.080]   um well let me make a PSA actually starting on Monday uh you could anyone in California can
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   get the vaccine with the doctor's note and they're saying that doctors have total
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.580]   discretion to give the note so let me just make a PSA to everyone out there if you're in California
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.800]   just go get a doctor's note starting on Monday and go get the vaccine yeah you know stop stop
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.200]   worrying about Newsom's stupid rules let's also just remember so two points on that not everyone
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.760]   has the ability to go just get a doctor's note it's really hard for people that have to go to
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.980]   public clinics and so on to get a doctor's note what we are seeing is a lot of people just hacking
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.060]   the website almost like Soviet Union era bread lines where they go to the website they type in
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.060]   something that's not true
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.740]   to get themselves a slot and that's how a lot of people are kind of filling the void the reality is
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.280]   and I just want to go back to the point I was making at the beginning I think we're skating
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.040]   out of this thing and I think that the inventory surplus which is absolutely being built up at a
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.360]   staggering rate in the United States right now if you look at the inventory forecast from J and J
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.460]   Pfizer and Moderna relative to the deployment rate of the vaccines right now you are correct we are
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.800]   building up a surplus an inventory surplus and the rate of buildup per day is increasing right now so
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.040]   one million extra shots
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.180]   a day two million extra shots a day being probably half a million to a million and so we're building
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.280]   up an inventory and so what happens of the 30 million we have we have already in inventory so
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.900]   so what's happening is there are natural Market Dynamics where what we are all pointing out and
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.520]   saying is starting to play out in terms of people kind of hacking the system there's so much supply
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.660]   there are many vac sites now you can go to any supermarket any pharmacy in California to get
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.860]   a shot and everyone's just clicking the box and saying yes I qualify and they're going in and
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.020]   getting shots so the market demand is starting to meet the supply
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.920]   even though there are government and regulatory forces that are trying to inhibit that from taking
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.060]   place and so I do feel pretty good when you look at kind of the inventory forecast and you look at
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.860]   how many shots are being given per day that in 45 days or so we're going to get to a point that we're
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.220]   starting to skate out of this thing and kind of call it can I ask you can I ask you a question
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.080]   despite the idiocy of the process that regulators have kind of put in place yeah I just have a quick
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.400]   science question because I I was trying to find the answer to this but I would love for you to tell us
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.000]   what is the real efficacy
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.060]   of the vaccine and what is your transmittability like your your carrier status once you've gotten
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:21.640]   for example like you know let's just say you take the the Pfizer vaccine right yeah if you
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:29.200]   get the Pfizer vaccine how many days until this is like pretty good and you know like what is really
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.820]   the risk profile between the first shot and the second shot I'll share this link and then we can
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.620]   post it on the um show on the on the show notes and people can take a look at it but it's an
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.980]   excellent paper published by the University of California at the University of California in the
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.300]   past and it's published in the New England Journal of Medicine showing basically a population of
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.800]   unvaccinated against Pfizer vaccinated with half a million in each population half a million people
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:55.340]   yeah and um yeah and they showed basically the accumulated infection rate severe hospitalization
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:00.800]   rate and death rate of each of the two populations over time and that really kind of I think highlights
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.600]   the efficacy of the vaccines and at what time period they become efficacious on each of those
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.960]   metrics and by the way even after the first dose across a population of half
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:16.380]   a million people the margin of error on death um shows that there may even be complete protection
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.200]   against death after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine uh within seven days of getting that shot
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.700]   pretty powerful statistic what just to describe the chart for those people listening you have two
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:33.300]   populations and ones in blue ones in red and it's the time is you know in days on the bottom axis and
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:39.000]   when you get to day eight one line goes sideways and the other one goes keeps going straight up so
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.740]   it's day eight after the Pfizer that you're basically protected according to this chart
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.200]   and that's on the first shot and like I think it adds like one or two cases yeah that's right there
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:55.260]   have been zero deaths so I think day eight is the day and the second dose seems like to me you know
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:01.020]   it's just this unbelievable extra another amazing chart which maybe we can dump in the show notes is
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.120]   what's happening in San Francisco we hit 10 000 shots a day at the end of February March 1st
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.980]   we're doing now 2 000 shots a day
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:15.340]   so we literally have dropped 70 or so we're at 3 000 shots I think from the peak yeah so this crazy
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:21.700]   wokeness is resulting in you know in this this virtue signaling that you know oh we can't give
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.540]   any shots to anybody unless we get this group first or that group first is now leading to
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.820]   everybody hacking the system the hack that I've heard is since teachers are getting it child care
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:36.460]   people and food service people are getting it people are now starting to get jobs at DoorDash
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.280]   or saying they're a teacher and if you check that box according to you know the back Channel that
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.740]   I've heard you go get the shot and you don't get they don't ask you for anything other than your
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.660]   driver's license no one's checking it's just a driver's license the pharmacies the grocery stores
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.280]   the mass vac sites the sfdph California dph administered sites the federal sites no one's
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.380]   checking you sign up you check a box on the website it says I attest that this is true and
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.840]   you go and show your ID and get your shot and so a lot of people have kind of initially started
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.860]   skirting around the rules by going to be a DoorDash driver for a day or what have you and
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.820]   then saying I'm a food and AG worker and then now generally people I think are just clicking on the
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.560]   box and going in and getting a shot now sorry just to go back on the previous question Chamath I
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.940]   shared it figure two uh Nick in this uh paper I shared particularly box E shows the deaths due
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.320]   to covet 19 of a vaccinated population a non-vaccinated population and then it shows
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.960]   a documented SARS Cov2 infection and you'll see that you basically have almost no incremental
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:44.080]   infections in the vaccinated population starting around 28 days after your first dose and so you
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.280]   know that's really when you could say you've got you know really good kind of protection from the
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.840]   vaccine and you're already starting to get the benefits early on antibody studies have also
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:58.480]   shown that there's this big jump up that happens around that period of time um and so call it three
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.260]   weeks after your first shot and then in particular the fourth week uh you're really kind of like
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:07.900]   locked in with a protective um you know capacity now your question around transmissibility is one
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.220]   that's still being studied which is if I've got a vaccine am I going to be able to pick up the virus
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.900]   and transmit it to someone else um right now you know they're saying well we don't have evidence
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.540]   one way or the other but I mean generally the way that the virus is spread is you develop an
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.920]   infection in your body your body then makes lots of copies of the virus and then you cough and spit
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.760]   them out in the air and that's how people get it so theoretically you could carry some virus on
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.200]   your mouth or on your nose where those cells
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.000]   don't have immune protectiveness and you know the vaccine the virus is still alive but it's not
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.800]   spreading in your body you're not creating a lot of superfluous virus to spread in the world so you
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.780]   know the basic science of it is you should not be spreading covid if you've been vaccinated right I
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.620]   mean you may have some on your skin or your nose or something for a short period of time but you're
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.520]   not going to develop a systemic infection that you're then going to kind of start exerting
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.960]   everywhere um so I think we should we should we should start to transition to this world of
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.140]   feeling really good and safe and enjoying ourselves yeah we hit five hundred
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:08.620]   thousand shots a day sacks in California and now we're down to 150 000. we've literally gone down
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:17.080]   two-thirds under the management of Governor hair gel it's yeah I mean because you know and and what
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:23.200]   was his in his state of this the state speech which went over like a lead balloon the the most
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.240]   notable quote was we're not going back to normal normal was never good enough normal accepts
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.080]   inequity so because there might be some inequity in the world
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.180]   around the wrong person in line getting these doses we're never going back to normal and he's
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:42.940]   basically ensuring that result by taking forever with these vaccines but let me let me um let me go
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.160]   back to to this point about efficacy so I think freebird gave the stats on look the bottom line
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.260]   here is that vaccines work that is the message we should be getting out to people is that they work
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.640]   and the thing I've been really surprised by in the reactions I'm seeing to my own tweets
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.020]   on Twitter about this is how loud the anti-vax voices are
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:08.200]   and how loud and sort of when you say anti-vax you you don't mean not take the vaccine you mean the
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.360]   vaccine doesn't work and we're never getting rid of covid the forever is COVID people yeah
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.700]   well there's no it's it there's there's actually a lot of people on Twitter who got really angry
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:24.520]   when I when I just tweeted um I tweeted something about how it's over Biden it's over I tweeted it's
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:31.960]   over you know um right Biden says we can all get the vaccine um in May if if you decide not to do
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:37.300]   it that's on you the rest of us are moving on and I got a lot of all I was really saying is look once
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.020]   the vaccine's available there's no need for any of these coveted restrictions anymore but a lot
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:45.640]   of people interpreted that to as me saying something that you should be forced to get the
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.900]   vaccine or something like that now look I don't think you should be forced to get it but I think
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:55.900]   it's highly effective it works and uh but I'm surprised at how loud these sort of anti-vax voices
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:01.900]   are it's usually like a conspiracy theory around around the vaccine and I think part of the reason
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:07.120]   those voices are are so loud is because they're unopposed because all the people who believe in
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.740]   the vaccine are getting it but they're all afraid of like like you were saying jcal of being canceled
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.180]   and so there's a conspiracy of silence around this you know what we all need to be saying is
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:21.520]   look go get vaccinated it works take the win America take the win we screwed this thing up
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.840]   for 14 months can we just take the goddamn win and move on I'll give you a I'll give
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.040]   you a little thing that that always pops into my mind and all of these things whenever I hear
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:38.860]   a politician or some like Naval gazing intellectual use the word inequity I think like this is a power
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:44.140]   grab because the word equity is really about ownership whereas the word equality is about
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:51.700]   balance right and and power hungry politicians love the word equity and inequity because it's
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.740]   their opportunity to grab power and to tell us how things should be done or to do things differently
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.540]   in a way where you know they can enforce their mandate which is typically ill-formed and not very
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:07.720]   strong um and I would just encourage all of us whenever you hear the word equity or inequity this
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.420]   huge huge red light should be going off in your head saying whatever this person says next is a
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.220]   crock of horse and it's probably a power grab whereas if you hear people really talking
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.200]   about solving inequality there's really no mechanism to solve inequality through power
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.120]   well I think that's a great point around the language that gets used and I have a similar
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.720]   uh concern about the way that the word privilege gets used we used to have
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:38.260]   a term in this country called success yeah people were successful or not and you know success had
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.540]   a connotation of being earned whereas privilege has a connotation of being unearned well I mean
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:49.360]   now sometimes privilege is earned success and sometimes it's unearned and you know but but when
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.640]   you start using the word privilege to describe all success it implies that there's something you know
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.800]   unjust or unearned about it it needs to be reallocated so you know I that to me is another
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.660]   one of these political words is we
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.440]   shouldn't be confusing success with privilege yeah they're two very different things I have
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:13.360]   an example of this Oprah Winfrey is successful Prince Henry is has privilege it's privilege
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.660]   it's privilege I shoehorned the uh Meghan Markle story finally I mean I do want to talk about the
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.320]   Meghan Markle story actually at some point before the end of this podcast but before we do that right
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:30.520]   now uh okay uh Joe Lonsdale actually also had a tweet um a pretty unapologetic set of tweets around
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.600]   you know the
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.800]   casting of this this concept of privilege and I thought it was really on point I really agreed
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.880]   with what he was saying and it's effectively what you're saying David it's like people right
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:46.600]   now I find are just so well not not people the people that take the time to wallow in Twitter
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.960]   um mostly at least as I interact with them um are just so bitter
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:21:01.540]   and I think that there is no um magnanimous happiness for other people's success anymore it it
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.880]   I think I think like we live in a culture now where everybody feels it is so zero-sum when it's
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:14.800]   not in fact zero-sum um and people just begrudge other people's success especially by the way when
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.980]   it's earned and the reason is because there's an entire generation of people of all different ages
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:27.760]   and you know but this this last five or ten years who tap themselves out now some were legitimately
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.500]   prevented from success but there's a lot of people that bought into this narrative of wow it's a whole
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.360]   conspiracy that's set up against me so I'm not even going to try and they are often the loudest
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.560]   and the most embittered absolutely um and and the reason is because you know everybody wakes
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.900]   up in their 40s and 50s and starts to rationalize their choices in their lives and what they really
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:52.540]   feel deep down inside is oh my God I just let an entire decade go by of blaming other people
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.980]   yeah and I think there's a surprisingly large amount of that
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:02.080]   this ideology of victimization doesn't teach people the right things because you start to
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.040]   think that you know if you're wallowing in your oppression then you don't have agency over your
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.940]   own life you're blaming other people for not being successful not getting ahead when what you should
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:15.940]   be doing is focusing on working and improving your own life and getting ahead or also just redefining
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.560]   what happiness means happiness doesn't mean what that other person has and then saying because I
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.540]   don't have that I have nothing happiness is really like introspectively figuring out like what really
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.380]   makes you complete
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:26.920]   it
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.940]   and I mean not to get too syrupy about it but it's like that's what we've also lost the script
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.560]   on so when you when you put all of these things together there's just a bunch of people that sit
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:41.020]   on the sidelines they either are too scared to enter the arena or they don't want to enter the
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:45.520]   arena they don't want the failure that comes from it because they've grown up in a culture where you
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.900]   know they had the kindergarten soccer ball handed to them the gold star and everything they've ever
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:56.740]   done participation trophy um and now what we really need are people in the arena more than ever folks
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:02.080]   who are trying and saw a problem and it's okay and there's just not enough of them what instead is
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.060]   there's just a lot of people who just want to and complain and I think this is the backlash to
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:12.640]   the Meghan Markle interview is is this miscasting that this is an extremely privileged person or you
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.100]   know Harry and Meghan both are very privileged and but but I think what they're trying to do by making
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:23.320]   all these sort of accusations of racism against their own family is they're trying to ground that
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.680]   privilege in victim status and and this is the thing that I think is really important is that
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.840]   the thing about privilege is privilege is a social concept it's got nothing to do with with success
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.420]   which is either earned or unearned and so the way that people get uh to maintain their privilege is
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.820]   is they again they ground it in some sort of victimization um it creates these very perverse
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:48.700]   incentives my reaction to the Meghan Markle uh Prince Harry interview was the following I had a
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:56.620]   lot of um sympathy uh for um what she was saying um but on the other side
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.340]   I also thought you must have known what you were getting into on the way in
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:06.580]   and there was it was be and now and look I'll say this as a Canadian and a Sri Lankan so the
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.200]   queen and the monarchy is an increa like I can't describe to you guys because you're not
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:20.440]   part of the Commonwealth but it is just a definitional part of who we are as we grow up and
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   I don't know what the equivalent American construct is I guess there isn't one really um and so you
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:26.560]   know the monarchy is a part of who we are as we grow up and I don't know what the equivalent American construct is I guess there isn't one really um and so you know the
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:34.180]   monarchy is an incredibly important thing but we all know that it's this kind of like anachronistic
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:39.520]   thing that just kind of I don't look for us it's not like I mean like if you said to
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.320]   me despite all my and raging against the machine and society and blah blah blah and stature and
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.520]   whatever if if I could be invited to meet the queen I would be there in eight nanoseconds
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.600]   okay I think the equivalent is the presidency we we actually feel that way about the presidency
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:59.020]   like going to visit the president is a big deal the presidency is not an endowed kind of circumstance
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.340]   there's something about there's something about the queen my point is though we all know a that
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.900]   it's important it's a great symbol of of the Commonwealth I'm very proud of all of that but
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:13.540]   we also know it's anachronistic and it doesn't make much sense and so what what do you uh what
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:18.340]   do you think you were marrying into and I think you know my perspective was I felt bad for her
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.580]   I can't believe you know it got to the place where like people wouldn't get
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:27.640]   help for her when she was sick and you know and then they were questioning Harry's or the the kids
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:36.040]   uh Archie's uh skin color I mean this is insanity like these people are stuck in the 1800s but then
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.880]   you realize they are actually stuck in the 1800s because they're not allowed to have a normal life
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.560]   they're not allowed to actually interact so you know are they at fault or they or is the system
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:50.200]   that creates these sort of like voyeuristic you know exotic animals in a zoo that we call the king
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.280]   the queen these princes
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.440]   is the system at fault I don't know I I was kind of like 50 50 on the interview but my perspective
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:02.200]   was the monarchy is in a really tough spot over the next 30 or 40 years because again so now let
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.220]   me tell you where my belief is I'm kind of a little bummed by the whole thing the monarchy
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.980]   doesn't mean what it what it what it used to be for me David what's what was more enthralling to
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:19.540]   you this week Tucker versus Taylor or the queen versus Oprah and Prince Henry I didn't I didn't
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:25.480]   spend I didn't spend a tremendous amount of time on either one I mean look I if I were if I were
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.340]   Harry I would probably do the same thing which is to basically leave look the first thing I did my
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:36.580]   career was Lee was quit the the firm right I you know who wants to work for a firm um you know it's
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:42.040]   very tracked um so I don't blame him leaving going to California you know that's what we that's what
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.960]   we all did right I mean he was being that's a very that's a very entrepreneurial American thing to do
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.220]   what what I what I had a problem with was the way that they're attacking their own family because
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.740]   they're being paid seven million dollars to do this interview no no no hold on they were not
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.000]   there was the first question Oprah asked and they were very clear they were not getting paid now they
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.740]   did sign a hundred million who made the seven million though no Oprah did Harpo did oh well
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:11.560]   she's a genius yeah she's a genius no no let's just be clean again Oprah Oprah is our queen
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:21.040]   it's even worse it's even worse if they did the interview for free and didn't even get a piece of
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.440]   the back end so all they did was attack and besmirch their family uh for for none of that
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.420]   and look I I I guess my my point is so so why would they do it if it's not even about the
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:36.100]   money I mean it's about this idea of defining their privilege grounding it in victim status
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:41.260]   and I think there's something very fake and phony about that and I think that's why people had this
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.120]   uh reaction to it where frankly they were I I don't think they're on the side of the royal
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:52.180]   family because it's it is outdated but I think the there was a lot of skepticism towards what
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:58.180]   Harry had a little bit of a problem with the like live from our 15 million dollar Montecito mansion
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:04.840]   no Jason I mean it was that was not for that house that was a friend they have a 15 million
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.680]   dollar house I know but they also have a 15 million dollar house next to Oprah well it's
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.200]   actually for that they put five million down they
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.160]   know it's public they put five million down and they took out a mortgage it's uh someone listed
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.140]   this whole thing no it's an honest question does the do the taxpayers of the UK fund the Princess
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.160]   that's the whole point they went and did a deal with Netflix and they start and Spotify and now
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.420]   they have a salary and they're making money like everybody else so I mean I'm not I'm not I don't
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.420]   have an issue with any of that no I don't have an issue with that I thought the taxpayers were
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:37.900]   funded the lifestyle they do fund the lifestyle of the other princes right sure yeah so I mean
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.020]   that's the thing can we talk about something important yeah
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:49.420]   okay so a people nft sold for 69 million dollars I mean this week this one is crazy all the dumbest
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:56.260]   happened this week Taylor Loren to this weekend dumb slaughtered on well yeah dumb so I miss I
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.480]   miss Tucker versus Taylor but actually the the real uh the person who took on Taylor that did
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.280]   a brilliant job was Glenn Greenwald I don't know I don't know if you guys read his post but that was
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.100]   brutal brilliant Savage brilliant and basically what he said is that look you've got a lot of people
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   who are going to be like you know what I'm not going to be able to get a job in the future
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.880]   you're going to be able to get a job in the future you're going to be able to get a job in the future
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.120]   you're going to be able to get a job in the future you're going to be able to get a job in the future
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.940]   is that look you've got these class of reporters out there who their job is to go out and they're
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:21.340]   like little Hall monitors you know trying to bust people for whatever they might say in a clubhouse
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.960]   room not just public figures but private people too they're in the business of destroying lives
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.640]   and reputations you know that that's basically their business model but then the second anyone
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.680]   has any criticism for them they claim it's harassment which is just absolute nonsense
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.060]   and they want to be funny they want to be immune from criticism the only person that was inoculated
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:40.060]   in the first place is the only person that was inoculated in the first place is the only person
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:40.060]   that was inoculated in the first place is the only person that was inoculated in the first place is
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:40.060]   the only person that was inoculated in the first place is the only person that was inoculated in the first place is
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:40.600]   the only person that was inoculated in the first place is the only person that was inoculated against
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.680]   against social justice wokeness to write that article is Glenn Greenwald because he is you
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:50.380]   know he's gay he's got brown kids he lives in Brazil you know with uh I mean it's it's fat it's
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:56.380]   like you can't irresistible force moving the immovable meeting the immovable object he he's
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.400]   not completely immune because he was he was attacked you know and and people said pretty
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.660]   nasty things about him but yeah he definitely has some I think Greenwald is an unbelievable
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:10.000]   writer who calls it like he sees it um I don't agree with everything he says all the time um
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.020]   but you know he's right to call this stuff out there was another bunch of social justice nonsense
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:19.240]   this week as well this this poor guy had to like give out this crazy apology tweet because he said
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.500]   he liked to exercise what happened wait what is that story okay this is the greatest okay there's
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.700]   a kid I've been telling you Jason I want you to exercise because I love you 20 pounds look at me
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.380]   I'm looking for sex boo I wanted yeah I want both of you guys to exercise tell me about it oh by the
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:38.860]   way public service announcement covid vaccine CA is the bot so at covid vaccine it just tweets every
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.940]   five minutes a hundred
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.960]   different places you can go pretend to be a door dash driver and get a shot sorry I mean
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:51.520]   if you were vaccinated check a box check the box let's go let's roll people don't let Newsome take
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:57.880]   away your health yeah don't let Newsome put don't focus on equity yeah I mean while he's at like uh
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.760]   Jason tell us about this uh okay tell us about this tweet thing what happened there's a kid
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.380]   named Dom he's an entrepreneur he's building a company it's a good company it's funded by Stripe
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.280]   you know it's raised hundreds of millions of dollars like good for this guy yeah but he likes
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.640]   you know he's kind of like trying to engage on Twitter and he basically said I feel so much
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.740]   better and I'm performing at such a higher level since I got my diet and my exercise right I mean
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:26.020]   people who are not getting their physical right are really underperforming at work it's such an
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:32.620]   opportunity or whatever and then you know the the large and in charge you know fat is beautiful you
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:38.860]   know contingent basically tried to cancel him sorry but did he say that you have to be skinny no he
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:44.200]   said you will perform if you're fat you're underperforming basically he didn't use the
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.580]   word fat but he said if you're not in shape you're underperforming at work which I said is there
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:53.020]   science behind this and yeah sure people showed me a hundred studies that show if you lose weight
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.520]   you have better concentration and focus I mean it's pretty obvious but he did the cardinal uh
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.920]   sin as uh here I'll read you the tweet an important lesson I learned well into my career if you are not
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:08.800]   physically fit and healthy then you are underperforming at work pretty basic probably not very controversial but
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:16.660]   he did what David Sachs always advises uh and the the the advice he gave to Trump which is never
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:23.860]   apologize um and he apologized Dom apologized and took the tweet down which then the mob really went
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:30.160]   after him and he said I screwed up and I'm extremely sorry I have recently spent a lot
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.800]   of energy focused on my fitness eating and sleep in my enthusiasm for my new fitness regime I posted
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.740]   a tweet that was meant to celebrate my new healthy lifestyle but the thing is I'm not going to be able to do that
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:47.380]   but that's not how it came across and I see now how I don't understand with all the problems that we
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:54.460]   have that need fixing I mean this is what people were focused on this but no but here's the kicker
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:59.680]   of the apology this is something I really need to improve on and I will well no I'm not making
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:05.560]   fun of him I just think it's sad what the hell is going on I mean don't apologize if you believe
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.680]   being healthier is you know good
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:14.320]   then you should say it and you know let the chips roll with it people can debate it but I mean can't
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.180]   we have a debate about that because this is in the middle of a covid crisis when the top two vectors
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:25.600]   are age and obesity period if you're fat you die from covid that's that's how it works and you got
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:33.340]   both those problems you're old and fat you guys didn't say stupid all right I'm doing good today
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:38.020]   all right today in uh all in nonsense apparently
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:44.800]   there's so much money in the system that an nft just sold for 69 million dollars after we talked
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.340]   about the previous one billy bought for six million dollars I don't know that he bought
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.720]   it for six million dollars but somebody bought one last week nfts seem like a real thing it's
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.840]   reasonable to trade stuff but 69 million dollars I think it's incredible I mean like like the the
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.640]   I saw the breakdown of like the number of bitters here let me actually just get this uh data up
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.960]   because I think you guys will find it really incredible my thesis on this or my theory rather
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.560]   is um
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:15.520]   um that there are a bunch of people who have stakes in these crypto assets and then they all
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:22.780]   premeditate decide to buy up these nfts to get the market started and then once it started like
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:28.420]   Jason that's honestly art right you know you know this but I've been buying art for a decade plus
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:34.000]   and this is exactly how it works in the art market you know we go in there certain people will go and
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.500]   buy and then what the gallerist says is oh did you know that chamath just bought this piece or such a
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.400]   person bought this other piece and then all of a sudden the price spins up and then they feed into
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.960]   it I mean this is where you know an enormous amount of money has been made by gallerists
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:52.060]   over the last 20 or 30 years now it just happens in a different medium so the the bidding breakdown
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:58.360]   by the way of this nft is incredible 33 active bitters 91 of the bitters were new to Christie's
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:06.520]   55 came from the Americas 27 of bitters were from Europe and 18 were in Asia the age breakdown is
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:15.280]   the most interesting six percent were gen Z so 97 to 2012. 58 of bitters were Millennials 94 and
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:21.100]   between 81 and 96 wow 33 Gen Xers and three percent baby boomers so this is really like
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:26.560]   a transitional change in you know basically deciding what's valuable and I don't think
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.160]   this I don't think this was any different than you know when you had this transition from you
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.660]   know sort of impressionist in the art world like if you moved from the body of work where you know
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.460]   these impressionist paintings were just going for
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.200]   um high tens low hundreds of millions of dollars and I think it peaked around Van Gogh
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.600]   um and then you know basically it went from there off of a cliff where you can basically
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.680]   give away impressionist paintings uh and everything went to contemporary and you know
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   sort of like this post-modern stuff and that was a decisional change by boomers what is what
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:05.080]   does giveaway mean to you Chamath hey you know tens of millions yeah exactly so okay
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:11.800]   so I think on the nft stuff and and people he's people as the artist there's two things going on
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.680]   right so one is on a technology level nfts non-fungible tokens there they are it's a
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:23.200]   legitimate technology for creating provenance on a blockchain you know if a piece of art
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.940]   um basically gets put on a blockchain you have perfect provenance but that doesn't mean that
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:33.700]   all nfts are valuable in fact most of them won't be it's just a technology then you have the other
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:39.040]   thing that's happening is on an art level what these sort of um these sort of prestige galleries
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:44.260]   and so on they're saying that people is now a major artist and there's and the reason someone
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.720]   becomes a major artist is because they usher in like an or become representative of some new wave
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.520]   of art like Chamatha saying you've got impressionism you've got modernism I mean the reason why Jackson
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:01.960]   Pollock sells for whatever 100 million dollars no no 300 to 600 okay it's because he represents an
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.640]   important wave in art
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:08.680]   and some of those waves fizzle out and they turn into Ponzi schemes and some of them become real and
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.660]   people are speculating that this digital art will be a major wave and they're saying that people is
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:18.520]   the most important artist and they're kind of betting on that now do I think it's gonna last
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:23.920]   um I don't know I mean hard to say you said that no you said the key thing though the key feature
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.660]   of nfts which I think is amazing is that you can actually have ownership and provenance written
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:34.000]   into a blockchain now you take that abstraction you can apply to all kinds of surface areas and
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.340]   it makes a ton of sense any kind of other asset would make sense if you own a car if you own
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:45.760]   clothes if you own watches if you own wine um what happens if you own a house now all of a sudden if
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.260]   you can prove ownership over this stuff not only can you trade it but you can also borrow against
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:56.320]   it and I think that that is a really interesting idea where once you financialize all of these
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.180]   physical assets that we own you do a little bit of a trade-off between the two and you can actually
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:05.080]   you do eliminate an enormous amount of inequality in the system because you can actually get real
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.100]   transparent pricing like now could you yeah block blockchains blockchains are a ledger right they're
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:15.880]   a perfect Ledger system and so like everything every type of possession that relies on title
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:21.820]   should eventually be blockchained so art art's a good example you know I um helped found a company
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:27.700]   back in 2017 called Harbor which was a blockchaining uh real estate and and I'm getting
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:38.380]   a uh acquired so now acquired or acquired no it got acquired we're gonna make money we're gonna
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:43.420]   make money as an LP I just wanted a clarification yeah no we're we're not gonna make like SPAC type
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.340]   money but we'll make a little bit of money on that deal so so don't worry um but but yeah look
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:53.020]   I think I I think we're in the early early stages of this type of technology you're gonna see
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.220]   eventually blockchaining of every of every type of asset where title is important David I think that
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:02.380]   this is such an amazing idea because like if you think of all of the opaque lending markets where
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:07.960]   people can't get access to reasonable cost of capital and they own assets you know you end up
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.520]   in these crazy worlds where like if you look at the the housing crisis uh or the great financial
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.900]   crisis you know there was like so much crazy lending but behind that lending was like double
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.880]   triple mortgages it's happening right now in the car market all of that stuff doesn't necessarily
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.740]   need to exist because if you have clear provenance and the ability to price risk you just get you know
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.960]   people can borrow a reasonable amount of money at a reasonable rate and pay it back and you know you
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.940]   can trade assets you could sell assets it's a really big deal I think I think um if you take
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:43.240]   a zoom out on the uh you know the notion of what an nft represents it's it doesn't feel too
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:48.580]   dissimilar from other um what I would argue is like non-productive assets like if you think about
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:56.020]   where one's capital goes where an individual puts their capital the first thing is kind of essentials
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:01.300]   right things you need like food and medicine and housing and clothing and whatnot and then you kind
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:06.160]   of enter into these kind of you know non-extend you know kind of discretionary spending for a
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.000]   consumer you know nice stuff nice clothes luxury goods things that are basically going to diminish
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.560]   then as you think about allocating the leftover capital you're either going to allocate your
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.240]   leftover capital into investable assets that are either productive or non-productive a productive
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:25.060]   asset is something you buy that you expect to return it produces some value for you as you own
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.980]   it such as owning a home where you get the value of living in it or owning a car where you get the
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:35.920]   utility of driving around in it or owning a bond which issues a you know a you know a coupon or a
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.760]   stock that's gonna you know generate cash flows at some point in the future theoretically
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:45.280]   um the non-productive assets are these assets that are just not designed to do that but they're a
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.980]   store of value that you expect at some point to realize some return
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:54.340]   um you know because someone else will pay a higher price to you for that non-productive asset this is
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:59.440]   like a piece of art or you know some piece of gold or something you know something that you kind of
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.200]   hold or you know more increasingly you know digital assets and it seems like the explosion
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.580]   in digital assets is you know as Jason pointed out at the beginning like as we've kind of moved
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:14.620]   to a highly kind of overvalued segment of productive assets as things that market is
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.160]   very frothy it's very difficult to kind of find productive assets that are worth putting capital
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.560]   into there's continually more interest in non-productive assets across the board because
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.180]   there's excess capital in the system and uh it turns out that when that happens there's enough
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.260]   of a market dynamic that emerges in non-productive assets that gives people a reason to put their
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.580]   capital in and expect to have a return on them in the future as soon as the market starts shrinking
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:41.080]   as soon as um you know you start having effects that are deflationary you know money will pour
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.620]   out of that market in general that's always what happens with the art market and has for hundreds
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:50.020]   of years um and it's a it's a it's the digital means of kind of realizing that same market
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:57.100]   transition that my my question is do you get the rights I guess this is a dependent on the terms
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:01.720]   that are set in the smart contract but in the case of the people if I were to buy it for 69 million
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:07.780]   do I have the rights to it so that I can print t-shirts and sell hundred dollar t-shirts or can
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:13.480]   I create 10 000 more of these can I monetize it is what I'm asking that's a great great great
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.320]   question I I don't know but that's a fabulous question by the way because the alternative like
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:23.680]   as you pointed out the artist and and other folks have rights to art um even though the original
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:31.120]   painting is what's sold you know the original um master of a Bruce Springsteen song could be sold
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.280]   to a collector but the rights the rights on that track for reproducing it making money off it or
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.380]   owned by a publishing house so you can own the physical magnetic tape but not own the rights to
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.520]   exploit and over time those rights fall away so if you think about what that nft represents it
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.300]   represents that particular chain of
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:52.280]   electrons and you know this is this is these bite these bits that represent this image
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:57.560]   um and it's not necessarily make a hundred more and then he could change he could change one pixel
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.420]   theoretically or two pixels and he could go print a bunch of stuff and go not right not really because
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.560]   those images were ones that he had he had this rhythm of creating like one a day I think for
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.600]   a very long period of time all into this master right exactly so there's a this is a it's a one
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:17.280]   of one another interesting uh one of one that just happened was these uh performance
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:24.060]   artists or I guess like underground digital artists uh bought a Banksy for 125 or 125 000
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:31.500]   dollars I get thousands and millions confused uh just that's a joke everybody well that's a that's
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:36.360]   a huge joke you want to use for this episode is hashtag cancel Chamath go ahead uh yeah good luck
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:47.260]   anyways these four guys bought bought this Banksy um for 125 000 they brought it to a warehouse in
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:55.660]   Brooklyn they took a high-res image of it okay so they took a picture of it and they created a one
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:04.480]   of one nft right okay then they created a YouTube video of them burning the original Banksy oh so now
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   all you had was the digital manifestation of this physical thing wait for it and then they sold it
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.240]   for three hundred and like fifty thousand dollars so they 3x their money
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:23.060]   it's the most incredible story um I I can find the link and I'll put it in the show notes as well
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.620]   but it just shows you what's happening and then I also think last thing on nfts I saw that I think
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:32.540]   it was like Kings of Leon just put out an album and it was like it's like 50 bucks for a song or
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.380]   something like that and it comes with like a bunch of uh interesting content so it's the
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:42.800]   beginning of something guys I just think that you need sort of like popular content to get
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.220]   this movement going but it seems to me like this is what people want to do they want to own digital
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:52.020]   assets they want to have provenance they want to have custodial relationships with it they want to
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:56.820]   basically but it's just like it's like art and posters right anyone can put the poster up in
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.440]   their room anyone can buy a copy for five bucks but who owns the original and owning the original
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.920]   may be visually identical maybe graphically identical but uh it is truly about that notion
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:13.800]   of that that theoretical human mind construct of ownership um that that creates that distinction
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.200]   and you just effectively have to count on other human minds believing the same
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.940]   thing in the future for you to be able to reclaim that value that that monetary value
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:26.260]   um or you're going to take a loss on it I mean Chamath have you ever sold art that you bought
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:33.460]   you know I've uh I've sold very little um I tend to buy and accumulate with this idea of
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.180]   eventually endowing something with just because it's like you know I think there are two ways
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.540]   to buy art one is speculatively and the other one is to tell a story
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:47.180]   um I took the second path um and so you know it's stuff that means a lot to me so it's hard for me to
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:51.860]   start with it even though it sits in a free port in Delaware so it's not exactly you know out and
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.080]   about um with this idea that at some points people will get to really enjoy it once by the way I mean
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.320]   one of the things that happens in the art world and correct me if I'm wrong on this but you buy
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:05.300]   this art and you don't ever a lot of art doesn't get resold so everyone kind of buys it under the
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.960]   notion that it's going to be worth more in the future and they can sell it for more but very few
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.660]   people actually do end up selling it no no that's it so here's in the trading market right but like
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:20.960]   I mean generally like a lot of collectors end up endowing art or or gifting it and when you gift it
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:25.940]   you get an appraisal done and you get a deduction on the appraised value right and so you can
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:30.920]   definitely do it that way so uh one one interesting story is that um one of the large auction houses
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:36.620]   has a financial arm and uh the most incredible thing is like over like the last 50 years
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:44.540]   um their cumulative default rate was 30 basis points on their book like cumulative
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:52.220]   not like a year or a month but ever nobody defaults well because they borrow money for
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:57.320]   the purposes of maybe buying other things or whatever and then they will very you know trade
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:02.480]   out of things and trade up to things and trade across things but it's a very vibrant market
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:09.500]   of buying and selling it just happens to be very informal and a little bit closed and very much
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:14.420]   for insiders and you know another reason that I think that nfts will will change because
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:19.820]   it'll will change this is that it just makes it available to everybody because you put all art on
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:24.380]   a very level playing field and really at the end of the day what is art it's a commentary on society
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:28.400]   and I think that having that level of transparency on that kind of stuff is I think is going to be
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:33.260]   really valuable because you don't want one or two people who you fundamentally disagree with as being
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.240]   a tastemaker for a kind of art that you think is fundamentally flawed right you'd rather it's just
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.740]   it's no different than being able to go to 95 different media sites to read the content you want
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.300]   or you know being able to listen to a thousand people and you know you're going to be able to
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:49.100]   listen to a thousand different kinds of music all of it in its totality is a commentary on society
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:54.020]   and I think what society says is we want transparency and we want choice and this is where
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:48:00.440]   I think like that's why I think so I think this is a good a good dovetail into what's happening with
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:06.380]   the stimulus bill and where we started which was is this even necessary um we have uh stimulus
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:12.800]   checks going out in the amount of 2 000 per individual in households with under 150k I believe
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:21.920]   at the income level which means people who were not impacted by financially in any way by what's
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.900]   happened under covid are going to get in a family of five ten thousand dollar checks uh even if
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:32.060]   nobody was laid off or that's only that's only like nine percent of the bill Jason yeah I mean
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:38.960]   so it's it was 450 million out of 1.9 trillion so what do we think the impact we sort of have I have
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:43.460]   a working Theory oh sorry go ahead what are your general thoughts on this is it necessary and then
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:49.640]   what's the what are the second order effects that we each predict will happen over the next 18 months
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.260]   when all of this capital gets injected so the the latter is what I've been focused on trying
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:59.300]   to figure out and I saw some really interesting data which basically I'll ask you guys a question
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:05.420]   because maybe you guys know the answer but if you measure wealth inequality when do you guys
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:13.340]   think was the most recent period where there was the least wealth inequality the least well sorry
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:18.680]   how do you define that uh you can measure it like the Ginny index or you can measure it as like you
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:24.860]   know the gap between the top decile and the bottom decile in terms of uh wealth and accumulated assets
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:31.160]   well would it be before the robber Barons no it was the between the robber Barons and now the period
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:36.320]   of the least inequality in recent history was in the late 70s which is an incredible stat to say
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:42.200]   where the gap between the top decile and the bottom decile was like you know kind of like on an index
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.220]   like 60.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:50.900]   65 whereas today it's sort of like at 100. um now what happened then and it's this is really
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:56.600]   interesting wasn't that an inflationary period there you go so what happened and as it turns out
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:03.080]   inflation is a phenomenal way to decrease level of the playing field absolutely it decreases
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:09.020]   people's richness so it makes rich people poorer that's really the most effective tool that you
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:13.100]   have to recalibrate it's very very hard to redistribute money
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:18.500]   and I think every attempt at doing that has largely failed but the one consistent way and
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:23.600]   if you go back periods before that you know into the beginning of the but in an inflationary
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.240]   environment borrowing costs go up so you know businesses and people that rely on borrowing to
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:32.960]   grow their net worth or investing assets to grow their net worth kind of suffer more than people
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:38.120]   that what have a home have a you know wages go up in an inflationary environment right wages go up
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.980]   which which actually if you think about like what you said before like you know as people get wealthier
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.480]   they they move their money into you know essentially financial assets and away from sort
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:53.240]   of like working assets and when you know interest rates go up and the the risk-free rate goes up then
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.620]   the attractiveness of those assets go down yeah and so what happens is shares and technology
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:03.140]   companies go down but what what actually also happens is that your cost of capital
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:07.880]   for a traditional business because it's higher they have to then charge more which means that
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.860]   they're paying their employees more and those folks um on a marginal basis tend
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:18.680]   to then you know take those dollars and spend those dollars so inflation is this very productive
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:24.200]   mechanism of actually redistributing wealth and actually homeowners benefit homeowners benefit as
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:31.940]   well but like you know it shrinks it shrinks the the wealth you know mild inflation mild inflation
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:40.280]   is probably good it's better than probably deflation but if it tips over into hyperinflation
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.740]   then it destroys everyone's savings
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:47.060]   right and rich people have the ability to protect their assets against inflation a lot better than
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:53.720]   middle class people do so you know you look at like Venezuela we are Germany hyperinflation yeah
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:59.360]   people just hyperinflation destroyed the value of of of uh where are we seeing inflation where
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:04.340]   do we anticipate we'll see inflation I saw today Tesla's Tesla raised the price on all their cars
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:08.420]   except for two well they have to because the inputs of you know if you think about like if
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.380]   you break down a Tesla and you look at where the money goes the money really is in the batteries and
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.460]   you break down the batteries it goes into three critical inputs lithium nickel and cobalt and the
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:23.540]   prices are highly suspect and um they're they're very poorly predicted and so the cost of tests
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:28.760]   are going to go up by 20 or 30 percent and there's nothing that there's nothing that Tesla could do
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.160]   and by the way you'll see this across all commodity products if inflation takes hold in a in a
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:41.540]   meaningful way um including uh you know food products Ag products you know um all commodities
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.500]   you know metals
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:47.420]   um but um the businesses that will benefit the most and this is really interesting from a
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:51.560]   technology perspective and I think it played in part my understanding is speaking to a number of
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:57.800]   PMs about this portfolio managers at funds um is that you know technology companies don't have a
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:03.320]   lot of hard assets um and so they have less kind of um you know value accretion and they don't
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.120]   play in a commodity supply chain so it's much more difficult for a technology company to say
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.380]   raise rates by thirty percent whereas a food company can raise rates by thirty percent one of
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.900]   the ways to look at this is to look at the um you know the book value or the capex you know property
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:22.820]   plant and equipment of a business and businesses that have a lot of pp e are generally going to do
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.500]   better in an inflationary environment they're going to have more throughput on that pp they're
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:32.420]   going to have higher dollars per unit of pp e and so you'll see you know this is why there was a
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:36.080]   shift of dollars into what are traditionally called kind of value stocks or you know kind of
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:41.240]   bigger industrial companies away from you know softer kind of tech companies which don't really
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:46.160]   really benefit from this inflationary trend um and so there's going to be you know some sort of play
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:52.160]   out in in those sorts of products probably more jcal than I think David do we see it in SAS because
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:58.760]   I've noticed that SAS prices are going up and that people are just keep adding to the price of these
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:04.220]   SAS products I was pricing out all the virtual conference you know stuff like hop in and all
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:09.740]   that airmeet and whatever and I was just shocked at how much they wanted to charge you know 15 50 100
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.120]   000 a year and I was like but
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:16.580]   can I use like zoom and this for that you know in a chat room slack room and are we going to see it
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.880]   happen in SAS where people are going to start raising the prices and just increase their profit
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:23.420]   margin because their employees are going to demand more money because they're part of this cycle
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:29.300]   I I think that's a function of pricing power going up for SAS companies as they become more
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:33.020]   established and entrenched those companies are very profitable I don't think they're
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:37.580]   experiencing wage pressure in any way I think they're just becoming more successful their
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.000]   pricing power is going up as they become not necessarily Monopolus
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.140]   but as they have more market share and they dominate their categories they can increase
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:50.600]   prices but I want to go back to this idea of the 1970s because I want to I want to challenge the
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:56.480]   idea that the U.S economy was doing well in the 1970s so Chamath mentioned the the Ginny index
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:03.560]   there was a different kind of metric called the misery index um that uh was was a much more
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:07.760]   popular index that was used around that time and the misery index um it was defined by a Brookings economist and it was a kind of a
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:13.700]   um it was defined by a Brookings economist and it was basically the sum of the unemployment rate and
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:21.680]   the inflation rate and in 1980 the misery index was 19.7 percent this is why Ronald Reagan got
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:28.340]   elected is because you had a CPI which the inflation rate of 12.5 percent and then you
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:37.640]   had unemployment of another 7.2 percent on top of that and you know the 1970s were uh especially the
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:43.700]   late 70s were an economic disaster for the country so maybe things were more nominally equal but
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:50.480]   everyone was equally more equally poor um and what you saw in the 1980s is that they got you
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:56.060]   know inflation under control uh Paul Volcker at the Fed broke inflation that lowered interest
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:02.660]   rates enormously that allowed people to buy homes um the stock market went up and um you know it
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:07.520]   was an economic boom so I don't know that this idea that we we want to introduce a lot of inflation
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:13.400]   into the system is a good idea like I said I think mild inflation of say two percent is better than
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:19.700]   two percent deflation the other way but uh but I I think we should be very careful here about um
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:23.180]   about uh inflation and making sure it doesn't get out of control
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:30.380]   and the other index to look at is the quality of life index which is typically you know health care
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:37.400]   um and then the property price to your income ratio commuting pollution uh safety
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:42.980]   and those kind of things and you know the United States is 15th on that list with obviously the
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:49.940]   Nordics and Australia uh Germany New Zealand just being at the top of those rankings in America we've
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:54.680]   never really thought about that right we don't really even discuss happiness you know and that
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.240]   and that quotient we don't index for that happiness and low stress I think we're talking
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.200]   a lot about quality of life in San Francisco now because that's a community that's very
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:07.280]   rich and yet it's a miserable city to live in because crime is out of control you know Jason
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:13.880]   you and I have been to focusing on this uh DA Chase a buden who's had an enormous impact on people's
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.160]   quality of life because he's simply not prosecuting uh theft in the city there's actually it was a
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:26.840]   crazy tweet where a city council member was inside City Hall calling for a hearing on the rampant rise
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.460]   and theft in the city and meanwhile his car was broken into right outside City Hall I mean you
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:36.020]   can't make this stuff up and then the other thing that came out were a whole series of statistics
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:44.000]   of scopes showing or sorry trials and convictions basically Chesa has not been uh has not been
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.160]   conducting any trials he hasn't been convicting anyone it turns out that the number of trials and
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:55.340]   convictions that he's gotten in the 14 months he's been DA is one-tenth of what Gascon got
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:01.640]   when he was DA and by the way Gascon's not the model DA or anything I mean Gascon is facing a
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:07.040]   recall in LA for dereliction of duty and he's still 10 times more productive than Chase a budin
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:15.200]   um just a quick update uh many of you uh when I mentioned the GoFundMe for uh to put a journalist
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:22.100]   on Chesa if you just type in GoFundMe Chesa c-h-e-s-a into the Google we added eight thousand
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.540]   dollars since last week so we have 58 000 that's going to a journalist and a data journalist to
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:30.500]   cover this exact issue so thanks to the folks who donated I'm not taking any money from it
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:36.920]   I'm donating obviously um other than a small other than a small finder's fee no zero dollars
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:43.040]   I'm donating to it I basically said I'll be one percent of it whatever the final number is I think
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.240]   the marina times has done a great job with this um yeah and there have been a couple other sources
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:51.860]   as well but but how dishonest was it I mean this has been a recurring theme on the pod so I just
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:56.000]   want to touch on it Chase has sent his little mouthpiece his little minion the high school
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.240]   friend to go out and challenge us writing that blog post saying that it was a lie that Chaser
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:06.800]   wasn't prosecuting anybody and lo and behold the numbers have come out he tried to claim that
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:13.160]   uh Chesa had the same rate of charging that goes Gascon did and that was true but the problem is
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:17.780]   he's been pleading down all these charges he's not taking anyone to trial he's not convicting anyone
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:24.020]   he's certainly not locking anybody up so I mean what what a lie that was well and criminals are
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:30.380]   just so savvy that they actually understand what the chances are of them actually getting convicted
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:36.680]   and they shape their grift and their crime to whatever the environment they're in is just like
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.940]   people who deal drugs just like people who take these hardcore fentanyl drugs they just pick the
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:45.620]   market where they're going to be most welcome so they're not going to do it down in Palo Alto or
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:51.320]   San Mateo or Mill Valley they're going to do it on Turk Street yeah so so I think that's how it starts
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:57.500]   but I gotta tell you you know I'm in LA right now and um there was a an episode like last week at
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:04.820]   um opus style but like oh yes and it's it's on Cannon Street and downtown Beverly Hills a lot of
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:12.080]   celebrities go it's a great Italian place there's a lot of outdoor seating there was basically a
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:16.340]   mugging of someone's just sitting at a table apparently they were wearing a really nice watch
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:22.220]   and some and and they were they were robbed at gunpoint in the middle you know the middle of
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.600]   the of the restaurant yeah lunchtime and then there was a struggle over the gun I don't know
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.100]   why the guy just didn't hand over the watch but anyway he struggled over the gun four shots went
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:36.440]   off one of them bounced off the concrete and hit a woman in the leg oh my God so this is like it's
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.920]   getting I mean it's getting out of hand sounds like San Paolo where they chop people's arms off
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:45.200]   for the watch I mean they literally will drive by apparently and just cut your arm off if they can't
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.860]   if you don't give them the watch well I just you know the criminals are starting to feel emboldened
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.180]   because Gascon and budine are not they're not having trials they're not prosecuting they're
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:57.980]   not locking people up and so they're graduating to more and more serious offenses I'm sure they
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.060]   probably didn't want to shoot anybody or maybe that wasn't their intention they just want to
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:06.320]   steal the watch but it resulted in a shooting just like the deaths of
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.480]   Hannah Abe and Elizabeth Platt when you had you know Troy McAllister you know hit them with the
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:17.720]   car so I mean the fact that we're not locking people up is resulting in in in people dying
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:23.120]   and a lot of risky very risky behavior all right as we wrap here a lot of spacks going out we
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.900]   obviously saw um another I guess Roblox was a direct listing um just curious only only
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:36.200]   underpriced by 50 percent it's the same same problem as the IPO just so so basically what
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:43.220]   you're saying is Bill Gurley's on his headset walking around El Camino Real no what I'm saying
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:50.180]   is what I'm saying is uh irrespective of what the the goals of the direct listing were the result is
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:55.640]   the same as a traditional IPA there you go um well can I give a shout out to a company that David
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:04.460]   Sachs um sure oh pipe yes which is an incredible company that basically like helps you capitalize
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.080]   your contracts with your customers
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.420]   and it's just it's just basically this incredible thing that I'm seeing and it's and there's a
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:16.640]   couple of others that do it as well um clear Bank is another one but you can fund your company
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.320]   non-dilutably and at some point I think we should actually talk about the state of the Union in
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.740]   Venture maybe we can do that in a couple of next episodes I have a lot of thoughts on where I think
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:30.140]   Venture Capital is going and when I see things like pipe I'm just like completely so happy
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:35.960]   because I just think it's uh it's it's it's going to change the the the way in which Venture Investing
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:40.700]   is done it's a it's a very brilliant idea you can go to pipe.com twist to get 12 months free
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:47.660]   um pipe.com is a two-sided Marketplace if you have reoccurring SAS revenue or any kind of
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:52.700]   reoccurring revenue somebody did it with the sub stack so I think pomp Liano the guy who
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:58.760]   pumps Bitcoin he has a newsletter that makes whatever quarter million dollars a year
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:05.840]   um he sold for 95 cents on the dollar his forward-looking subscriptions for the year and bought
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.660]   Bitcoin with it when it was at 35. so he's like doubling down but if you're a SAS company and we
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:16.520]   have many of them in our portfolios you could take all of your monthly contracts sell them on
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.440]   the Marketplace to somebody else not pipe pipe doesn't buy it it's some other financial person
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.400]   who says I'll give you 94 cents on the dollar give you 92 cents on the dollar give you 85 cents on
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.560]   the dollar and so if you were if you have a 10 million dollar book of business paying monthly
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.720]   you can get that 10 million now and deploy it but Jason I think more customers I think this
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.980]   is good this is a good maybe way to end but I think let's agree that the next pod let's talk
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:44.720]   let's start with the future of venture capital 100 I mean it's changing dramatically it's changing
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.740]   dramatically and I I think these non-dilutive ways of growing a company will completely impact
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:54.500]   pricing you know pre-money post money the amount of equity that employees can and should own in
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:00.380]   these businesses you know what is the value of Brands like you know it it like people will know
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:05.600]   who David Sachs is and who Harry Hurst is people that sincerely don't even care anymore like you
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.340]   know hey if I'm calling from Sequoia what does that mean anymore um they're gonna say who from
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:14.180]   Sequoia is called uh so these are all really interesting topics that I think we're talking
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.380]   about another path is just the public markets you know right I mean public markets are becoming the
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:23.240]   new late stage private market and it's really you know both the SPAC and early stage IPO and direct
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:29.600]   listing models are um are changing dramatically and it's um and there's more speculative risk
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.480]   seeking in the public markets in a way that I don't think we've ever seen um and it's uh it's creating
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.120]   an opportunity for companies that are still you know what in a traditional um kind of sense might
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.760]   be called you know early stage or still businesses with a lot of risk being able to go public and and
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.680]   you know kind of take their companies out and let the public markets wager on on how well they're
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.340]   going to execute and and how well they're going to be able to develop their product or their market
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.760]   and it's by the way it's something we've seen historically with biotech where there's kind
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:02.840]   of very binary kind of bets that happen and binary outcomes because the markets are known
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.360]   and you don't need to kind of productize or build a business around it but
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.140]   now we're actually taking both business risk market risk technology risk product risk
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:15.920]   um at all stages and I think you're going to see these um these scenarios where people will build
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.380]   public portfolios public uh public company portfolios that will perform a lot like venture
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:26.360]   portfolios right you'll have one or two businesses that'll have a 10 bagger and you know a chunk
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.500]   that'll go to zero and a chunk that'll have some modest return on them and it's going to be yeah
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.260]   it's going to be this tremendous learning experience because a lot of people will put
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:35.240]   all their money into one stock that they think is
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.860]   already been made it's already it's already done things it's Netflix it's Netflix it's you know
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:44.480]   their promise of the future is 100 certain and the reality is their promise of the future is
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.900]   five percent certain and so depending on the price you're entering and how many of these
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:52.280]   things you buy you could build a portfolio that could have a good return but it's um it's going
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.360]   to be a lot of speculative betting and a lot of losses and if you don't diversify you're going
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:00.200]   to lose a lot of money and you know so the question is also how does it evolve regulatory
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.980]   wise Chamath how are you communicating that to the market because you'll have some spacks that go out
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:10.880]   I would think Virgin Galactic is in that more like they're a deep tech researching phase and
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.220]   then you have other ones that are already you know churning the the ringing the register right
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:20.840]   so how do you communicate that to retail investors or the audience or that's up to them to do the
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.920]   research how do you think about that I mean there's as well as the bad inventory that's
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:33.020]   getting added no look yeah I do a tweet storm I do a one pager I have a multi-hour detailed investor
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:33.860]   presentation that's taped I have a multi-hour detailed investor presentation that's taped I have a multi-hour detailed investor presentation that's taped
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:43.360]   and then we have a typically a 100 to 300 page s4 so you can ingress into finding out the true story
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.360]   of a business at whatever point you want it really just does come down to doing your work I mean a lot
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.620]   of the folks on Twitter you know when you see the market straight down and they complain my reaction
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:57.740]   is stop crying and do your own work and there isn't there like we have complete transparency in
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:03.020]   this process so it is up to people to do their job and the thing that I think is happening right now
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:03.740]   is people think that they don't know what's going on and they're like well I don't know what's going on
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.680]   they don't have to do a job and that money is free and it's not it's hard to make it it's hard
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.300]   to make good investments it's hard to build a company everything is hard nothing is really
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:16.640]   easy because if it was easy everybody would be doing it all the time and so that's that's what
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:20.780]   I would love to leave people with I really got to go guys I love you guys let's but let's start with
