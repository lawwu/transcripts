[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.160]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.200]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200]   I'm your host.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.520]   On a recent podcast, I talked to you about how to maximize your height so that you have
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.000]   the best possibility of gaining all the benefits that come from being tall.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.320]   The specific connection to personal finance is that we have some academic estimates and
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.480]   scholarly discussions that estimate that for about every inch of height that you have over
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.880]   the normal person, you can increase your earning power by perhaps more than 2%.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.320]   The numbers vary a little bit, but 2% is a conservative estimate.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.600]   I've seen as high as 2.8%, so I just call it 2% to be safe.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.080]   Now, most of that discussion, though, is centered on men because the differences for income
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.920]   related to height are primarily or most marked with regard to men.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.040]   They're not so clear in the data with regard to women, and that would make sense to us,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   I think, generally.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.840]   It would make sense that men and women are treated differently, and there's a different
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   set of traits and characteristics that women are judged by versus the ones that men are
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.120]   judged by.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.120]   But just because I focused on that in that podcast episode doesn't mean that any of the
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.360]   advice that I gave was necessarily inapplicable to women.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.040]   After all, our daughters, especially during their puberty years and teenage years, our
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.280]   daughters need to have ample amounts of food.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.000]   Our daughters need to have ample amounts of sleep.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.800]   Our daughters need to have ample amounts of physical exercise.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.160]   But the question is, is there something that is different about trying to transmit these
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.280]   characteristics to men versus to women?
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.640]   And I think there obviously are.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.280]   After all, if I play fast and loose with the things that we don't have data for, for example,
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.440]   we understand that people who are good looking probably get kind of a beauty premium.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.920]   A man who's very handsome or a woman who's very beautiful has an easier time in some
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.360]   things in the world.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   Somebody who's in great shape.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.840]   We could go on and on with this logic forever.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.240]   But what I want to do in today's podcast is I want to share with you some information
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.000]   that I learned from a book called Girls on the Edge by Dr. Leonard Sachs, specifically
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.600]   about the things that we should be treating differently in the physical development of
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.720]   women and our daughters as compared to the physical development of men.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.640]   Because a lot of things related to the body, the development of the body, the development
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.120]   of athletic ability, a lot of our focus historically comes from men, from helping to develop young
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   men.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   And a lot of the things that we do to develop young men can be very damaging to women.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.960]   Now, this, the outline of what I'm going to share with you comes from chapter six of Girls
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.240]   on the Edge.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.360]   Chapter six is entitled Body.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.720]   And it's not the most important thing.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.920]   His first chapter was he talked about the sexual identity of girls.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.140]   Chapter two, he talked about social media.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.000]   Chapter three, dreams and obsessions.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.760]   Chapter four, environmental toxins.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.240]   Chapter five, mind.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.280]   This chapter, body.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.640]   And then the next chapter, spirit.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.400]   It's a good book that I recommend, and I've shared with you some resources from this book
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.600]   previously.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.840]   But specifically with regard to helping our daughters to develop their bodies, we need
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.920]   to understand that the way that we treat girls in their physical development needs to be
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.220]   different than the way that we treat boys.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.520]   That doesn't make it any less important.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.420]   We want our daughters to be strong and confident.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.400]   And a huge component of that personal strength and confidence comes from their physical development.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.600]   But we need to understand that it's a little bit different.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.360]   So I'm just going to jump into this.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.880]   Consider this to be a personal finance light episode.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.760]   If you're interested in these topics related to human development, you'll enjoy this episode.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.400]   If you're looking for nuts and bolts on personal finance, this isn't your cup of tea.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.320]   I will, one final note before I get into the text is simply that this chapter is, as is
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.640]   this entire book, heavily footnoted, I counted 76 footnotes for all the statements that Dr.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.760]   Sachs makes in this particular chapter.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.880]   I'm not going to try to cite everything because that's annoying.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.900]   But just know that if you're interested, check out this book, Girls on the Edge.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.600]   If you intended for a girl to suffer a major injury, you would take away all her other
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.680]   sports before puberty, make her play her one sport all year round, and then you would just
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.220]   wait.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.280]   Michael Sokolov.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.000]   Which is better, hopscotch or baseball?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.440]   Jump rope or soccer?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.880]   Better for whom?
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.840]   Better for what?
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.040]   Physical education for elementary school kids in North America usually includes instruction
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.600]   in baseball, learning how to swing a bat to hit the ball, run the bases, and so forth.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.380]   It's much less common for kids to receive formal instruction in hopscotch.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.720]   We encourage kids to play competitive soccer far more often than we encourage them to play
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   competitive jump rope.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   How come?
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.160]   8-year-old boys are, on average, better than girls at tasks that require targeting a moving
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.780]   object in space, which means boys are likely to have an edge in games that involve swinging
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.480]   a bat to hit a pitched ball or kicking a moving soccer ball into a goal.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.080]   8-year-old girls are, on average, better than boys at tasks that require balance, which
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.720]   means girls will have the edge in games such as hopscotch or jump rope.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.400]   Our physical education programs for children usually promote sports where boys have the
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.560]   advantage while de-emphasizing or ignoring sports where girls have the advantage.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.240]   When surveyed, girls typically think boys are better athletes than girls.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.480]   One reason may be that our physical education programs emphasize sports such as baseball,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.440]   football, and soccer in which boys enjoy advantages while devaluing or ignoring activities where
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.880]   girls enjoy the advantage, such as the balance beam, hopscotch, or jump rope.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.760]   Ignoring gender puts girls at a disadvantage.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.120]   In the gym, as in the classroom, we teach girls pretty much the same way we teach boys
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.880]   simply because there hasn't been much serious consideration that maybe what works best for
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.660]   boys might not always work best for girls.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.440]   I still encounter suspicion when I suggest that girls should be taught differently, either
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.600]   in the classroom or on the playing field.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.280]   Whenever I make such a suggestion, I often get the response, "Are you suggesting that
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.000]   girls can't do what the boys can do?"
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.200]   But ignoring differences between girls and boys doesn't provide a level playing field.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.840]   As we will see, it often puts girls at a disadvantage and at risk.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.000]   A second reason that so many girls believe that boys are better athletes is probably
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.960]   because the boys tell them so, beginning in elementary school.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.920]   Many boys boast about their athletic prowess.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.360]   As one team of investigators reported, girls are more realistic about their competencies
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.880]   while boys overestimate their physical competence, especially in the early years.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.160]   Most adult women, and many teenage girls, have figured out that boys often exaggerate
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.240]   their athletic skills, but most eight-year-old girls haven't yet discovered that boys are
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.280]   not trustworthy regarding their self-assessment of their own athletic ability.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.560]   Now, I'm going to make comments as I read this, and I think one of the reasons I want
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.060]   to share this information with you is that I believe it's our responsibility to cultivate
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:09.440]   environments in which boys can thrive and in which girls can thrive.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.480]   We can't, maybe it's out there, maybe I just haven't found the research yet.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.520]   We can't, so I'll make my statement, but I don't know of how we can estimate specifically
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:25.360]   the impact of personal self-confidence on income, on the amount of income that is earned.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.520]   If those studies have been done, I haven't stumbled into them yet, but I haven't gone
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.520]   looking.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.360]   There was a lot years ago in the self-esteem world and self-confidence and all of that.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:42.620]   My basic way of summarizing what I understand about that area of research is that self-confidence
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.040]   is real, self-esteem is real, but it has to be earned.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.520]   It has to be earned by genuine accomplishment.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.200]   Kind of fake confidence or just pretending that you have it is of only limited value.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.840]   It has to actually be earned.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.800]   So if we want our children and ourselves to succeed, we need to create environments in
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.000]   which we can genuinely succeed, and what's interesting is it doesn't have to be any one
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.080]   particular thing.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.200]   So what we need to do is we need to create environments in which our boys and our girls
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.560]   can work hard and develop skills that allow them to truly shine.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.880]   The problem is that in today's androgynous world where we're all bent and determined
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.760]   to never ever indicate that there may be any difference between boys and girls, because
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.280]   to indicate so would be a complete failure of all of our modern gender experiment, we
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.680]   wind up handicapping boys and girls.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.880]   And I've found that basically in every area this is difficult.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.600]   We'll talk more in this chapter about the value of boys-only education or boys-only
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.320]   classes and girls-only education, girls-only classes, and you'll see some of the research
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.880]   that we know on this.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.000]   But bring it up.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   We brought it up.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.440]   My wife has brought it up in kind of our homeschool co-op, which is a conservative homeschool
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.520]   co-op filled with Christians, it's a Christian homeschool co-op, and yet nobody is willing
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.040]   to even consider the idea that boys and girls learn differently.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.600]   Nobody is willing to even consider the fact that, hey, let's try out some things that
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.440]   are gender-divided because somehow that would be bad for the girls.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.280]   What's the point of physical education?
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.440]   Why bother?
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.560]   Is it about the joy of sports?
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.080]   But the sports that bring joy to a child may be different for girls compared with boys.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.200]   And the best way to engage girls in sport is often different from the best way to engage
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.840]   boys.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.000]   Men may be less likely to understand how to engage girls in sport than women are.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.520]   If that's true, it would be helpful to have women coaching girls.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.160]   But the majority of coaches for most team sports are men.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.480]   In fact, the proportion of coaches who are women has actually declined significantly
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.920]   over the years.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:53.080]   In 1972, 90% of coaches of women's teams at American colleges and universities were
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.080]   women.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.040]   In 2006, the proportion of women coaches among coaches of women's sports had dropped to
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   42%.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   The latest survey shows that proportion to have dropped further, slightly, to 41%.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.960]   So, we went from 90% to 41 or 42%, cutting more than half.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.480]   We have more girls and young women playing sports today, but proportionately fewer women
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.000]   coaching them.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.240]   That's true at every level, from beginner leagues for seven-year-olds right up through
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   college.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.960]   As Michael Sokolov writes in his book about girls in sport, "The unspoken feeling in
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.120]   many settings is that men know sports.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   They've been at it longer.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.120]   So, if you want your daughter's travel team to succeed and the girls to get scholarships,
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.700]   you'd better have a male coach."
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.760]   Among parents who have kids playing competitive sports, more than 27% of fathers coach their
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.620]   child's sport team.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.760]   Less than 4% of the mothers are coaches.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:54.760]   That imbalance leads to a third reason why so many girls assume that sports are, fundamentally,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.160]   male territory.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160]   The experts, the coaches, are overwhelmingly male.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.360]   The fact that so many girls think that males are better at sports may also explain why
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.280]   most girls attach more weight to their father's opinion about their own athletic ability than
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.600]   they do to their mother's opinion.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   Gym teachers matter.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   Coaches matter.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.200]   The style of the coach or the P.E. teacher may have a big influence on how your daughter
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.600]   views sports and her own ability to play.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.440]   Some coaches have a relentless focus on playing to win.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.440]   That's not helpful for most kids, both girls and boys, but it's particularly harmful for
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.120]   many girls.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.400]   The research consistently shows that girls are more likely to be engaged in sports when
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   coaches focus on helping kids master skills, praising good performance, and offering encouragement
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.000]   and supportive criticism when girls make mistakes.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.200]   Coaches or gym teachers who make fun of the klutzy kids or coaches who ignore kids who
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.400]   aren't athletically talented will not make good coaches for most girls.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.560]   We also know that coaches who play favorites can turn girls off a sport very quickly.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.880]   If girls believe that the coach has favorites, then the unfavored girls may quit.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:12.360]   Girls should be active and as athletic as they can be, within healthy limits.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.520]   We discuss some of the limits in Warning Science in Chapter 3.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.400]   As a parent, you can help your daughter choose the sports and physical activities she most
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.320]   enjoys, and where she can fulfill her athletic potential with the greatest benefits and lowest
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.840]   risks.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.780]   All sports carry some degree of risk, of course.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.200]   You must understand the risks and balance them against the benefit.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.480]   In helping your daughter choose a sport, the first question you need to answer is this,
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.080]   which are the most dangerous sports?
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.640]   I think you're going to enjoy this section, it's pretty astonishing.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.800]   Ashley Marie Burns was just a few weeks away from starting 9th grade.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.600]   She was one of 12 incoming freshman girls chosen for the cheerleading team at Medford
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.800]   High School in Massachusetts.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.780]   She and three other girls were rehearsing a stunt called an arabesque double down.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.800]   The three other girls were to throw Ashley in the air and then catch her.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.920]   Ashley had previously executed the stunt without a problem.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.280]   Indeed, she was renowned as one of the best flyers on the squad.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.960]   At 4.51 p.m., the girls tried the stunt.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.540]   Ashley came down wrong, landing in the other girls' arms with her chest down instead
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.100]   of on her back.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.460]   She didn't appear to be injured, nothing was broken or dislocated, but she complained
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.400]   of feeling short of breath.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.560]   The coach told her to stretch her hands over her head and then send her to the bathroom
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.420]   to splash cold water on her face.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.520]   Ashley still didn't feel right, but nobody called 911 until she passed out half an hour
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.960]   later.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.240]   She never regained consciousness.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:15:12.400]   She was pronounced dead at the hospital at 6 o'clock p.m.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.200]   An autopsy revealed that she had lacerated her spleen when she fell.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.920]   She died of massive internal bleeding.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:27.400]   Unfortunately, Ashley's story is not unique, nor was her injury an incredibly rare accident.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:33.800]   Girls' cheerleading is by some measures the most dangerous sport kids do today.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.480]   More dangerous even than football or ice hockey if the measure of danger is the number of
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.440]   serious injuries per thousand athletes.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.600]   The National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research (NCCSI) publishes an annual
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:53.080]   report chronicling deaths and serious injuries sustained by high school and college athletes.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:16:00.220]   Over 25 years, the NCCSI documented a total of 156 serious injuries or deaths among high
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.800]   school girls and college women.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.880]   Of those, 97 occurred in cheerleading.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.640]   That's more than in all other girls' sports combined.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:17.040]   Dr. Robert Cantu, a professor of neurosurgery at Boston University School of Medicine and
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.680]   a co-author of the NCCSI report says, "What's staggering, really, is that the single most
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:28.000]   dangerous activity in sports in schools is to be a flyer in cheerleading," he says.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.920]   The chance for catastrophic injury is exponentially higher than for any other sports activity.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.600]   Cheerleading epitomizes some of the worst aspects of sports for girls.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.520]   To begin with, there is a major emphasis on how you look.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.320]   If you are playing volleyball, the coach isn't going to care (and shouldn't care) whether
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.480]   your socks match or whether your gym shorts have a smudge of dirt on them.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.520]   But in cheerleading and related sports like drill team and dance team, you not only have
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.080]   to execute the stunt, you also have to look pretty and smile while you do it.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.720]   In most jurisdictions, cheerleading is organized as an "activity" rather than a bona fide
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   sport.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.840]   That means that the safety requirements for the cheerleading squad are no different from
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.960]   the requirements for the chess team or the debate team.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.920]   The chess team isn't required to have a certified athletic trainer in attendance.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.440]   Neither are the cheerleaders.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.280]   The coach of the debate team isn't required to be certified in injury assessment.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.280]   Neither is the coach of the cheer squad.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.400]   Ashley's life might have been saved if the adults in attendance had understood the risks
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.240]   of splenic injury after a fall and had called 911 immediately rather than waiting until
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.640]   Ashley lost consciousness.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.960]   Cheerleading has changed dramatically over the past four decades.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.760]   Thirty years ago, cheerleaders were usually girls who jumped up and down on the sidelines
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.320]   leading cheers.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.800]   Nowadays, the emphasis, beginning around age 10, is on high-flying stunts.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.640]   Today, cheerleading most closely resembles the sport of gymnastics, only without the
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.960]   mat and safety regulations, says former Massachusetts State Representative Peter Kutugian, who is
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.160]   trying to make cheerleading safer.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.960]   Kimberly Archer, founder of the National Cheer Safety Foundation, says that the emphasis
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.160]   is on "death-defying, gravity-defying stunts.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.460]   That's a long way from shaking pom-poms on the sidelines like I did in the '80s."
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.840]   If your daughter is five or six years old, you may think this advice doesn't apply.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.280]   Nobody is going to ask your daughter to do an airborne somersault anytime soon.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.940]   But there are long-term consequences to the choices that young girls make about which
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.080]   activities and sports they will participate in.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.480]   Ask any girl over eight years of age which sports she likes the most, and the answer
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.160]   will almost invariably be whatever sports her friends do.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.040]   If she joins midget poms at age six, she will probably want to carry on with her friends
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.840]   to junior cheer.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.120]   At age 10, when she's been with the same girls for four years and the coach is beginning
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.200]   to teach them some airborne stunts, it may be difficult for you to suggest that she switch
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.800]   to a safer sport.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.000]   She will say, "But all my friends are on the cheer squad!"
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.600]   And she may be right.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.280]   It's much easier to steer your six-year-old daughter in a healthy direction than it is
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.680]   to ask your 10-year-old daughter to change her sport and her friends.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.440]   Encourage your daughter to choose sports in which the emphasis is on what she does on
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.880]   the field of play, not on how she looks while she's doing it.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.400]   Archery, badminton, field hockey, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, and volleyball
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.360]   are all good choices by that criterion.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.720]   Cheerleading, dance team, and gymnastics may not be good choices.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.800]   The risks in cheerleading, dance team, and gymnastics often outweigh the benefits of
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.000]   exercise.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.200]   The focus on appearance, on looking cute, is often relentless.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.320]   Don't allow your daughter to specialize too early.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.640]   Specializing in a sport before the onset of puberty appears to increase the risk of physical
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.960]   injury and mental burnout.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.000]   According to an official policy paper from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.800]   those who participate in a variety of sports and specialize only after reaching the age
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.520]   of puberty tend to be more consistent performers, have fewer injuries, and adhere to sports
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.920]   longer than those who specialize early.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.080]   A second AAP committee examining the same question came to the same conclusion.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.440]   Young athletes who participate in a variety of sports have fewer injuries and play sports
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.840]   longer than those who specialize before puberty.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.000]   The National Athletic Trainers Association recently issued similar guidelines.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.360]   Kids should take at least two days a week off from their sport, should not specialize
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.900]   in one sport year-round, and should postpone specializing in one sport as long as possible.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:41.280]   In his book about girls who get hurt playing sports, Michael Sokolov writes that "nearly
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.000]   every injured athlete I met in the course of researching this book played one sport
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.760]   exclusively beginning at age 10 or younger."
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.640]   By the way, to make clear, this section here on specialization is not specific to girls.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.520]   It is applicable to girls, but it is not specific to girls.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.360]   This is the same advice that other parents need to be paying attention to with regard
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.780]   to boys.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:07.880]   And in our current kind of pedestalization of professional sports, there are many parents
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.480]   who are very much focusing on their children, their young children, specializing in a certain
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.740]   sport and taking advanced training in that sport with the hopes of reaching some very
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.480]   high level of performance in that sport.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.380]   I've spent a good amount of time digging into this just out of my interest in trying to
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.900]   shore up my knowledge of athletics and knowledge of sport and how to prepare children for that
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.520]   and things like that.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:43.360]   And universally this is condemned, universally by all trainers, coaches, everyone who's involved
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.540]   in that space who has the perspective of time.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:53.740]   It is a key thing that is promoted basically by parents who are intent on, in the best
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.840]   of cases, helping their children to specialize in a particular sport that they really want
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.600]   to help them go to college.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.440]   In the worst of cases, to live out some unfulfilled dream from the parent's own childhood, from
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.880]   the father's own childhood of what could have been if I had worked harder.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.560]   But children should not be specializing in a certain sport.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.360]   And so just broadly speaking, if you want your children to be strong and athletic, as
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.880]   I do, as we should, because, again, tying it with personal finance angle, it helps children
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   to be strong.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.160]   The competition is really important.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.920]   There's all kinds of lessons that can be learned.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.800]   All of these things are good things.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.880]   But the best approach is do not specialize in a sport.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   Play multiple sports for multiple seasons so that there's variety.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.800]   And there's huge cross-training benefits even for the long-term specialization.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.560]   There's huge cross-training benefits that come from playing a multitude of sports.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   I like the idea.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:54.260]   I heard recently, I was with a lady that my wife and I were having dinner with her.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.040]   And she said her family's rule was always this, you have to always be playing a sport.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.880]   You get to choose what it is, but you have to be playing a sport.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.200]   That's an appropriate thing.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.000]   And so if you look at the traditional schedule, at least in North America, where I'm familiar
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.240]   with it, where you have your fall sports, your winter sports, and your spring sports,
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.100]   this is an appropriate thing to have a short season, working on these sports skills during
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.280]   that time, and then having abundant amounts of time off.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.560]   Back to the book.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.840]   Don't allow your daughter to compete in the same sport year round.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.440]   In the 1980s, it wasn't possible to play the same sport year round.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.880]   There was soccer or field hockey in the fall, basketball in winter, and lacrosse or track
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.460]   or tennis in the spring.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:38.640]   But beginning in the early 1990s, club teams and travel teams began to grow in popularity.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.560]   Now it's common to find girls playing on a club team all year long.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.920]   But the evidence strongly suggests that specializing in one sport and competing in that sport year
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.900]   round greatly increases the risk of injury.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.880]   Each sport uses a particular group of muscles.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.280]   Overdeveloping one set of muscles while neglecting the others throws the body out of alignment.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.840]   There's a second reason, aside from the risk of injury, why your daughter should not compete
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.920]   in the same sport year round.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.280]   If she's playing the same sport winter, spring, summer, and fall, she's likely going
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.000]   to be with the same group of girls for a great deal of time.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.480]   Being respected and liked by those particular girls may become the highest priority in her
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   life.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.080]   If she sustains a minor injury, she will be less likely to mention her injury to anyone
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.140]   for fear that the doctor might restrict her participation.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:32.420]   Her enthusiasm for the sport itself may wane, but she won't consider quitting the team,
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.360]   because that's where her friends are.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.480]   The time commitment may be causing her grades to suffer, but she doesn't want to let her
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.200]   friends down.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.040]   It's all about balance.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.120]   Sports are great.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.720]   But when a particular sport becomes an obsession, it's time for you to step in.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.080]   You and your daughter have to find a sensible balance between risk and benefits.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.840]   As Sokolov observes, "We can't prevent every injury, but what we are currently doing
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.920]   is manufacturing them."
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.400]   If you intended for a girl to suffer a major injury, you would take away all her other
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.160]   sports before puberty, make her play her one sport all year round, and then you would just
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.320]   wait.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.420]   The earlier you make your intervention, the easier it will be.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.640]   Too many parents today go with the flow until it's too late.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.440]   We all want to be supportive of our daughter's interests.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.720]   What could be healthier than sports?
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.320]   Sokolov describes parents of highly motivated girls, parents who are supportive of their
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.800]   daughters but bewildered by the culture.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.040]   "The children, as often as not, are the ones leading the way," Sokolov found.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   "They do not so much put pressure on themselves as they absorb it from the youth sports culture.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.720]   The parents get subsumed in ways they never anticipated."
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.880]   We had no idea what we were getting into, says one parent.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.760]   You just feel your way as you go.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.460]   Don't be that parent.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.360]   Know what your daughter is getting into before it's too late.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.420]   Don't be intimidated by the coach or by the culture.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.720]   You know better than the coach what is best for your daughter.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.200]   Your coach has a different agenda.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.500]   He is concerned about winning.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.040]   If your daughter is injured, emotionally or physically, it's not his problem.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.460]   It's not going to keep him awake at night.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.560]   There are other girls who can take her place.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.040]   In the name of safety, don't allow your daughter to focus only on sports that involve
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.840]   the same muscle groups.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.240]   A girl who plays soccer in the fall and runs track in the winter and spring is running
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.080]   all the time.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.840]   Swimming would be a better winter sport for her, because swimming exercises different
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.460]   muscle groups, complementary to those used in running.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.560]   Many parents, especially in the United States, assume that early specialization in a particular
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.560]   sport will give their daughter a competitive advantage.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.240]   The evidence doesn't support that notion.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.960]   Colleen Hacker, who has served as a psychologist for U.S. women's soccer for more than 20 years,
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.320]   told Sokolove, "The big misconception is thinking that there is a linear connection
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.560]   between the development of a young athlete and the time spent being coached, attending
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.120]   organized practices, and playing organized games.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.880]   There's no support for that.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.940]   There may be a belief and a hope, but not evidence."
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.780]   The most successful athletes, the ones who make it to the Olympics, usually have a history
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:11.760]   of playing many sports, specializing only once they reach their teens.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.920]   Diversity of experience, cross-training, makes the body stronger, better coordinated, and
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.600]   less prone to injury.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.920]   Dr. Hacker expresses frustration that so many parents don't understand this basic reality
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.580]   about the developing human body.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:32.320]   This message, about the importance of athletic diversity, is not getting across, she says.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.920]   We need to encourage parents, coaches, sports leagues, and the culture itself to go back
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.400]   to multiple sports participation, and there needs to be real off-seasons with unstructured
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   play.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.420]   No adults, no rules, no leagues, no registration cards.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:52.000]   One of the best sentences a parent can utter is, "Go outside and play."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.160]   One of the worst is, "It's 9 a.m., get in the car, we're going to practice."
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.960]   Not all girls care about team sports.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.460]   Some girls do care passionately about team competition, about victory and defeat.
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.960]   For those girls, the traditional sports of soccer, basketball, and baseball or softball
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.520]   may be a good match.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.200]   But many girls are not particularly motivated by the opportunity to bash the other team.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.160]   If you have the sense that your daughter might be such a girl, try to expose her to a wide
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.520]   range of activities, including those that don't necessarily involve team competition
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.220]   – martial arts, fencing, and archery, to name three.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:33.400]   Some of these sports can be done in a team-competitive way, but they don't have to be, and often
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.800]   are not.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   A girl's knee is not a boy's knee.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.400]   The most popular team sports, such as soccer, baseball, and basketball, were developed mainly
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.640]   by men to be played by men and boys.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.640]   In the past 50 years, girls have begun playing these sports in record numbers.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.240]   For the most part, they are playing boys' sports according to boys' rules, and they
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.440]   are usually coached by men.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.440]   Few people have asked whether these sports should be modified to make them safe for girls.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.540]   Many people bristle when this question is raised.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:08.400]   "Are you suggesting that girls are not as tough as boys?" one parent asked me.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.400]   On the contrary, girls seem to be tougher.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.300]   If the criterion of toughness is how severe an injury is needed to knock the athlete out
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.980]   of the game, girls and young women appear to be more willing to play while injured compared
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.280]   to same-age boys.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.840]   But girls are different.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.680]   When researchers tested girls and boys at 8 years of age, they found that girls' quadriceps
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.540]   were very strong relative to their hamstrings, while boys had more of a balance between their
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.880]   hamstrings and quadriceps.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.800]   In case you're a bit weak on anatomy, the quadriceps is the foreheaded muscle on top
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.120]   of your thigh bone that straightens your leg.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.720]   The hamstrings are the muscles in the back of your thigh that bend your leg.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.200]   Puberty exacerbates these differences.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.480]   As a girl's hips widen, her Q angle increases.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:59.240]   The Q angle is the angle formed by the femur (the thigh bone) in relation to the vertical.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.760]   The widening of the pelvis that is a normal part of puberty in girls leads to a larger
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.000]   Q angle for young women.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.800]   As a result, activities that involve the quadriceps (activities such as running, jumping, or kicking
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:17.520]   a ball) create a more severe torque on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in girls
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.200]   than in boys.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.360]   Fatigue stresses the female knee differently and more severely compared with the male knee.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.400]   A girl's leg responds differently to a run-and-cut maneuver compared with a boy's executing
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.000]   the same maneuver.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.440]   As a result, girl gymnasts are more than five times as likely to injure their knees compared
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.360]   to boy gymnasts.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.280]   Girls playing basketball are more than twice as likely to rupture their ACL than boys playing
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.920]   basketball.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.800]   College women are four to six times more likely to injure their ACLs than men playing the
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.120]   same sport at the same level of competition.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.500]   The consequences of knee injuries can be significant and long-lasting.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:02.500]   If your daughter experiences an ACL injury, there is more than a 50/50 chance that she
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:08.360]   will develop significant arthritis in that knee within 7 to 20 years after the injury.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.400]   She may need a knee replacement by the time she's in her 30s.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.360]   Girls who are injured are more likely to be re-injured compared with boys who suffer the
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.900]   same injury playing the same sport.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.840]   This is not because girls are more fragile than boys, but because the entire culture
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:29.360]   of sport has developed around what works for boys, not what works for girls.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   For example, consider how coaches usually warm up their players before a game.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.200]   Generations of men have prepared boys before a game by having the boys run a few laps around
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.520]   the track or do some jumping jacks or simple stretching exercises.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.400]   That may be fine for boys, but it's not helpful for girls.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.880]   Orthopedic specialists designed a completely different warm-up routine based on girl-boy
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.000]   differences in anatomy.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.880]   The girls' warm-up routine should involve, among other things, running backward, as well
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.180]   as prone hamstring flexion exercises.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.760]   It doesn't cost any more money or time than the boys' routine.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.260]   It doesn't require any special equipment.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.520]   But it's different.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.260]   When girls do these "girl-specific" routines before practice and competition, the risk
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:20.520]   of ACL injury is reduced by an astonishing 88% compared with girls on comparable teams
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.320]   doing the traditional warm-up.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.640]   Ask the coaches of your daughter's team whether they are aware of this "girl-specific"
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.360]   warm-up and its proven benefits.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.960]   If they aren't, make sure they learn.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.320]   A girl's head is not a boy's head.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.180]   Samantha Furstenberg was a top-ranked high school lacrosse player.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.400]   She was sprinting with the ball toward the opposing goal in a high school game.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.580]   Three girls defending the goal tried to stop her.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:52.120]   At least one girl whacked her in the head with a lacrosse stick.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.680]   Samantha never lost consciousness, but she didn't feel right.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.200]   She sat out of the game for a few minutes, then she went back in.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   Samantha had suffered a concussion.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:08.060]   For several days, she was nauseated, felt dizzy, and had difficulty thinking clearly.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.560]   Her parents took her to see a specialist at Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.080]   When her symptoms persisted, Samantha and her parents traveled to consult another specialist
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.360]   at the University of Pittsburgh.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.880]   Even three weeks later, her symptoms were nearly as bad as they had been the day after
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.040]   the game.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.400]   She couldn't focus for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.520]   It took months for her to recover fully.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.600]   More than a year later, Samantha sustained a second concussion during a lacrosse match.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.760]   But she wouldn't give up the sport.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.840]   She was recruited by Colgate to play NCAA Division I lacrosse.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.680]   However, just a few days before she was to leave for Colgate, she bumped her head while
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.480]   tubing on a lake.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.340]   The headaches and dizziness returned.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:55.180]   After consulting with specialists, Samantha decided to leave the team and end her career
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.920]   as a competitive lacrosse player.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.800]   The risks were too great.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.320]   "Over the next few months, I struggled to define myself without lacrosse shaping who
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.960]   I was and what I did," she told me.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.480]   She decided to transfer from Colgate to Georgetown, and she took up long-distance running.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.800]   One year later, she ran the Marine Corps Marathon for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.240]   "But I definitely miss playing lacrosse," she told me at the time.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:26.160]   Most team sports are played by the same rules for girls and for boys at the high school
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.200]   and college level.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.640]   Lacrosse is a notable exception.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.240]   Boys are required to wear helmets while playing lacrosse.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.340]   Girls aren't.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.160]   The reason given is that boys' lacrosse is a contact sport.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.440]   Boys are allowed to make physical contact with other boys.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:47.200]   Girls' lacrosse is supposedly a non-contact sport because girls are not supposed to make
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.000]   intentional physical contact with other girls.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.640]   For most of the past century, research on sports-related head injuries meant research
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:59.400]   on sports-related head injuries for boys and men.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.960]   Even though girls and women have been playing competitive sports for decades, the first
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.940]   attempt at a thorough investigation of the risk for girls compared to boys wasn't published
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.520]   until 2007.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.800]   That study, undertaken by the NCAA in association with Ohio State University and based on data
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:21.720]   from 100 high schools and 180 universities across the United States, demonstrated that
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:28.560]   girls playing high school soccer have a risk of concussion 60% higher than boys.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:35.000]   Girls playing high school basketball have a risk of concussion 300% higher than boys.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.440]   Which NCAA has the highest concussion rate measured as a number of concussions per time
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.720]   rate?
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.840]   If you said football, you'd be wrong.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.400]   The college sport that carries the highest risk of concussion is women's ice hockey.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.120]   Women playing ice hockey have more than double the risk of concussion than men playing college
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.760]   football.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:01.840]   In every sport played by both girls and boys—basketball, soccer, ice hockey, lacrosse—girls' risk
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.720]   of concussion is significantly higher than the risk for boys.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.400]   One can imagine several possible explanations.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.800]   However, the most plausible explanation is that girls' heads are built differently
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.840]   from boys' heads.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.600]   Consider the lateral ventricles, which are basically big holes in the brain that contain
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:25.440]   nothing but cerebrospinal fluid, the watery liquid that encases and insulates the brain.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.120]   These fluid-filled holes in the brain are significantly bigger in boys than in girls,
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.840]   even after adjusting for any differences in overall body size.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.720]   The lateral ventricles act as fluid-filled hydraulic shock absorbers.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.840]   If a boy's head collides with a soccer ball, the odds of damage are lower than if a girl's
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.360]   head collides with the same soccer ball.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.200]   That makes sense if the boy's lateral ventricles are bigger than the girls'.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.920]   He has more empty space in his head to absorb the blow.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.860]   Some have suggested that maybe the reason that girls have a greater risk of concussion
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.280]   is merely because girls are, on average, smaller than boys.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.360]   That hypothesis doesn't fit the facts.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.720]   Girls are more likely to have a concussion compared with boys of the same size, and girls
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:15.880]   are more likely to suffer lasting cognitive deficits after concussion than boys are.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.760]   These sex differences are not attributable to differences in overall size or body mass,
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.040]   according to researchers who have carefully controlled for these variables.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:30.240]   Dr. Joseph Blyberg is a clinical neuropsychologist with a particular interest in head injuries.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.840]   He says that comparing the male and female skull and brain is "like comparing an SUV
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.600]   and a Volkswagen bug.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:43.120]   The same level of impact is probably not going to cause the same level of damage."
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.240]   What should we, as parents, do to minimize the risk of our daughters suffering a significant
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.240]   head injury?
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.960]   First, I think it's wise to try to steer your daughter away from the highest risk sports,
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.120]   such as ice hockey, figure skating, and gymnastics.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.660]   Second, if your daughter is going to play an intermediate risk sport, such as soccer
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:06.800]   or lacrosse or basketball, I think you should insist that she wear the new headband-style
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.520]   protective gear.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.200]   These devices look like overgrown headbands, but they act like helmets.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:20.800]   One example is the Full 90 (www.full90.com), which comes complete with an opening for your
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.640]   daughter's ponytail in the back.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.360]   Just make sure she doesn't regard the helmet as a license to kill.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.420]   Third, insist that the coach and staff have appropriate training in recognizing the signs
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:37.120]   of concussion, including sex differences in the presentation of concussion.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.840]   Male coaches, whose experience has been mostly with boys, may not be aware that girls are
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.200]   at higher risk for concussion.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.940]   They may not be as thorough in assessing a girl for concussion after she has been knocked
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.160]   in the head but hasn't lost consciousness.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:58.360]   I spoke with Samantha again in November 2019, ten years after our previous conversation.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.840]   What had happened in the years since?
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.800]   Samantha explained that her doctor advised her against returning to lacrosse or any sport
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.780]   with a high risk of head injury.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.680]   The danger of another concussion and lasting disability was just too great.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.040]   Instead, she plunged into endurance sports, and I use the word "plunge" literally.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.680]   In addition to running marathons, Samantha has completed three full Ironman competitions.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:26.600]   The Ironman competition begins with a 2.4-mile swim, followed by a 112-mile bike race, followed
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.280]   by a 26.2-mile marathon.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.340]   She now ranks in the top 5% of Ironman athletes worldwide.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.640]   She has also completed several half-Ironman competitions and a number of marathons, and
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.920]   she has coached girls high school lacrosse.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.920]   Samantha graduated from Georgetown with a double major in math and psychology.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.200]   She then went on to the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where she earned a master's
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.400]   degree.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.980]   After three years teaching sixth-grade math, she returned to graduate school to earn a
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:59.160]   second master's degree, this one in educational innovation, simultaneously with an MBA, both
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.100]   at the University of Virginia.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.440]   She hopes someday to launch her own K-12 school.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.460]   In her TEDxTalks, Samantha is frank about how she felt when she realized she would never
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.460]   play lacrosse again.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.460]   She felt that she had failed.
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:15.480]   A lot of championship brands in town, and you know Galpin Ford is one of them.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.040]   Number one in the world 29 years in a row.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.080]   I want you to ask for the general manager, number one guy there, Mike Schwartz, Matt
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.600]   MoneySmith here talking about Galpin.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.280]   We've done business for three plus decades.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.920]   They've done business in town for coming up on seven decades.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.320]   That's what we're talking about, a championship brand.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.620]   They have the inventory, over 800 vehicles ready for immediate delivery.
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.920]   You don't even have to hop off the 405 at Roscoe.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.080]   Find your vehicle online, they'll deliver it right to you.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   It's GalpinFord.com.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.200]   1-800-GO-GALPIN or hop off the 405 at Roscoe.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.600]   Ask for Mike Schwartz or Paul Ulbrich.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.180]   Nothing brought me joy, she said.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.800]   Being in marathons and Ironman events helped her to overcome that low.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:55.160]   I asked Samantha what advice she would have for other girls struggling to recover after
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   concussion.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.440]   "Listen to your doctor," she said.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.400]   "If they tell you to take a week off of school, do it.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.520]   Try to find someone else who has gone through it.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.460]   And remember, this too shall pass."
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.200]   A girl's bones are not a boy's bones.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.800]   When I was a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania back in the 1980s, we were
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:21.000]   taught that osteoporosis, brittle bones, is something that happens mostly to older women.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.360]   By the way, let me interrupt here for a moment.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:29.000]   Pay attention carefully to this point because the reason I do this kind of stuff, these
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.560]   kinds of topics, is to try to help you understand what you can do when your children are young.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.680]   As I've stated many times on the podcast, why don't I not talk about college savings
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.840]   accounts every day?
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.680]   Well, because with regard to preparing for education, it's inferior to basically every
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.200]   other thing that I can come up with.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.020]   Same thing here with medical stuff.
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:57.560]   We want to avoid osteoporosis at a late age, but listen to how early you have to be aware
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.760]   of this.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.560]   Back to the book.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.400]   When I was a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania back in the 1980s, we were
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:09.080]   taught that osteoporosis, brittle bones, is something that happens mostly to older women.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:16.800]   Today, doctors recognize that although osteoporosis usually manifests in women over 60 years of
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:23.280]   age, it is best understood as a disease that begins in childhood, caused by the failure
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.240]   to build sufficient bone in childhood and adolescence.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.680]   A girl makes most of her bone between 6 and 17 years of age.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.800]   By the time she's 17, a young woman has acquired more than 90% of all the bone mineral
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.020]   she will ever have.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.140]   After about age 24, it's mostly downhill.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:46.840]   I'm not saying that women in their 40s can't do anything about their bone density, but
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.160]   if your bones are strong at age 20, you're in good shape.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.800]   If your bone density is significantly below average at age 20, it's going to be a real
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.440]   struggle to make up the difference when you're in your 40s or 50s.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.640]   It's much easier for women over age 30 to maintain their bone density than to try to
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.040]   build bone they should have built when they were younger.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:11.840]   So, your daughter needs to exercise right, and she needs to eat right.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.120]   Researchers at Oregon State University randomly assigned children 6 to 8 years old either
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.520]   to jumping or stretching exercise.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:26.160]   The jumpers were asked to jump off a 2-foot box 100 times, 3 days a week for 7 months.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.560]   The stretchers did stretching exercises for an equivalent length of time.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.400]   There were no differences in bone density between the two groups of kids when they enrolled
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.780]   in the study, but at the end of the 7 months, the kids who had been assigned to the jumping
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:43.280]   exercise had significantly stronger bones than the kids who were assigned to the stretching
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.880]   exercise.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.480]   Even more important, significant improvements in bone density relative to the control group
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:56.320]   were still in evidence 7 years after the intervention ended, for girls as well as for boys.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:01.120]   In a separate study by Canadian researchers, 10-year-old girls were randomly assigned either
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:07.000]   to high-impact exercise, lots of jumping, for 10 minutes at a time, 3 times a week,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.760]   or to regular physical education for the same amount of time.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.480]   After 2 years, the girls who had been assigned to be jumpers had stronger bones than the
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:20.080]   girls who had been assigned to regular PE, even though there was no difference in bone
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.960]   density at the beginning of the study.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.160]   Every able-bodied girl can do jumping exercises.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.900]   It doesn't require any special athletic talent or any special training for staff or
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.260]   any expensive equipment.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.720]   So your daughter needs to exercise and so do you.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.580]   You have to practice what you preach.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.320]   It's great if your school's PE instructor is familiar with this research, but you can
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.900]   do these exercises with her yourself.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.520]   Don't rely on your daughter's school or the coach of her team to make sure she gets enough
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.900]   exercise.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.760]   It's your responsibility to get her out of the house, jumping up and down in the field
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.460]   or at the park or wherever.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.660]   The earlier you start, the better.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:02.420]   By 8 years of age, girls who are more active have significantly stronger bones than girls
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.280]   who are less active.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.180]   Let me interrupt here for a moment.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:12.340]   This is, if you remember in the episode where I talked about height, I emphasized high-impact
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.340]   activities.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:18.060]   Now, interestingly, this is one of those things that when I said it, some people I would guess
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.060]   would say, "Wait a second.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.060]   Why do we want high-impact activities?"
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.140]   As you get older, one of the things people are always looking for is, "I want low-impact
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.140]   activities, right?
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.380]   I want an elliptical trainer instead of running because it's lower impact."
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:33.400]   But it's really, really important that young people, young children and adolescents get
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.740]   lots of high-impact activity, and it's specifically important for what we're talking about here,
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.180]   for building the bone.
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.680]   As I understand it, not being a medical doctor, not even being an expert on this, just trying
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:49.180]   to consume what I can learn, as I understand it, bones respond to stress.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:53.180]   And so one of the most important things to do to build strong bones is to stress the
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.020]   bones quite a lot.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:46:00.580]   And stress can be stress through heavy weight, but it also should be the stress of heavy
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:01.860]   impact.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:07.180]   And so it's very important that children engage in lots of high-impact activity because the
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:12.580]   physical force involved of impact, of jumping off of a two-foot-tall box, is much, much
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:17.260]   higher really than even can be put on with heavy weight-bearing exercises.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.780]   So both are important, heavy weight-bearing exercises and impact.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:25.280]   But impact is that thing that continually creates little fractures in the bone, little
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:31.260]   micro fractures, and is the thing that can lead to growth.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:36.560]   So in the "Growing Taller" episode, I focused on how you can grow your bones and grow taller
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.360]   due to that impact.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.500]   We talked briefly about the micro fractures and stretching them out even for growth of
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.540]   bone potential beyond puberty.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.260]   That's not in any way accepted by medical science.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.820]   It's something that the bros are trying out.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.020]   And we'll tell if it works or not.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.540]   But for young people, for children, this jumping is really important.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:58.460]   So everything you can have that involves jumping is important.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.820]   Some of the things that I found that to work is, number one, children love to jump.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.820]   Like it's super fun.
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.500]   So get yourself some plyo boxes, ideally some soft ones, and stretch them out.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.460]   I find that my children love to jump up and down on the boxes and do the plyometric exercises.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.140]   They just think jumping is fun.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:19.660]   And then I always make sure that they jump off the plyo boxes as well as jumping on to
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.740]   try to get as much impact as possible.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.580]   And I build it up to the highest height possible.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:29.980]   I've also been teaching my children to do parachute landing falls with the idea that,
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.500]   again, they can sustain higher levels of impact and encourage them to jump off repeatedly
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.540]   so that they build bones.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:40.160]   And then repetitive jumping exercise, things like jump ropes are amazing for the body.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.120]   Just lots and lots of jumping, amazing for the muscles, amazing for the body.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.940]   So get your children, especially your girls, jump ropes and get them on there every day.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.240]   As with every other aspect of development we've considered here, the rule is this,
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.620]   everything in moderation.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.340]   Girls who over-exercise and get too skinny put themselves at risk for stress fractures.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.980]   That's especially true for girls in track, gymnastics, and cheerleading.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:06.260]   Too much of one kind of exercise without cross-training is not a good thing.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.820]   As for eating right, forget everything you've learned from studies of boys or men.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.580]   Diet doesn't seem to matter as much in building boys' bones compared to girls'.
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:20.980]   Girls, for starters, must drink plenty of milk and avoid cola beverages.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.300]   Consumption of cola beverages is linked to lower bone density and fractures in girls.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.220]   This appears to be true of older women as well.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:32.700]   Drinking soft drinks is associated with brittle bones in teenage girls, but not in teenage
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.100]   boys.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.920]   Girls who drink plenty of milk have stronger bones compared with girls who are equally
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.860]   well-nourished but who don't drink much milk.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:45.580]   Other sources of calcium in the diet do not appear to be able to compensate for not drinking
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.580]   milk.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.240]   There may be more to the story than just calcium.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.420]   Recent research suggests that there are some as-yet-unknown factors in milk that help to
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.380]   build strong bones, especially in girls.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.500]   Soy milk, rice milk, and almond milk are increasingly popular.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:05.000]   While some dairy farms are closing due to lack of demand for cow's milk, manufacturers
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.340]   of plant-based alternatives report difficulty keeping up with the surging appetite for their
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.340]   product.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.800]   I encounter parents who believe that these alternatives deliver nutritional benefits
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.780]   compared to real milk.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.940]   Those parents are mistaken.
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.160]   One team of pediatricians reported cases of toddlers right here in the United States who
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.940]   showed signs of advanced malnutrition.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:31.100]   Quasiorcor and Ricketts normally encountered only among severely impoverished families
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.660]   in the third world.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.040]   The parents were well-educated and caring.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.100]   They thought they were doing the best thing for their child by giving their child soy
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:42.000]   milk or rice milk rather than actual milk.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.120]   The authors note that it is misleading to use the term "milk" for these beverages.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.880]   They prefer the term "soy beverage" rather than "soy milk."
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.620]   These authors note that the parents of one toddler assumed that they were providing their
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:57.680]   toddler with superior nutrition because of the fortified status and relatively high cost
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.240]   of the beverage.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:05.520]   But the beverage in question, like many rice, soy, or almond milks, provided less than one
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.840]   tenth the protein found in cow's milk, 1.7 grams of protein per liter, compared with
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.520]   33 grams of protein per liter in cow's milk.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.420]   Your daughter needs to drink milk.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.800]   Milk from a cow.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   Or a goat.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.480]   Soy milk doesn't count.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.200]   Almond milk doesn't count.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   If necessary, you could let her drink flavored milk.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.760]   Girls who drink flavored milk do not become fatter than girls who drink unflavored milk.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.920]   Girls who are lactose intolerant need to take special measures.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:39.160]   So, give your 5-year-old daughter her very own little bottle of strawberry-flavored milk.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.880]   Don't wait until puberty.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.240]   In one study, investigators measured bone density in 8-year-olds, then followed the
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.880]   children until they were 16 years old.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:53.760]   Girls who had brittle bones at age 8 were significantly more likely to break their bones
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:59.840]   by the age of 16 compared with girls who had strong bones at age 8.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.960]   Let me add here just a couple of quick comments on the milk thing that may be helpful to some
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.200]   people.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   If your family is already a family of milk drinkers, great.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.800]   What's interesting is that there are a lot of people who used to be milk drinkers that
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   stopped.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   I was one of those.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.080]   When I was younger, we didn't have milk every day with every meal.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.800]   That wasn't kind of the family culture, but I wasn't discouraged from drinking milk.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:25.280]   I stopped drinking milk when I was in my teens because I decided that milk was making me
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.680]   fat and I was concerned about the impact of dairy on acne.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.760]   And so I stopped drinking milk because it was just too many calories and I didn't want
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   to be fat.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.560]   My wife didn't ever come from a milk-drinking family, and so we weren't in the habit of
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.560]   drinking milk.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.760]   I also used to be super suspicious of conventionally raised milk.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.560]   I got super suspicious of the hormone risks, the risks of all the hormones that the cows
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.080]   are given, and I got really worried about that.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.720]   And over the years, I became very suspicious of milk.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:00.560]   I believe now that, again, my understanding as a layman, I believe that I was wrong to
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.000]   be as suspicious as I was back then.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.280]   The hormones and other issues of things that I was worried about are not as big of a risk
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.440]   as I thought they were.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.760]   And milk should be something that should be consumed consistently.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.240]   I used to make fun of the got milk ads about calcium also, about the bioavailability of
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.240]   calcium.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.920]   I thought, well, there's things you read from the medical people about how the calcium doesn't
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   get absorbed.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.420]   And so I thought it was all a bunch of bunk.
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.120]   I believe now that I was wrong.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.920]   So I think we should encourage milk consumption.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.680]   It seems to me that milk consumption, from what I understand, it's important to, whenever
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:39.840]   possible, pair milk consumption with vitamin D. Obviously, we want lots of sunshine, and
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:44.000]   so perhaps your body can create vitamin D, but most people are vitamin D deficient.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.560]   So taking a vitamin D supplement alongside the milk, as I understand it, is a very smart
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.160]   thing to do and really helps in the absorption of calcium.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.360]   And it really does help our children's bones to grow better.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.400]   And then in order to really be useful, it should be something that is served regularly.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.520]   So I grew up in a family where we never drank milk with meals, and I would go to some places
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.400]   where people would say, "Hey, would your children like milk?"
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.120]   And I was like, "No, we wouldn't like milk."
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:11.360]   I now think that children having milk with their meal is probably one of the best things
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:17.680]   that they can do to consume the protein, have the calcium, and have the calories that come
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.880]   from milk.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.440]   So you may have to deal with lactose issues separately.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.980]   There are some people who have issues with that.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.060]   What I do is make as much as possible raw milk.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.760]   That's a separate controversial subject, but it seems persuasive to me, the benefits of
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.120]   raw milk as compared to pasteurized milk.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:38.640]   So if possible, get yourself a source of raw milk, but you do your own research on that
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.580]   and feed it consistently.
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:44.240]   So a little bit before every meal and get your children in the habit of that, especially
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.240]   your girls.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.240]   It's really important.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.520]   The current craze for soy milk here and almond milk there needs to be ended.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.120]   Oh, and by the way, milk is one of your cheapest sources of high quality calories that you
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   can get.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:59.400]   For your teenage boys who are trying to put on weight, while the GOMAD diet, the G-O-M-A-D
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.720]   gallon of milk a day diet is not the perfect thing, it's a time proven way for your teenage
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.380]   boys to bulk up.
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.760]   The promise and perils of exercise.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.600]   The evidence suggests that girls who are involved in sports are more likely to remain active
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.620]   through adolescence, when other girls generally become less active.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:22.060]   Girls who are involved in vigorous physical activities, including but not limited to
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:27.060]   organized sports, also appear to be at lower risk for becoming depressed.
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:33.280]   And that protective effect holds true regardless of body mass index or even fitness.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:38.640]   In other words, an overweight girl who exercises regularly is less likely to become depressed
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.720]   than an equally heavy girl who doesn't exercise.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:46.120]   And girls who exercise regularly are less likely to feel tired.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.840]   Exercise has all sorts of benefits that have nothing to do with how much you weigh or how
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.200]   you look.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.360]   But some girls exercise too vigorously or for the wrong reasons.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:03.440]   One study of girls age 9 to 16 found that 46% of girls want to look like a female celebrity.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.200]   And that's part of the reason why they exercise.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.200]   That's not a healthy motivation.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.680]   It's other referenced rather than self referenced.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.980]   The goal should be to help girls have realistic and healthy body images and recognize the
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.800]   importance of physical activity for overall health and well-being, not just for appearance
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.640]   focused reasons.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.840]   Lauren Fleshman is a veteran of collegiate sports.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:31.920]   As an undergraduate at Stanford, she won five NCAA titles in track and field and was a 15
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.620]   time All-American.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:37.940]   She observed firsthand other female athletes who were starving themselves.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:42.360]   She blamed that on a sports system built by and for men.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.760]   I certainly agree that when young women are coached by men who have had no training in
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.320]   the gender-specific strategies that work best for girls and women, and who may have inaccurate
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:55.060]   stereotyped beliefs about female athletes, such as the mistaken belief that female athletes
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.440]   must be rail thin in order to win, then bad things often happen.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:03.520]   Many girls are on the edge of an unhealthy obsession when it comes to exercise.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.960]   Some girls fall over that edge.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.560]   Obsessive exercise can be hazardous to your health.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.920]   Researchers at San Diego State University interviewed girls at six different California
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:17.960]   high schools and found that 18% of girls playing interscholastic sports reported disordered
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.320]   eating attitudes or behaviors.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.620]   Almost one in four, 23.5%, had irregular menstrual periods.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:29.940]   Almost as many girls, 21.8%, had low bone density.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:34.080]   In another study, young women who participated in sports where leanness is desirable, sports
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:38.880]   such as gymnastics, were almost twice as likely to have irregular menstrual periods compared
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:43.960]   to young women participating at the same level of competition in sports such as softball,
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.840]   where leanness is not essential.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:51.320]   24.8% of girls in lean sports compared with 13.1% of girls in other sports.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:57.400]   We discussed the athletic triad, the association of excessive exercise with brittle bones,
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.720]   disordered eating, and the loss of the menstrual period back in chapter three.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.400]   I really want you to get this book and read it.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.720]   I'm not going to go back to chapter three.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:09.280]   I'm already sharing an enormous amount here from this chapter on the body.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:15.960]   But this topic of irregular menstruation for young women is enormously important.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:22.320]   We are facing an absolute fertility crisis, and this particular factor of the impact of
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:28.860]   sports on regular menstruation for women is something that I find just in personal conversations
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:34.080]   with people struggling, with couples struggling with fertility, is fairly common and fairly
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   prevalent.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:41.480]   And losing your fertilities to a stupid sport and becoming so excessively skinny that your
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:46.120]   body can no longer menstruate such that you have to spend tens of thousands of dollars
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:51.000]   in your 20s and 30s for every one of your babies seems to me one of the stupidest financial
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.140]   decisions that you can possibly make.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:57.480]   It's very annoying as a financial planner to end working with couples who aren't able
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:01.320]   to conceive babies naturally without external intervention.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:07.480]   It's very annoying to have to reorganize the entire budget to spend tens of thousands of
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.980]   dollars for every baby conceived.
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:14.740]   That makes the cost of having children enormous, and it wrecks all kinds of other things.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:19.880]   And a significant component of it can be avoided through information and proper practice.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.300]   So don't let your daughters get so skinny that their bodies stop working.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.920]   It's absurd and it has to end.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.860]   On the one hand, you don't want your daughter to obsess about her weight.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.480]   On the other hand, girls who are out of shape are at greater risk not only for overweight
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.560]   and obesity, but also for depression and fatigue.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.160]   How can you encourage the right kind of healthy exercise without pushing your daughter over
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.360]   the edge?
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.200]   In order to answer those questions, we need to understand the role that culture plays
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:50.400]   and the role played by something psychologists call social contrast effects.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:55.040]   What do girls in Chicago have in common with Hopi girls in Arizona?
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:59.000]   Carol Cronin-Weisfeld and her colleagues wanted to understand how much of the difference in
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.720]   girls' and boys' interest in sports is due to culture, and how much might be due
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:07.920]   to other factors, perhaps psychological rather than cultural.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.360]   They decided to watch girls in Chicago playing dodgeball, first girls against girls, then
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.320]   girls and boys together.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:20.280]   Then they did the same thing with Native American children on a Hopi reservation in Arizona.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:24.800]   When Chicago girls played against other Chicago girls, there was lots of variation in the
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.200]   style and quality of play.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.680]   Some of the girls were really serious about the game.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:34.200]   As soon as play began, those girls would adopt what coaches call the "athletic stance"
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:39.160]   – knees bent, arms flexed, eyes focused, ready to jump for the ball.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   When play got underway, these girls were real competitors.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.040]   They would jump for the ball, grab it, sometimes even wrestling the ball away from another
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.040]   girl.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.360]   The girls who were most engaged were, not surprisingly, the highest skilled girls at
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.120]   playing the game.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:56.760]   Other girls were not particularly excited about the game, and certainly were not jumping
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.120]   and grabbing for the ball.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.840]   Again, not surprisingly, these girls were less skilled.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:06.280]   Weisfeld and colleagues found the same variation in engagement and skill among the Native American
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.400]   girls in Arizona.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.360]   When boys were brought into the gym, so that there were an equal number of girls and boys
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.960]   playing, the picture changed dramatically.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:21.160]   The Hopi girls still participated in the game, but the high-skilled girls no longer demonstrated
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.560]   their skill.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.800]   They didn't want to fight the boys for the ball.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.480]   When the boys were playing, the high-skilled Hopi girls looked very much like the low-skilled
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.720]   girls.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.880]   Most of the high-skilled Chicago girls didn't even hang around for the game when boys were
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.880]   playing.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.000]   Instead, they left the playing area altogether and went off in little groups to dance with
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.960]   one another or to snack on potato chips.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.460]   Most of these kids, girls and boys, were 12 years old.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:50.920]   In this study, the average girl in Chicago and in Arizona was bigger and taller than
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.200]   the average boy in Chicago and in Arizona, respectively.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.840]   Which is not surprising because 12-year-old girls are often bigger and taller than 12-year-old
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   boys.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.720]   Nevertheless, the high-skilled girls seemed to lose much of their enthusiasm for the game
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.960]   when boys came on the court.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.440]   In a peculiar twist, the investigators, who had previously rated the skill of each girl
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.800]   and each boy in single-sex competition, arranged a game in which high-skilled girls played
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.160]   against low-skilled boys.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.920]   The girls didn't do well.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.680]   They didn't try hard.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.820]   Only one Chicago girl and only one Hopi girl seemed to be comfortable fighting the boys
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.560]   for the ball.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:37.100]   This study illustrates what psychologists call "group contrast effects."
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:41.440]   When members of two different groups are present, members of each group tend to exaggerate the
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.840]   differences between the two groups.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:48.600]   Boys and girls categorize themselves as "boys" and "girls," respectively, and will be
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.320]   more likely to behave according to the prevailing cultural stereotype.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.800]   When girls are around, boys are less willing to exhibit any behavior that might be considered
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.040]   feminine.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.720]   When boys are around, girls are reluctant to exhibit behaviors that might be considered
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720]   "boyish."
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.320]   I've seen this phenomenon myself while visiting co-ed schools and single-sex schools with
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.960]   regard to displays of affection for the teacher, for example.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.560]   At co-ed elementary and middle schools, it's common to find girls giving the teacher hugs.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.160]   But you won't find many boys hugging the teacher.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.020]   At co-ed schools, hugging the teacher is something girls do.
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:28.480]   But if that school adopts the single-sex format, with boys in all-boys classrooms, all of a
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.000]   sudden you'll find boys hugging the teacher as though it's the most natural thing in the
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.640]   world for a boy to do, which, of course, it is, as long as there aren't any girls around.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.700]   Likewise, in the study of Hopi girls and Chicago girls, if grabbing the ball out of somebody
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:47.500]   else's hands is perceived as something boys do, then girls will be less likely to do that
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.180]   if boys are present.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:53.560]   When the girls are by themselves, you see a wider range of individual differences, from
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.360]   the competitive athlete to the disengaged girl.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.020]   When boys are added into the mix, group contrast effects kick in, and many of the girls act
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.420]   more "girly," less competitive, more talkative.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:11.060]   The co-ed format, especially in sports, has the effect of homogenizing the girls.
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:16.920]   Variations among the girls diminish, and differences between the sexes are exaggerated.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.160]   And here's what I found strangest of all about the Chicago, Arizona study.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.640]   When the investigators asked the girls which format they preferred, all-girls or co-ed,
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:32.800]   the girls in both locations overwhelmingly said that they preferred the co-ed format,
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.140]   even though the video showed clearly that the girls were less engaged and did much less
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.240]   well when the boys were playing.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.160]   That's important.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:47.620]   Asking girls which format they prefer isn't a reliable indicator of which format is actually
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:52.000]   best for them in terms of athletic engagement.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.320]   What girls say they prefer may not always be what is best for them.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:00.860]   Nowadays, it wouldn't be cool for most girls to say, "No, I would prefer to do my physical
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.820]   exercise just with other girls, no boys."
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:10.640]   Such a comment might make a girl vulnerable to the charge of being, God forbid, a prude.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.200]   But there's good reason to believe that for most girls, particularly after the onset of
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:21.220]   puberty, the all-girls format is usually preferable for physical activity.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.520]   Part of this has to do with the "swimsuit becomes you" phenomenon we considered in
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520]   chapter 1.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.300]   "When the boys are around, you can feel them looking at you," one girl said.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.780]   Some girls might worry about how they look in the eyes of the boys.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:41.140]   Other girls are simply annoyed by the way boys rate girls' bodies, as some boys do.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:45.780]   There is some evidence that girls from kindergarten through high school are more likely to exercise
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.200]   when offered a single-sex gym class rather than a co-ed class.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:55.160]   Before 1980, it was common for girls and boys to take their physical education classes separately,
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.900]   even if all other classes were mixed.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:02.620]   Today, most co-ed schools in the United States have co-ed PE classes.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:06.620]   There are many other reasons why this may not be such a good idea beyond the changes
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.260]   just discussed.
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:11.920]   The best way to provide instruction in physical education may be different for girls than
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.380]   it is for boys.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:19.380]   For example, one strategy that is often effective for girls is to have one girl, more experienced
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.840]   in the sport, teach the sport to a novice girl.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.640]   The more experienced girl is more likely to be sensitive to the needs of the less experienced
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.060]   girl and more interested in really helping her to learn the sport.
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:35.060]   Girls seem more interested in sharing their knowledge for the sake of sharing, whereas
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.280]   boys are generally more interested in showing off.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:44.220]   So this strategy, pairing older kids one-on-one with younger kids, works less well for boys.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:48.020]   The reasons kids play sports are often different for girls than boys.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:53.420]   For many boys, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat is what sports are all about.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:57.980]   But many girls may be more interested in developing their personal capacities through sport than
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:04.060]   they are in establishing personal superiority over others, according to a report from researchers
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.320]   at the University of Montana.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.260]   Many boys engage in sports because they want to win.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:15.300]   The best way to get them engaged in a PE class is to have a real game with clearly defined
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.020]   winners and losers.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:21.820]   Though some girls have that same competitive drive, for other girls, a win-at-all-costs
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:26.920]   mentality may be less appealing and may even push them away from sports.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.340]   Girls are, on average, more likely to enjoy sports when the emphasis is on having fun
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.360]   and getting in shape rather than on beating the other team.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.260]   You can begin to appreciate how a physical education program with girls and boys in the
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:45.340]   same gym class might result in zero-sum choices for the instructor.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:50.220]   If you, the instructor, organize a winner-takes-all competition, then you may engage many of the
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.740]   boys, but you risk disengaging many of the girls.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.460]   But if you structure the class along the lines of "everybody gets a trophy, everybody's
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:01.380]   a winner," then you may lose at least some of the boys.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.740]   The single-sex format can broaden horizons for boys as well as for girls.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:09.500]   Again, group contrast effects may be part of the explanation.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:13.780]   Several years ago, I was interviewing a boy at an all-boys school in Perth, Western Australia.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:18.100]   I asked him whether he saw any advantages to attending a boys' school.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.900]   Was he doing anything at the boys' school that he wouldn't be doing at a comparable
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.220]   co-ed school?
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.180]   "Ballet," he responded without hesitation.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:28.000]   This young man was the top football player at the school.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.660]   We're talking Australian rules football, of course.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.460]   He was tall and muscular.
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.980]   But there's no way I'd do it if the classes were mixed.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:39.220]   He explained that when it's just guys in the ballet studio, and some of those guys are
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:44.340]   his teammates, then it's okay to work on balance and poise and fourth position.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:48.460]   If girls were around, you wouldn't feel as comfortable doing a deep plie, I asked.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.460]   He shook his head.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:52.420]   "I just wouldn't be there," he said.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:55.660]   By the way, just to insert, this happened to me.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.780]   When I was in college, I tried to press myself to do different things.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:02.840]   So I took a salsa dancing class, which was great, super fun.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:08.660]   And I had a friend of mine who was an amazingly athletic, coordinated guy, and he was a dancer.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.260]   He did ballet.
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:15.380]   And I had always judged ballet as something stupid and girly and never going to be involved.
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:19.620]   Then I started researching the topic of ballet, and I discovered, "Wait a second.
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:21.140]   This is amazingly athletic.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:24.300]   And you look at male ballet dancers, they're just incredible athletes."
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.820]   And so I thought, "Well, Joshua, you want to get some exercise.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:31.380]   You want to get stronger and whatnot.
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.380]   Why not?
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.380]   Let's try it out."
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.060]   So I signed up for a ballet class, and I went the first day.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.580]   And it was a mixed ballet class, and I walked out the door.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:43.500]   I never could come back, because everything about it, where I was always happy to...
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.700]   I have no problem being a total novice at something.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.460]   I have no problem being terrible at something.
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   I'm pretty good at that.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.980]   I don't have a lot of pride associated with that stuff.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.220]   Just get in and start learning it.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:59.060]   But in a mixed class format of ballet, where you're just terrible at it as a guy, I could
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.060]   not do it.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.340]   I couldn't do it in front of girls.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:05.220]   Whereas if it had been a male-only ballet class, I probably would have done it and learned
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.820]   something and gotten flexible and learned to dance, and it would have been good for
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.780]   my overall athletic development.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:14.580]   So I would concur with what that guy said.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.880]   I have found that parents are often receptive to the idea of single-sex physical education
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.900]   for teenagers, provided that the same facilities and resources are available to the girls and
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.140]   boys.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:28.100]   That willingness seems to arise in part because so many parents are concerned about the sexual
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.980]   overtones that might kick in when teenage girls and boys engage in strenuous physical
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.020]   activity in close proximity.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.740]   Too much heavy breathing.
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:41.740]   But many parents balk at the idea of single-sex physical education for younger kids.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:45.500]   I don't see the point of separating girls and boys for gym class in second grade, one
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.100]   parent told me.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.780]   Seven-year-olds don't have a sexual agenda at that age, do they?
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.740]   She asked.
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.700]   Seven-year-olds hopefully do not have a sexual agenda, but they certainly do have gendered
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.020]   notions about physical activity.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:02.580]   As I noted earlier, seven-year-old boys are more likely to boast about their imaginary
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:06.300]   physical prowess, and seven-year-old girls may believe them.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.300]   So girls get the notion very early that the gym and the playing field are the boys'
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.300]   domain.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:15.580]   An all-girls physical education program, beginning in kindergarten, might enable more girls to
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:18.780]   take ownership of the whole domain of physical activity.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:23.740]   We need to help our daughters take that ownership, to feel comfortable on the playing field.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:28.620]   By the time kids reach adolescence, boys are much more comfortable than girls on basketball
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:32.620]   courts, playing fields, streets, local parks, and other public spaces conducive to physical
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:36.780]   activity, according to researcher Dr. Candy James.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:41.060]   Girls often see these places as belonging to boys, and they fear being teased, excluded,
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.460]   or hurt if they try to join in.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:49.460]   Instead, they sit on the periphery as passive spectators or avoid these active spaces altogether.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:53.660]   Many of the girls surveyed by Dr. James said they would use their school basketball courts
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:57.780]   if the courts were located where boys could not watch them.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:02.820]   Work with your school to ensure that all-girls athletic options and all-girls physical education
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.300]   are available.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:08.780]   But the all-girls format won't be so great if you have a male instructor screaming at
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.180]   the girls.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:14.740]   We parents need to insist that the instructors who are teaching our daughters understand
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:20.860]   and respect gender differences in order to help each girl to fulfill her physical potential.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:26.420]   In her book, Perfect Girls, Starving Daughters, Courtney Martin describes her own years-long
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:31.420]   struggle to accept her body, to move beyond her obsession with what she ate and how she
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.540]   looked.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.660]   Her body was her enemy.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:38.940]   She began to glimpse a resolution to her struggle one day while taking a yoga class.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.300]   The instructor told her to "meet your body where it is."
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.700]   This was a new concept for her.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.540]   Meet your body where it is.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.700]   Be comfortable in your body.
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:54.820]   Work on your fitness, but be at home in your own body.
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:58.980]   Psychologist Madeline Levine writes that many communities overvalue a very narrow range
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.020]   of academic and extracurricular accomplishments.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.900]   Many parents sign their daughters up for soccer or basketball without investigating whether
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:09.100]   those sports are really the best choice for their daughter.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:13.300]   For some girls, yoga or aerobics might be a better way of connecting with their own
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.300]   bodies.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.300]   Or maybe canoeing.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.820]   I recall Shannon, a teenage girl from my own practice, who discovered on her own at the
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.460]   age of 13 that she had a passion for canoeing and kayaking.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:27.820]   Her father asked if she wanted to join a kayaking club so that she could compete against other
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.180]   teenagers.
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.360]   She had no interest in competing.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.300]   She didn't want to beat anybody.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:37.460]   She just enjoyed the feeling of being on the river, gliding along the water on her own
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.000]   power.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.020]   During the summer between 10th and 11th grade, Shannon spent two weeks canoeing the Snake
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.280]   River in the Yukon Territory, Canada, with a group of other girls.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.780]   She told me later how much she valued that experience.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:54.100]   "We spent all day every day either canoeing or portaging our canoe.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:57.960]   By the time it was evening and time to make camp, I was so hungry.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.580]   You can't believe how good fresh river trout tastes after you've spent six hours canoeing
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.180]   and two hours portaging your canoe and your gear."
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:11.040]   Then after a pause, she said, "It's the most spiritual thing I've ever done.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.780]   Out there in the wilderness, on the river, where there's no trace of anything human,
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:18.420]   it's so easy to believe in something more.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.980]   Paddling on the river became a kind of prayer for me, you know?"
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:27.100]   I nodded, because that's what doctors do, but I wasn't sure I understood.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:33.520]   "The physical becomes spiritual," Shannon said, and then shook her head as though she
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:39.460]   had said something wrong, or as though she were on the brink of tears.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:43.320]   And thus concludes chapter six of the book Girls on the Edge by Dr. Leonard Sachs.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.940]   I would commend it to you.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.420]   It's a great book.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:50.820]   His book, Boys Adrift, was one that a listener begged me to read, sent me multiple emails
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.260]   until I finally acquiesced, and then I went ahead and found it so good that I followed
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.020]   on with Girls on the Edge.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.620]   There are other, I'm sure, other books, and I'm sure there's controversy about all that
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.620]   stuff that he said.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.620]   Who knows?
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:11.600]   The point is, recognize that your girls need to develop their bodies, just like boys need
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.300]   to develop their height.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:20.520]   And if you are able to raise daughters who are strong, who are athletic, who are comfortable
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:27.420]   in their bodies, and who have strong athletic bodies themselves, that confidence will probably
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:32.700]   have a similar effect to the confidence that boys come with height.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.660]   Now, I can't prove any of that.
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:39.820]   And we go back to the question of, are people, tall people, do they make more money because
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:45.020]   of heightism and kind of a social perception, or is it a cognitive thing?
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:50.180]   Again, the researchers, some of them claim that height is indicative of cognitive development,
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.180]   so probably it's that tall people are slightly smarter than people who are not tall.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.540]   I don't know.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:15:00.360]   All I know is that all of us are attracted to strong and confident women.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.940]   And so if we want our daughters to become strong and confident women, then we need to
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:09.620]   think about the environment that they're raised in and think about how do we nurture strength
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.260]   and confidence?
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.260]   It's not the only thing.
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:15.660]   There are many other things, everything from social abilities and character qualities and
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.760]   physical appearance and kindness and all kinds of other factors, but we need to give careful
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.760]   attention to it.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.020]   So I didn't want to just ignore the girls in that particular episode.
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:30.900]   I want you to know that we need to make certain of physical development for both our boys
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:36.500]   and our girls, but that we need to be certain that we don't let our androgynous culture
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:41.420]   that claims that there's no differences between boys and girls keep us from doing what's right.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.540]   Undoubtedly, if you take this message and go to your local institutions, unless your
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:49.740]   institutions are enlightened, undoubtedly, you're going to immediately get in the thick
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.540]   of the swamp with, "We can't treat boys different from girls.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.240]   We can't treat girls different from boys."
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.240]   Don't let it...
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:02.140]   Again, I described earlier, if my Christian homeschool co-op isn't, if the moms in there
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.860]   are not willing to consider having boys-only classes or girls-only classes, not even willing
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:12.860]   to consider it, then you're probably going to face similar levels of resistance, no matter
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.620]   in your institution.
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:15.900]   But that doesn't matter.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.660]   What matters is, is it true or is it not true?
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:25.500]   And then if it's true, then for the sake of those we love, you and I have a responsibility
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:30.300]   to press in, fulfill our responsibilities as leaders of society, and do what is in the
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.900]   best interest of our children, regardless of whether it's popular or not.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.700]   So, I hope these ideas have helped you, and I hope that you have a great day.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.100]   I'll be back with you soon.
