[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   I would like to call your attention this evening to the words found in Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:16.560]   Romans in chapter 8, reading verses 28, 29, and 30. From verse 28 to verse 30, in the
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.440]   eighth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. "And we know that all things work together
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.080]   for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.000]   whom he did foreknow, he also did predestine it to be conformed to the image of his Son,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.080]   that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestine
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.520]   it, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.760]   them he also glorified." Now here we come again to another subsection
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.280]   in this marvelous progression of arguments and subsections which the great apostle works
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.040]   out in this wonderful eighth chapter of this epistle to the Romans. We have seen, we saw
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.320]   at the very beginning how it is divided into these various sections, or if you like, subsections.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.480]   Only one great theme which he puts in different ways, marshals different arguments, and provides
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:41.200]   us with different reasons for having a full assurance, an absolute certainty of our ultimate,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.800]   final, complete salvation and deliverance from everything that sin has ever done to
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.760]   us. Now that's the controlling theme of the whole chapter. And here I say we move on now
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:06.040]   to another form of this one great argument. The fact that we are moving on is introduced
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:15.600]   by the word "and." And this, I think, serves two main functions here. It, first
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.680]   of all, links it with the main argument, as I say, of the whole chapter. In other words,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.600]   he is in effect saying, "Well, another or an additional reason for this is the one I'm
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.640]   about to put to you." It's another chain in this great link which is being forged in
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.520]   order to give us this final and ultimate assurance. I think that's probably the main connection.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.640]   But of course it has a subsidiary connection, a secondary, and a second connection also.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.940]   And that is that it is, in a sense, a continuation of what he has just been saying in the immediately
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.160]   preceding section, which we've been considering recently, about the Spirit helping our infirmities
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.200]   and making intercession for us with groaning which cannot be uttered. There is no doubt
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:22.640]   but that this new statement does still have that in mind. But I'm here to argue that
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.760]   the main connection is with the series of arguments which he's been developing and
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.060]   deploying right through the whole chapter. I make that point because we find that a distinguished
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:48.180]   commentator like Dr. Charles Hodge would link this 28th verse solely with the previous statement,
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.020]   with the previous paragraph. It's interesting that he puts this verse in with the other
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.500]   verses in his subdivision of this chapter. It's always a bold thing to disagree with
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.340]   him but I feel that one has to do so, that there's something beyond that. It certainly,
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.580]   as I say, has its connection, its relationship to that. But there's much more than that
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.020]   here. The very last phrase in this 28th verse takes us to something altogether bigger and
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.620]   higher, and that is, "To them who are the called according to his purpose," which
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:32.780]   he goes on then to elaborate. So I say that we must regard this as essentially a new subsection,
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:41.620]   though it has this connection with what he has just been saying. That, of course, is
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.660]   one of the characteristics of the Apostle's style. We've seen him doing that so frequently.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.500]   That's why I always feel a good comparison to use in describing the Apostle's style
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:06.420]   is the comparison of a great symphony, how you get the themes hinted at, and then how
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.380]   each one is taken up in turn, but then at the end of any one a hint is thrown out of
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.660]   the one that's to come, and then that's taken up in its fullness and worked out, and
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.620]   then a hint of the following one, and then that's taken up in the new section. Well,
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.060]   that's precisely what this Apostle does, so that there is a connection between each
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.900]   of the parts, and yet they are distinct parts in this whole which the Apostle is working
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.260]   out very well. Now the first thing we have to do, therefore,
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:46.540]   as we approach this new section, is to give a kind of general analysis of it. And I suggest
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:54.300]   that the analysis is something like this. In verse 28, the Apostle lays down a proposition.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:03.420]   He makes an assertion. That's verse 28. Then in verses 29 and 30, he proves his proposition.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:12.340]   He demonstrates his assertion. Or, if you like, having made a comprehensive statement
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:21.540]   in verse 28, in verses 29 and 30, he elaborates his last statement in 28, that phrase about
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:28.260]   the called according to his purpose. In verses 29 and 30, he tells us more in detail what
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:36.660]   that means. Very well, then, there is our general analysis of this paragraph. And again,
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.460]   you see, the Apostle is doing something that is so characteristic of himself. That again
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:51.500]   is, as we've seen so frequently, his great method. He makes a statement. He throws out
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.580]   an assertion. But he never leaves it at that. He always argues it out. He always gives us
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:05.020]   reasons. That is the peculiar quality, of course, of his mind. And our view of inspiration
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:13.700]   is one which includes these variations in the styles of the different men. And we must
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.900]   always hold on to that. We don't believe in mechanical dictation. We believe in the
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.700]   absolute control of the Spirit over the minds and thinking and style and everything else
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.700]   of the men. The Holy Spirit so controlled them that they were kept from any error. But
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.060]   the Holy Spirit didn't dictate to them. Otherwise there'd be no variation in the style. But
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:41.900]   there is a great variation. And this is particularly characteristic of the style of this Apostle.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.980]   And incidentally, on that point, any translation of the Bible that does away with the variations
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:56.580]   in the styles of the author is a bad translation. And there is one at the present time which
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:03.460]   is very popular. Now let's leave that and go on.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.620]   Let's not forget this. The style is surely something that should interest us and should
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:15.580]   cause us to marvel. You see, God does that everywhere. That's what you get in creation.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:23.940]   You get all these variations, even within the same species and so on. God brings in
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.740]   these wonderful variations and yet he controls all. It's a very wonderful and very thrilling
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.700]   thought to me. Well now then, let's proceed to consider what
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:41.020]   he says in this paragraph. I needn't take any time, need I, in reminding you that we
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.340]   are looking here at one of the most remarkable statements that even this Apostle ever made.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.660]   It's one of the most wonderful and most comforting statements in the whole range of
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.180]   Scripture. Of course, this chapter, as we've been seeing, is full of such things and there
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:05.340]   are more to come. But I think I'm entitled to say that from the standpoint of sheer statement
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:13.220]   of the exalted doctrine, there is really nothing higher than this. Here is the ultimate doctrine.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:19.660]   There's nothing that one can conceive of which is beyond what the Apostle says in this
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:27.100]   small paragraph, in this short subsection. And I think we all ought to feel that there's
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.060]   no greater privilege on earth than being allowed to look together and to examine a statement
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:40.300]   such as this, realizing as we do so that we are not just like students of philosophy or
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:47.500]   art or anything else. We are here as people who are considering doctrine about ourselves.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.740]   That's the marvel and the wonder of it all. These things, even this exalted doctrine,
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:59.940]   is written for our comfort, for our consolation, as well as for our edification.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.900]   Well now, let's proceed to look at it. And I suggest some such division of the matter
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:12.420]   as this. First of all, we must look at the statement itself. Then, having looked at the
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:19.500]   statement itself, we will go on to consider how we know that the statement is true. And
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.100]   that, incidentally, is my subdivision of verse 28 only. That's how I would divide verse
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:31.860]   28. There's a statement in it, and we're also told how we may know that the statement
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:39.380]   is true. Very well, let's start with the statement. Here it is. "We know that all
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:47.420]   things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:53.740]   to his purpose." Now, what have we got to say about the statement?
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.860]   Well, the first thing we have to do is, because he makes us do it, we've got to notice the
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:06.420]   limitation in the statement. There is a limitation in the statement at once. In other words,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.340]   he doesn't say that all things work together for good for everybody. That isn't what
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:19.740]   he says. He limits it. All things work together for good only to the people specified in the
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:27.980]   statement, and not to anybody else. Now, in the original, in the Greek, this comes
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:35.100]   out much more clearly than it does in our translations. He puts it like this. "And
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:42.220]   we know that to the ones loving God, all things work together for good." And you see the
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.820]   importance of putting that at the beginning. It emphasizes that, so that there can be no
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:53.660]   mistake about it at all. It is to the ones loving God that all things work together for
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:01.820]   good. That's what we know. And that brings out, I say, this point, that it is only applicable
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:08.240]   to God's people, to Christian people. Now, here we come up against something which
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.500]   is emphasized everywhere in the Bible from beginning to end. You see, there's only one
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:20.580]   division of the human race. Here it is. We're on one side or the other of this dividing
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.540]   line. It doesn't matter about any other division or distinction. This is something
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:35.500]   which is true only of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose. As
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:41.580]   for the rest, the scripture tells us quite plainly that all things do not work together
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:49.020]   for good to them. They, we are told, are under the wrath of God. The wrath of God is revealed
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:55.020]   from heaven. He's already told us in the 18th verse of this epistle, in the first chapter,
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.980]   the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:06.860]   who hold down the truth in unrighteousness. That is their position. They are under the
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:12.420]   wrath of God. And far from it being true to say that all things are working together for
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:17.940]   their good, we really are entitled to say that all things are working together to the
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:24.660]   exact opposite end. They don't know that, but that is the simple truth. Whatever may
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.900]   be true of them at the moment, however prosperous, however happy they may be, however much the
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.460]   sun may seem to be shining upon them, the terrible fact about them is that they're
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:44.180]   under the wrath of God. And though appearances may bely that, they will ultimately discover
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:51.700]   that that is their position and that is their state. Now this is, of course, all important.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.020]   And never was it more important, perhaps, than at a time like this. That is why, you
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.220]   see, it is only Christian people who've got any consolation in the world as it is
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.540]   at the present time. There's no consolation for anybody else, and they're beginning
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.940]   to see that. Well, here's our opportunity of telling them, therefore, that the only
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:16.820]   way to have a consolation is to believe the gospel, to conform to God's way and manner
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:22.500]   of life and of living. All these promises are only for these people. Now, it's very
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:30.620]   important we should realize that because sometimes people in an inexpensive sort of mood attempt
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.220]   to say something like this in general, that all things work together for good. Isn't
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.420]   it marvellous how everything seems to be conspiring together for our well-being? But that isn't
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.260]   what we're told here. Now, the poets have sometimes put it like that. Take Browning,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:50.780]   for instance. He works out to this point. He puts it like this. He says, "The years
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.380]   at the spring and days at the morn, mornings at seven, the hillsides dew-pearled, the larks
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:05.140]   on the wing, the snails on the thorn, gods in his heaven, all's right with the world."
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:12.140]   You see, that's the sort of thing they wrote in the Victorian era. No wars, no bombs.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:19.660]   There'd been a long peace, the Pax Britannica. No war worth speaking of, in a sense, since
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:26.580]   the Napoleonic Wars, and everything developing and adventuring, the Halcyon days of mid and
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.900]   late Victorianism. And they sang in this way, "All's right with the world." That's
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.220]   the sort of thing the poets say. They don't always say it. The poet has to be in a given
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:43.340]   mood before he writes like this. He was particularly happy. The muse had been stimulated by something,
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:49.060]   and so they make these wonderful assertions. But of course, they're not true. You read
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.260]   the private lives of many of these poets, you'll find it wasn't true in their own
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:58.380]   time, and it's most certainly not true of the world. You can't draw these deductions.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:04.500]   It simply isn't true. Nobody would believe that today. "All's right with the world."
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.740]   Yes, well, you see, he's looking at the dewdrops, and the hillside, and the lark,
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:15.100]   and the snail. And we would say to him today, "Look at the hydrogen bomb. Look at the
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.820]   rockets. Look at the armies messing." He'd still say the same thing? Of course he wouldn't.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:28.460]   Now that shows you, you see, the difference between the false optimism of the world, these
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:35.380]   generalities in which such people delight, and the particular statements of the Scripture.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:41.620]   No, no. All's not right with the world. All's wrong with the world. And that's
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.420]   why the Christian salvation has ever become necessary. That old false optimism, "Thank
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.580]   God that hydrogen or it is gone." I prefer to see people believing nothing, and feeling
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:58.900]   utterly hopeless and bereft, rather than lulling them to sleep with a false kind of optimism
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.540]   that doesn't stand up to the test of reality. It's very good poetry, I agree, but I'm
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.580]   concerned about the sentiment, the meaning, rather than the ability of the poet as such.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:14.220]   Well, now then, there is the limitation, and we must pay careful attention to it. But now
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.980]   let's go on and look at the meaning of the assertion. And this, of course, will immediately
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:28.660]   show us why the limitation is inevitable, that it only applies to these people. Why?
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:35.820]   Well, the meaning is this. All things work together for good. Now what does this mean?
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:41.740]   Well, you'll notice that some of the manuscripts, as the commentators point out very rightly,
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:48.900]   some of the older manuscripts and early manuscripts, they have an additional statement here. They
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:56.100]   put it like this, "We know that God works together all things for good to them that
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:02.780]   love God." In some of those old manuscripts you find that, that it is God who works all
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.420]   things together. Now here, in this authorized translation, based on the particular text
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:13.020]   which they used, we don't have that addition. But of course, it doesn't make the slightest
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:22.100]   difference because we know that it is God who works all things. All things do not work
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:30.820]   in and of themselves. There is no principle in life itself doing this. It is God who is
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:37.820]   doing this. So whether we adopt one ancient text or another, it doesn't make the slightest
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:43.100]   difference because the view taught in the Bible everywhere is this is the view concerning
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:48.940]   the providence of God. It is God who not only has made everything, it is God who sustains
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:55.460]   everything. It is God who controls everything. The universe isn't working automatically.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:02.580]   It is still under the control of God. Through the Lord Jesus Christ, by him, all things
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:09.420]   subsist. They've not only come into being, they still subsist in that way. So that we
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:15.980]   must not say, we cannot say that all things work together automatically. It is God who
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:21.420]   controls everything, in any case. It is quite obvious, isn't it, even if you adopted the
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:29.820]   other view, that all things would not differentiate between those who love God and the other people.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.100]   But what we are told here is that all things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.580]   Whereas if you just look at the universe and it's working as if there were no God, well,
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.020]   you wouldn't be able to detect any difference between the godly and the ungodly. Indeed,
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.780]   sometimes you come to the conclusion that the ungodly are the favorites. They seem to
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:53.420]   be having a better time very often than the godly people themselves. But the fact is that
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:20:00.140]   if the universe were just working automatically, and were not under the control of God, there
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:06.300]   would not be the slightest difference to what happens to the Christian and the non-Christian.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:12.500]   They would all be subject in exactly the same way to the things that happen. Whereas our
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:18.260]   whole statement is that there is this wonderful difference between those who love God and
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:24.820]   those who don't love God. To those who love God, all things work together for good. So
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:32.540]   that the real meaning of the statement is this, that God is overruling all things in
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:39.860]   such a way that they turn out for the good and the benefit of his people.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:45.820]   Now there's the fundamental assertion. But now we must analyze that and see exactly what
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.860]   it means, because it is, I say, one of the most glorious things we can ever know about
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:57.060]   ourselves. Now my friend, do you realize that about yourself at this moment? Did you know
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:02.740]   that as a Christian, that all things are working together for good for you? Did you know that
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:08.820]   God is overruling everything in the whole cosmos for your good? Did you know it? Well,
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.220]   if you did, you're not depressed, are you? And you haven't been depressed all day, because
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.900]   you can't believe a thing like this and be depressed at the same time. They're mutually
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.100]   exclusive. Now then, here you see is the practical aspect
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.700]   of this great and glorious teaching. Let's work it out. Let's see exactly what it does
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:33.900]   tell us. It says, "All things." What does that mean? Well, there are some of the commentators
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:43.660]   who say that all things mean trials and tribulations only. The great John Calvin, for instance,
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:49.900]   said that. In other words, he limits the all things by what has been dealt with in the
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:56.300]   previous verses. All the trials and the troubles and the tribulations with which the apostle
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:01.180]   began to deal in verse 17, and which he's continued to deal with until the end of verse
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:08.100]   27. They say all things is confined to that. We know that whatever may happen to us along
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:15.860]   that line still is being made by God to work for our good. Well now, it seems to me that
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:22.900]   there is no justification at all for limiting it to that. And it does seem to me to detract
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:29.060]   from the glory of the statement that we should put such a limit upon it. The apostle says
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:38.260]   all things, and I think he means all things. He means good things, favorable things, but
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:45.540]   he also means things that seem to be against us, things that seem to be bad for us, things
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:53.140]   that are discouraging, disheartening, dispiriting. I believe he includes all those. In the end,
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:58.460]   of course, it comes to the same thing. But therefore, let us take it in its comprehensive
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:04.940]   and in its fullest aspect. It's interesting to notice, as we have had to notice so often
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:10.820]   in working through this eighth chapter, that the great apostle is here really, in a sense,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:17.980]   taking up what he's already said in chapter 5, in verses 3 to 5. There, you remember,
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.380]   he puts it like this. "Having said that we rejoice in hope of the glory of God," he goes
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:29.180]   on, "and not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:34.020]   and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:40.620]   of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.460]   Never forget that fifth chapter. As I said at the time, that is in many ways the key
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:51.620]   to this epistle. All his major themes are there, and he takes them up one by one, and
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:57.020]   he's working them out. And that's what he's working out here. In other words, then,
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:06.820]   we say this, that everything is working together for our good. Good things, trials, troubles,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:17.940]   tribulations, illnesses, accidents, disappointments, even failure, yes, even sin. God can make
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:23.380]   all, and does make all, work ultimately for our good.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:30.660]   Now, this is surely a very staggering statement, but it is the statement that is made by the
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:36.180]   apostle. Very well, that means that we've got to consider together the explanation of
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:48.740]   this statement. How are all things made to work together for our good? Now, here again,
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:57.460]   it is quite clear, surely, how this statement must be limited only to Christian people,
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:04.180]   and has got nothing to do with people who are not Christian. It is only in the case
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:11.180]   of Christians that we can demonstrate how exactly this happens, how all things are made
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:19.900]   to work together for our good. Because trials and tribulations and failure and sin are not
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:25.380]   good in and of themselves. It's folly to pretend that they're good. They're not
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:30.220]   good in and of themselves. They're bad. Well, how does he make the statement, then,
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.300]   that they all work together for good? Ah, that is the whole marvel of this Christian
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:45.500]   position. They are so used by God and overruled by God, and implied by God, that they turn
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:51.340]   out to our good. Now, there's the essential point that we've got to grasp here. The
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:56.340]   things are not good in and of themselves. Now, many people have fallen into that trap.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:03.820]   You read the lives of some of the saints, the Tinnerites, some of the so-called saints,
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:10.460]   and you will find that many of them fell into error at this point. They believed that there
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:18.700]   was some inherent good in suffering. So when they were not suffering, they courted suffering,
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:24.620]   and they deliberately brought suffering upon themselves. All tendencies to mutilate the
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:33.820]   body and, as it were, to scarify the flesh are the result of that particular error. They
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:39.900]   almost got into the position that they believed that there was something inherently good in
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:45.700]   suffering in that way. And obviously, this is the whole theory that leads to a kind of
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:53.460]   masochism. And many of the saints have been guilty of that very thing. It's a perverted
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:58.820]   notion. It's quite unlike the teaching which we've got here, or anywhere else in the
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:04.460]   whole of Scripture. So the statement is not that these things are good in and of themselves.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.860]   If they were good in and of themselves, they'd do as much good to the non-Christian as they
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:13.180]   do to the Christian. But they don't. No, no. It is what God does with them that turns
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:19.580]   them into our good. Now then, what happens? Well, it surely works like this. There's
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:24.020]   no need to spend any time in showing how the good things work for our good. That's obvious.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:30.940]   The problem is, how do we show that things that seem to be against us work to our good?
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:39.020]   How can I argue that trials, tribulations, persecutions, or sickness, physical weakness,
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.140]   all these things that trouble us and get us down so much, how can we demonstrate that
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:48.700]   these things work together for good to us who are Christian? Well, they do it in some
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:56.900]   such way as this. They start by just pulling us up. And that's a very good thing for
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:03.380]   us all of us. The most dangerous thing for all of us is that everything should be just
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.020]   going well, without much change and without much incident. That's always a dangerous
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:14.740]   condition to be in. Now that's just human nature, isn't it? It's something that could
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:22.980]   be illustrated endlessly in the natural realm in life. Many a man has found that in his
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.860]   business, in the days when he was struggling and having problems and difficulties, well,
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.100]   he was paying much attention to everything and everything went well. When he gets over
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.940]   this and he gets into this second stage, everything seems to be running smoothly and automatically.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.420]   That's a very dangerous stage in that man's business. He can become slack and negligent
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.140]   and things can begin to go wrong and he won't see them. He won't know that they're happening
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:50.180]   because he's not showing the same keenness as he was before. Well, now it's exactly the
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:58.180]   same in the Christian life, in the spiritual life. When everything is just coming and going,
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:04.620]   the wheel is just turning round, or as the phrase goes, about the engine of the car just
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:10.200]   taking over, it's a very dangerous state for the soul very often. That's just the time
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:16.300]   when our enemy, our adversary comes in. So when anything goes wrong, there's a trial
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:23.780]   or a tribulation, it has the effect of pulling us out. It breaks the routine. It startles
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:30.020]   us. It awakens us. Now I say that's always good for us because it makes us think. And
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.580]   anything that makes us think is always very good for us. The worst state to be in is a
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.940]   state in which a man doesn't think. Just takes things for granted, just goes on with
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:43.620]   his routine. It's a wonderful thing to have your routine upset. And it doesn't matter
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:49.260]   very much from this standpoint what it is that upsets it. It's always good, I say,
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.620]   to do that. And of course, if things don't do this for you, that's where discipline
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.860]   comes in. That's where self-examination is important. That's where setting certain times
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:04.060]   for this may have some kind of justification. And that's why these things have come into
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.020]   the practice and the habit of the Christian Church throughout the centuries. Very well.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:14.100]   There's the first effect. We are shocked, we are awakened, we are made to think. And
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:21.580]   already we are in a better state than we were before. Very well. We are now going to pay
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.660]   attention to the problem. It's like a man, you see, whose health had been running down.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:33.460]   And he wasn't very well aware of it. Just went on, perhaps not feeling as well as he
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.020]   was, but he could shake it off. It wasn't anything very real. Suddenly he gets a severe
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.060]   pain. Well, now he's got to pay attention to it. He's got to send for his doctor. And
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.940]   the doctor discovers that this thing has been growing and developing in the man for quite
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.980]   a long time, and says, "Why didn't you come to me before?" But the man didn't go until
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.300]   the pain made him go. Well, now that's the kind of thing that tribulations and trials
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:59.400]   do to us. They pull us up. They make us pay attention to the thing. And now we are beginning
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:06.780]   to face the position as it is. And what do we find? Well, what we find is this. These
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:13.300]   troubles and problems and trials that come in various ways, they reveal at once to us
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:24.260]   our own smallness, and our own weakness, and our own frailty. And we don't always realize
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:31.100]   that. The devil tries to develop in us a kind of self-confidence. We started by knowing
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:35.120]   that we'd been saved by grace, but we begin to think that we are running this Christian
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.820]   life ourselves. And we develop a kind of confidence. Suddenly, we find ourselves knocked down,
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:47.980]   as it were, and we are reminded again of our smallness, our frailty, and our weakness.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:53.820]   And still more, our lack of understanding. You see, we'd been going on, and we'd been
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.860]   reading a lot of theology and other books, and we really thought we knew all about it.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.820]   We were complete authorities in all God's ways, and nothing could ever upset us. We
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:09.580]   really now did understand everything. Suddenly, we are stricken in some way, and we find ourselves
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:17.420]   as helpless as babes. We just don't understand. We see our smallness in particular in this
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:22.780]   matter of understanding. We see that the whole thing is so much bigger than we thought. We
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:27.920]   thought we'd reduced it to our system, but we haven't, or to our knowledge, but we haven't.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:34.460]   And here I say immediately, we are caused to see our lack of understanding and of knowledge.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:42.220]   And then in turn that leads us to see our own sinfulness, and our readiness to have
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:48.900]   wrong ideas of God. We've got so much of this described in the Bible, haven't we? We get
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:55.460]   it in the biographies, we've known it ourselves. When things go wrong, we tend to complain
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.340]   and to grumble, to wonder why God has allowed this to happen to us, why should it happen
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.660]   to me, and so on, and contrast ourselves with other people, the godless, who are having
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:12.140]   such a wonderful time, and so on. Here we are awakened to our own utter sinfulness,
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:18.180]   and our readiness and promise to harbor such unworthy thoughts and ideas concerning God
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.520]   who has loved us with an everlasting love. Well, these things, they just knock us down,
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:31.140]   and they bring us to that realization about ourselves. In other words, they humble us.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:36.900]   They humble us. And there's nothing better for us than that we should be humbled, every
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:44.100]   one of us. We are in a dangerous state when we are not humble, and we must be humble in
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:50.220]   every respect. If we are not humble in every respect, we are in great danger. And we mustn't
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:56.500]   be surprised if we find ourselves being humbled. Now this great apostle, you remember, puts
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:04.100]   that to us so clearly in the classical passage on this whole matter, in 2 Corinthians 12.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:09.860]   He tells us exactly why this sort of thing happened to him. "Lest I should be exalted
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:15.260]   above measure, through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:23.380]   in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:31.940]   2 Corinthians 12, verse 7. Now there it is. He recognizes it in himself. Because of the
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:37.660]   amazing experience he'd had, the tendency to be puffed up, and he had to be brought
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:44.620]   down. "Lest I be exalted above measure." Now, you see, we are following the process
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:50.580]   of these things that seem to be hard and against us and unpleasant for our good. They knock
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.300]   us down, they humble us, and it's a good place to be. "He that is down need fear no
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:03.380]   fall, he that is low no pride." Humility is ever the greatest safeguard in this spiritual
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:08.180]   life. So when we are brought down and brought low and humble, it's a very good thing for
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:14.580]   us. And anything that does that for us is working for our good.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.460]   And there in this condition we begin to see a whole host of things that we'd been tending
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:25.020]   to forget. We see our need of forgiveness. You know, I've known Christian people who've
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.940]   said quite sincerely that they really didn't think that there was any need for them as
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:34.460]   Christians to ask to be forgiven. What a terrible state to be in. Well, when you're knocked
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.580]   down like this, and when you really allow it to work its way through, you'll soon see
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.940]   the need of forgiveness. Were it merely for your wrong thoughts about God, your unworthy
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.020]   thoughts, your tendency to grumble and to complain, it's a horrible sin. It's a terrible
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:55.760]   sin. Much worse than sins of the flesh, because it's an evil, unworthy thought about the God
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:03.020]   of love who has done so much for us. We see our need of forgiveness. We see our need of
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:13.940]   strength. We see our need of help. And thus, in our utter helplessness, we are driven back
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:23.020]   to God. Now then, anything that drives us back to God is good for us. That's how it
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:29.100]   works out. It drives, these things drive us back to God, because we didn't know what
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.300]   to do. We've already admitted it in prayer. We know not what to pray for as we ought,
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.920]   but that makes us pray all the more. We cry out with ease groanings, and that's a good
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:47.740]   state to be in, because it's driven us back to an utter, entire dependence upon God.
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.940]   And of course, once we do that, we now begin to discover things about God that we never
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:58.460]   knew before. This is how we get to grow in knowledge, in grace, and in the knowledge
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:03.620]   of God. Or if we did know something before, we get to know them with a new depth, with
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:09.780]   a new meaning, with a new understanding. It has been the universal testimony of the saints
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:15.420]   of the centuries that it is through this kind of experience they've really got to know
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:24.100]   God. The child, the babe in Christ, he knows very little about God. He knows he's forgiven.
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:29.700]   Oh, but that's the mere beginning. It's the first principles of the gospel of Christ.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:35.380]   There are depths, there are riches that he knows nothing about. And sometimes it's
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.900]   necessary that he should be dealt with in this way in order to bring him to that knowledge.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:45.980]   What knowledge? Well, I'm thinking of things like this. It is only in that sort of condition
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:54.180]   we really get to know the love and the grace of God. His kindness, his compassion, his
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:04.020]   tenderness, his patience, his long-suffering. How little we know of that. But you know,
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.740]   these are some of the great characteristics, the attributes of God. How much do we know
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:15.860]   about God's patience, God's solicitude, God's tenderness, God's care for us? It's
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:21.220]   only in this sort of condition that we begin really to learn about that, and his readiness
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:27.780]   to forgive, his readiness to restore, his readiness to help and to lead.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:32.940]   Ah, we can read the parable of the prodigal son and accept it theoretically. Have you
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:38.420]   known God dealing with you like that? What a wonderful revelation it is of the character
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:43.180]   of God and of his heart of love. It's only when you've been through this kind of experience
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.980]   you get to know that. You knew it theoretically, but now you know it in a much deeper way when
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.780]   you've actually passed through the experience yourself.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:58.700]   In other words, let me sum it up like this. Our greatest trouble is our ignorance of God.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.980]   We don't know God as we ought. We know things about God. But our real trouble, every one
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:14.860]   of us, is our ignorance of God himself, what he really is, and what he is to his people.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:20.220]   And the way he brings us to that knowledge, and the way in which he reveals himself to
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:28.780]   us in this way, is by using these various things that happen to us in order to bring
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:36.420]   us to the knowledge. These are the ways he uses to draw us to himself. Now then, this
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:44.820]   is our greatest need, I say. And it is also, at the same time, the best preparation for
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:50.420]   eternity and for dwelling everlastingly in the presence of God.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:56.500]   Now there is the first answer to the question, how do all things work together for our good?
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:04.860]   They do it by bringing us back to God and to a fresh revelation of what he really is
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:10.740]   in his dealings with his people. Now it's a tragedy that this should be necessary, but
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:18.420]   that's what sin has done to us. That is what sin has done to man. He can't take the truth
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:23.180]   directly and positively. This sort of thing has to happen to us in order to bring us to
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:28.740]   our senses and in order to make us amenable to the knowledge.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:36.340]   But not only that, you see, it works like this. These things happening to us compel
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:44.020]   us to realize the nature of our life in this world. That's half our trouble, isn't it?
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:49.940]   The world is too much with us. We've got our business, our profession, our family,
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:55.180]   our friends, and half our spiritual troubles arise from the fact that we are lost in these
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.540]   things and we tend to live for them. It's very difficult not to. We are in the flesh
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:05.140]   still and here are these things drawing us from all directions. These are the things
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:11.220]   that stand between us and the knowledge of God and the knowledge of eternity.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:18.180]   But you see, when these things happen to you, they teach you that you've got to be detached.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.660]   Very difficult to detach yourself from this life and this world when you're well and
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:26.540]   healthy and strong. But when you're lying on a sick bed, it isn't quite so difficult,
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:31.980]   is it? You're bound to think about it. And how slow we are to think about these things.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.540]   You're reminded that you're only here for a while, and that's a very good thing for
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:43.140]   us. Because it makes us become a little loose in our attachment to the world. It shakes
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:48.740]   us, shakes us out of it, and reminds us that we are nothing but pilgrims and strangers.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:54.620]   Or to put it positively. These things make us think more of the glory
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:42:01.140]   to which we are going. Now why do we think so little about that glory? Here it is described
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:07.100]   to us in the Scriptures. This amazing glory that's coming, which the apostle has been
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:12.700]   describing in detail to us. The whole creation is waiting for this manifestation of the sons
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:18.180]   of God. That's you and myself. We are the sons of God. Now this glory is indescribable
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:24.780]   as we've seen. Well why do we think so little about it? Why do we meditate so little concerning
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:29.220]   it? The answer is, we are too preoccupied with this life, with this world, with the
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:34.860]   things that are seen, the things that are around and about us. And when we are suddenly
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:40.460]   deprived of these things or are shown our loose attachment to them, we begin to remind
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.820]   ourselves that we are after all pilgrims of eternity. That death is not the end, that
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:51.180]   there is a glory awaiting us. And we begin to think of that glory. And anything that
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.540]   makes you think of that is a very good thing for you. I don't care what it is. It may
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.620]   be an illness, it may be an accident, it may be a disappointment. I don't care what it
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.980]   is my friend. You may have come in here very disappointed tonight. Something's gone wrong
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:09.100]   perhaps in your personal life, in your emotional life. I don't care what it is. And you are
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:15.500]   struck down. You shouldn't be as a Christian. You should be made to think by this that you
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:21.380]   really are destined for that indescribable glory that's coming. And you're made to think
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.580]   more of that. That's a very good thing for you. The thing that seemed hard and troublesome
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:31.340]   and almost cruel is being used for your good. It makes you think of this. And it's thus
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:36.340]   you see. To use the phrase that the apostle is going to use later on in this very chapter
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:42.540]   in verse 37. It is in this way that we are more than conquerors through him that loved
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:48.980]   us. And now as Christians we are meant to be more than conquerors. It's the same thing
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:57.620]   exactly as saying that all these things work together for our good. Now as we close tonight,
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:04.780]   let me put it like this in an illustration that I once heard was used by an old preacher
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:11.700]   about a hundred years ago. I think it was a good illustration. It helped people at the
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.940]   time. It seems to me to be a good one. He said, "Now here's a statement which appears
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:21.940]   to be contradictory. All things work together for good to them that love God." Well how
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.460]   can that be? The good things I can see, they're working in this direction. But look at those
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:31.220]   other things. They seem to be working in the opposite direction. How can you say that things
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:36.900]   which are working in opposite directions are for my good? Well the illustration that was
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:41.540]   used by the old preacher was an illustration of a watch. He said, "Take your watch and
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:47.700]   open it. And what do you see?" Well you see that one wheel is turning this way. It's
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.380]   turning in an anti-clockwise direction. But there it's attached to another wheel that's
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:57.620]   working the opposite way in a clockwise direction. And you open your watch and you look at this
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:02.420]   machinery and you say, "This is mad. This is quite ridiculous. Here are wheels working
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.580]   in opposite directions." The man who made that watch must have been a madman. But the
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:11.580]   answer is, of course, he wasn't. That's how he's arranged that this watch is going
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:17.820]   to work and the hands are going to move around. Because all these different wheels are ultimately
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:23.980]   controlled by a mainspring. There's a purpose at the back of it all. And at the back of
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:29.300]   the mainspring is the man, the watchmaker, who made the watch. It can be wound up. And
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:34.660]   this spring now is going to control everything. One turning this way, one turning that way.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:39.660]   But they're all working together to move the pins around. And so you know the time
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:44.940]   and all these things that appear to be in contradiction are working together to the
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:53.020]   same end. He said it's like that. You look at life and you say at first, "What's
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.060]   wrong with me? I can see that certain things are good for him, but look at these other
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:03.260]   things. These are all against me." Think again, he said. Think again. Think of the
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:09.660]   one who's planned it all. Don't jump to conclusions. Look for an ultimate purpose.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:15.340]   Look for an ultimate end. And if you do so with a spiritual eye, as you should, you will
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:21.180]   soon begin to see that God knows what he's doing. We shall see this, of course, in the
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:27.420]   great doctrine to which we are coming. It's his purpose. Yes, look at it again with spiritual
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:33.060]   eyes and you'll come to the conclusion that all things, everything, every part and portion
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:38.060]   of it, everything that's happening to you is working together. God's made it like
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:46.740]   that. It's wound it up. He keeps it going. All is working together for our good, our
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:54.020]   immediate good, but still more, our ultimate, our final good. Well, God willing, we'll
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:57.940]   go on in working out the details of this glorious statement.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:07.140]   O Lord, our God, we come to thee again to offer up our praise. Lord, we thank thee that
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.020]   our salvation is altogether and entirely of thee. We see more and more that if any part
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:17.700]   of it were of us, it would fail. For we see that we cannot think properly even in the
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:23.340]   Christian life. We see we're ever subject to the insinuations of the devil, ever ready
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:30.260]   to think harsh, unworthy thoughts of thee. O God, we thank thee that we're in thy hands
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:35.580]   and that thy thoughts are not our thoughts, nor are thy ways our ways. We thank thee,
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:40.540]   O Lord, that there's an eternal difference between them. As high as the heavens are above
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:46.900]   the earth so are thy thoughts and our thoughts, and thy ways and our ways. Lord, we thank
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:53.420]   thee that it is so, and that our safety and our security lie in this fact, and that our
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:59.980]   joy and our happiness lie in the same fact. Therefore, O God, we worship thee and adore
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:07.700]   thee. We praise thy name. O grant that we all may know this blessed assurance that we
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:13.580]   are in thy hands, that we are thy people, and that therefore all things are working
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:24.340]   together even now for our good, temporal and eternal. And now, may the grace of our Lord
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:30.060]   and Saviour Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:36.140]   Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:45.820]   hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we arrive ultimately in that glory,
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:51.580]   perfect and entire and complete. Amen.
