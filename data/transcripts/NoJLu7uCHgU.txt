[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   All right, we got a question here from Carolina.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.040]   Carolina wants to know about Netflix.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.360]   She says, "What is a good way to smartly use streaming platforms such as Netflix?
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.160]   I really enjoy watching movies and series, but I feel that I'm not always in control.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.520]   I can get trapped in them, and instead of watching just one episode of a series, I end
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.840]   up watching three or four.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.360]   What would you suggest is the best way to use these platforms wisely?
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.000]   Keep in mind that this is a pleasurable activity for me."
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.840]   I'm not super worried about it, first of all, Carolina.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.720]   So if what we're talking about is it's the evening, like you've done your work and you
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.480]   time blocked and you had your shutdown, and you plan to watch one episode and then do
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.080]   something else and go to bed, and you watch three episodes instead.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.560]   I mean, it's not the worst thing.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.360]   All right, so let me just first say that.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.920]   Now, if you're doing this like in the middle of the day, "Oh, I wanted to watch an episode
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.040]   during my 30-minute lunch break, and I end up taking two hours off."
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.520]   Okay, that's a problem.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.520]   Solution is simple.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   Don't touch stream platforms during the workday.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.960]   But if we're talking about in the evening, you're watching some interesting show on Netflix
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.760]   and you watch for an hour instead of 20 minutes, I mean, I'm not super worried about that.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.160]   I'm not super worried about that.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.440]   A few things I can suggest, one is multiple people told me during the research for my
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.520]   book, Digital Minimalism, multiple people told me that they had success with a don't
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.480]   watch Netflix alone rule.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.240]   These are younger people, typically people who had roommates, et cetera.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.840]   And they didn't want to get lost, like spend all of their free time on streaming platforms.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.320]   They had a rule that says you can watch it as long as someone else is there.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.120]   So you can still get the social benefit out of the platform.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.040]   I want to sit and watch a series with my friends, and it's social and that's fun, but get rid
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.000]   of the mindless distraction potential of the platform where you just sort of watch it on
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.440]   your own for a long amount of time.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440]   So that might help.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.280]   Two, I think you should just structure better your other high-quality leisure activities.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.760]   So if you have more structure and clarity around the other stuff you want to do with
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.520]   your free time, you know, I'm trying to do like Cal's five books a month challenge.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.100]   Getting into making, and I've joined an online community where I'm trying to build something
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.160]   and I meet once a week with people or I'm into fitness.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.000]   And now I have a trail running group that we meet once a week and I need to train for
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   it.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.720]   If you have like structured, focused, engaging, hopefully somewhat social high-quality leisure,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.960]   then that will just take up good time.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.680]   And it will take that time away from just getting lost on Netflix.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.360]   You know, I mean, this is the other issue when some people complain, they spend too
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.000]   much time staring at these streaming services.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.080]   It's because they're filling a void.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.900]   They don't know what to do.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.900]   Work is over.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.900]   It's not time to go to bed.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.900]   I'm a little anxious.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.900]   I'm a little sad.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.900]   I don't know what to do.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.960]   Let me just get lost in this.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.680]   And the right answer, if you're in that situation, is not just white knuckle it and stare at
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680]   the wall.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.140]   It's find something even better than Netflix to do.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.840]   So when it comes time to watch Netflix, like, Hey, look, I was just out on the trail all
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840]   day.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   I just finished building this thing.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.880]   I just finished my fourth book.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   Now I'm going to watch some Netflix.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.040]   And okay, maybe I watched two instead of one or three instead of two.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.600]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.960]   So you can make your leisure clearer and more structured and higher quality.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.800]   Then you leave less oxygen in the room for the streaming services.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.560]   So I will give you all that advice.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.200]   But again, my foundation here is I'm not, I'm not super worried about you watching it
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.600]   a little bit more than you want.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.960]   I'm worried if it's what you're spending all your time doing.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.840]   I'm worried if it's getting in the way of work.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.800]   And so that other, those other pieces of advice should help in that situation.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.600]   [MUSIC]
