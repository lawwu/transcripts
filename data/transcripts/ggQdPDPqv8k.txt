[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   [silence]
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.900]   Now, a topic that is sure to be a bit controversial,
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.620]   but it really shouldn't be because the data,
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.320]   at least to me, are very clear,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.300]   is this issue of phone use and sperm quality.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.140]   Now, this can open up a whole array of issues
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.900]   related to things like EMFs,
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.860]   and you've got people out there that have, you know,
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.660]   ideas about 5G and all of this stuff.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.500]   That is not what this discussion is about.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.580]   The discussion I'm about to have with you
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.500]   relates to the fact that the electromagnetic fields
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.460]   and the heat-related effects of smartphones
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.940]   can indeed have a detrimental effect on sperm quality,
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.000]   and yes, indeed, on testosterone levels as well.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.660]   I'm going to refer you to a paper.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180]   We will link it in the show note captions.
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.380]   The title of this paper is
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.500]   "Effects of Mobile Phone Usage on Sperm Quality.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.080]   No Time-Dependent Relationship on Usage.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.500]   A Systematic Review and Updated Meta-Analysis."
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.660]   This is a paper that came out in 2021,
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.340]   and talks about the fact
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.380]   that phones emit a radio frequency electromagnetic waves,
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.740]   which are called RF radio frequency,
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.980]   EMWs, electromagnetic waves,
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.060]   at a low level between 80 and 2,200 megahertz
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.660]   that can be absorbed by the human body.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.900]   We know this, okay, this is not controversial,
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020]   and have potential adverse effects on brain, heart,
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.580]   endocrine system, and reproductive function.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.540]   That has been established.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.620]   Keep in mind, there is basically no controversy
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.900]   that radio frequency waves and EMFs
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.060]   can have a negative impact on biological tissues.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.540]   The question is how intense
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.220]   are those radio frequency waves and EMFs,
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.300]   and how detrimental are those on those biological tissues?
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.140]   Okay, it's a matter of degrees,
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.740]   but there is very little controversy
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.120]   as to whether or not they have an effect
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.140]   on biological tissues,
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.420]   and I'm aware of absolutely zero data
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.820]   showing that they can have a positive effect
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.260]   on biological tissues.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.880]   Since what we're mainly talking about now are smartphones,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.300]   we want to separate out the heat effects of smartphones
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.100]   from the EMFs related to the fact
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.140]   that they are Wi-Fi smartphones,
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.900]   or they're using cellar towers and Wi-Fi.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.380]   One or the other combination.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.900]   Okay, so there are a number of different things
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.560]   in the phone that could be detrimental.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.540]   We need to separate those out.
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.360]   Why?
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.700]   Well, because you might have heard
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.100]   that carrying your phone in your pocket
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.940]   can reduce your testosterone levels and sperm count,
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.980]   and guess what?
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.460]   That is true.
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.620]   The data contained within this meta-analysis
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.040]   and other meta-analyses clearly point out
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.420]   that it can reduce sperm count
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.500]   and maybe testosterone levels significantly,
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.520]   but certainly sperm count and motility significantly.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.280]   It reduces sperm quality.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.980]   So should you avoid putting your phone in your pocket?
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.540]   Certainly your front pocket, I would suggest yes, right?
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.220]   If you are somebody who is seeking to conceive, right?
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.900]   I'm not somebody who is going to stop using my smartphone.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.860]   I don't expect anyone's going to stop using their smartphone.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.780]   The question is, should you carry it in your front pocket
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.960]   if you're a male?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.500]   I think to be on the safe side,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.340]   the answer is probably avoid doing that too much of the time.
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.320]   Ideally, don't do it at all.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.460]   Then people will say, well, what if I turn off the Wi-Fi
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.040]   or I turn off the cellular access,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.340]   then is it still a problem?
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.340]   Well, it's a problem due to the heat-related effects.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.660]   And then people say, well,
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.980]   I don't actually feel the heat of the phone.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.560]   It doesn't get that warm.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.180]   But the temperature effects of the phone, it turns out,
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.340]   are enough, even under conditions
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.380]   in which people don't report it to be uncomfortably warm,
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.940]   that it can change the temperature milieu of the testicle
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.500]   in ways that can diminish sperm quality.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.200]   How much and how that relates to fertility
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.680]   and healthy pregnancy, not clear.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.160]   But since we're talking about things to avoid,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.740]   if your goal is to have a healthy fertilization
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.640]   in pregnancy, well then, by all means,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.200]   just don't carry it in your front pocket.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.640]   Then people say, well, what about back pocket
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.680]   or what about backpack?
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.120]   Look, it's very clear that avoiding being too close
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.440]   to the phone is probably better for your sperm quality
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.620]   than putting the phone very close to your testicles
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.440]   or anywhere else on your body.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.340]   But it's also the reality that most people
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.700]   are going to carry a phone nowadays, all right?
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.580]   It's just the reality.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.460]   I think the current estimates,
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.420]   and it's discussed in this paper,
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.460]   that 90% of the human population has a smartphone.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.900]   90%, which is incredible.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.800]   The adult population, of course.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.580]   Although a lot of kids have them as well.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.380]   So this paper goes on to detail a number
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.380]   of different studies and outcomes from studies.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.460]   But basically what they find, and here I'm paraphrasing,
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.220]   is that the data indicate that sperm quality declines
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.860]   when people start using a mobile phone.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.600]   So from the point they start using a mobile phone,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.740]   regardless of the usage time, this is important.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.520]   It used to be thought that it was four hours a day
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.220]   or more of holding your phone or having that phone
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.380]   close to your body was going to diminish sperm quality.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.380]   It turns out that it's not related to usage time.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.940]   That's even the title of the paper.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.100]   It's just the fact that people are using mobile phones
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.140]   is reducing sperm count and quality.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.000]   That's the reality.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.020]   Is it entirely responsible for all the reductions
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.820]   in sperm quality and maybe even the reductions
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.580]   in testosterone levels that we're observing
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.860]   from decade to decade going forward?
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.060]   I doubt that's the case.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.600]   Is it likely to be one of the major players?
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.980]   I've got my bet on the fact that it is based
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.420]   on the data that I've observed.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.540]   And so if any of you would like to peruse the data
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.380]   in this meta-analysis, they're quite good.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.860]   This study looked at 18 studies that include 4,280 samples.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.420]   They were able to separate out the radio frequency
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.500]   versus the heat effects, and they were able
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.020]   to eliminate this time of usage variable
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.020]   that previously we thought if you were exposed
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.860]   to a lot of cell phone contact, that it was far worse
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.940]   than if you were exposed to a little bit.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.620]   Turns out if you're exposed to any at all,
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.020]   you're going to diminish sperm quality.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.960]   What does that mean?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.340]   Does that mean that no matter what you do,
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.720]   if you own a smartphone,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.460]   that you're going to diminish sperm quality?
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.020]   I think the short answer is yes,
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.960]   but that you can mitigate it.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.820]   What might you do?
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.140]   Well, keeping your phone away from your groin
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.580]   or as far from your groin as possible,
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.200]   if you're a male who's wishing to conceive
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.500]   and maybe even a male who's wishing
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.580]   to maximize his testosterone levels,
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.300]   because it does appear that radio frequency waves
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.680]   and the heat from the phone,
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.460]   so both of those factors independently and together,
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.340]   of course, can disrupt the lydic cells of the testes
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.900]   and the production of testosterone
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.100]   and intratesticular testosterone.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.900]   It's important for sperm production.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.980]   The exact biological variables leading
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.180]   to all these changes isn't exactly clear,
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.740]   but if you're like me, you say, okay,
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.220]   probably not a problem for most males to carry their phone,
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.060]   but probably best to not carry it in the front pocket,
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.300]   maybe even avoid carrying the back pocket as well.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.980]   Again, in the future, we will have an episode
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.220]   all about Bluetooth.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.140]   We'll talk about various aspects of EMFs.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.400]   It's a super interesting data set,
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.540]   and it's a data set for which there's a ton of controversy.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.700]   It's really interesting, however,
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.060]   and there are more and more quality data
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.140]   coming out all the time.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.060]   And I think going forward, we are going to see
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.740]   that indeed there are some negative effects
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.860]   of smartphones related
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.800]   to both the radio frequency transmission
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.020]   and the fact that they generate heat.
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.220]   And in general, heat is not good for biological tissues.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.880]   (upbeat music)
