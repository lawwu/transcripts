[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Romans 1 verses 18 to 32 is striking. There, the Apostle Paul casts the fallout of idolatry
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.940]   into categories of sexual sin, of a deepening entrapment to sexual sin, and specifically
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.320]   homosexual practices. The immediate relevance and potency of this text for our own culture
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.520]   raises all sorts of controversy, and merely expounding the Bible's own words in this
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.040]   chapter is an act commonly judged to be scandalous hate speech. But the Bible says it, we won't
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.200]   ignore it, and Christians can't ignore it. So then, can these idolatries be saved from
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.560]   a process of divine heart-hardening? This question arrives from a listener named Nate.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.040]   "Hello Pastor John, I was recently reading Romans chapter 1 verses 18 to 32. There, Paul
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.260]   seems to be saying that God gave up homosexual sinners to dishonorable passions because they
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.520]   worship the creature rather than the Creator. There's a judgment in this text of God giving
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.320]   them over to a further hardening, and yet it also seems to me that former practitioners
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.560]   of homosexual sin can be saved out of that lifestyle, as we see in 1 Corinthians chapter
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.200]   6 verses 9 to 11. So the handing over does not seem to be a permanent, irreversible thing
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   either. So is it possible for the ever-hardening heart of Romans 1 to eventually be saved?"
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:34.240]   Well, if Nate uses the phrase "ever-hardening heart," then he's already answering the question.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.360]   Because if they are saved, then the hardening wasn't ever-hardening. But I assume what he's
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:49.760]   asking is whether the people of Romans 1 whom God gave up to the lust of their hearts can
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:02:00.280]   be saved. In other words, is the giving up to hardness, to lusts, always forever? God
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.200]   can give up to hardness and corruption for a season or not, can He? And my answer is
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.680]   yes. He can and He does, and so the people of Romans 1 can be saved if God sends them
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.520]   the gospel and opens their hearts to believe it. And here are several reasons that I think
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.880]   that. And the main one is the flow of thought in Romans 1 through 3 itself. We don't have
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.920]   to run over to 1 Corinthians 6, which we will, but we don't have to. The main point is that
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.040]   the flow of thought, Paul's intention in Romans 1 through 3, is to teach just thatâ€”namely,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.920]   that these folks in Romans 1 can be saved. Chapter 1 describes the typical Gentile situation
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.480]   before God in the bondage of blindness and sin. Chapter 2 describes the Jewish situation
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.820]   of bondage and blindness to sin. Then chapter 3 introduces God's saving action to rescue
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.200]   people from both groups, Jew and Gentile. So verse 9 of chapter 3 summarizes what he's
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.880]   been saying for two chapters, and he says, "What then? Are we Jews any better off? No,
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.160]   not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks," chapter 1 and
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.820]   chapter 2, "are under sin." And I think that phrase "under sin" refers to bondage, under
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:43.240]   the power of sin for both Jew and Gentile, as they were described in chapters 1 and chapter
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:53.080]   2. And then comes this glorious saving action in chapter 3, 21, "But now the righteousness
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.280]   of God has been manifested apart from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:05.940]   to it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For,"
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.880]   and these important words, "there's no distinction for all who have sinned and fall short of
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.520]   the glory of God. They are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.720]   is in Christ Jesus." Those words, "all have sinned and fall short," or literally lack
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.320]   the glory of God, are, I think, intentionally designed to recall verse 23 of chapter 1,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.940]   they exchange the glory of God for images and resembling mortal man and birds and animals
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.200]   and creeping things. Those are the people that God gives up to dishonorable passions,
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.040]   because they exchange the glory of God. They lack the glory of God. These are the very
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.680]   ones who threw away God's glory and he handed them over to corruption. These are the ones
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:07.560]   in 323 who are justified by faith. That's the connection Paul is making. So that's my
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:15.240]   first reason for saying that the condition of the Gentiles in chapter 1 of being handed
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:23.700]   over to the lusts of their flesh is not necessarily irrevocable. I think chapter 3 of Romans is
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.920]   intended to say that God saves all who believe, including some of them from chapter 1. Here's
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:39.280]   the second reason I think we should be hopeful for folks in chapter 1 of Romans. That same
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.320]   flow of thought is found in 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10. It says, "Do you not know that
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.440]   the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?" So there they are, set, trajectory
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.560]   is on, they are doomed. "Do not be deceived, neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.480]   nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.560]   revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God." That corresponds to the Gentile
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.640]   situation of Romans 1. In verse 11, "Such were some of you, you believers, you saints,
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.680]   you people on the way to heaven, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God." And that corresponds to the salvation
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:44.200]   in Romans 3 through 8. So we're encouraged to believe that God steps in to the seeming
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:51.600]   impossible bondage to sin that he himself has handed people over to and sovereignly
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.000]   changes their hearts and saves them. And here's the third reason I think the sinners in Romans
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.360]   1 that God has given up to bondage to sin can be saved and should take heart. God is
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:18.200]   free to save anyone he please, and none can thwart his purpose to do so. Romans 9.15,
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:25.320]   God says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:32.480]   on whom I will have compassion." So then it depends not on human will or exertion,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   or you could add, or any bondage that they're in, but on God who has mercy. So he has mercy
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:46.040]   on whom he wills, and he hardens whom he wills. In other words, if God has given people over
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.760]   to the hardness of their heart, he is free to step in at any time he please, with anyone
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.480]   he please, to free them from that hardness. Here's a fourth reason we should be hopeful
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:11.880]   for those who seem to be impossibly ensnared in sin. He raises the spiritually dead. Ephesians
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:21.040]   2.5. He gives new birth. John 3.8. He takes out the heart of stone and puts in the heart
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:31.000]   of flesh, Ezekiel 11.19. So we should be encouraged that God can take out any hard heart that
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   he has handed people over to. In other words, salvation isn't a mingling of human resolve
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.760]   and God's resolve. It is a powerful, sovereign work of God replacing hearts. Finally, we
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:55.920]   should take heart for those folks in Romans 1, because even though Satan is stronger than
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:04.040]   we are, nevertheless, God overcomes satanic blindness to save people, according to 2 Corinthians
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:13.600]   4, 4-6. So if he's willing and able to step in and conquer Satan's supernatural power
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.560]   of blindness, who loves to beat up on people who have been handed over by God to their
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.200]   sin, we can be encouraged that he is able and willing to save those who are in bondage
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:36.240]   to their own finite sinfulness. So my conclusion is, when we read about God giving someone
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:45.360]   over to passions and hardening, we should not conclude that this is always permanent.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.560]   God can and does break in and save.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.600]   Yes, amen. He is a gracious God. Thank you, Pastor John, for those hope-filled words.

[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.680]   Well, on Wednesday, we hear from a Christian who came to embrace Reformed theology in college,
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.320]   and that same believer is now having children of her own and building a family with children
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.560]   that may or may not be elect in Christ. And that reality raises huge questions for young
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.360]   parents like a young mom named Alex. We will hear from her next time on Wednesday. I'm
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.000]   your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.500]   [END]
