[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   There's a possibility that basically every application category gets
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.960]   upended in the next five years.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.080]   I think the whole model of how applications get built across every
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.040]   domain, I think it might just completely change the old model without AI.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.480]   Typically have some sort of database.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.140]   You have some sort of front end of the database.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.220]   You have forms, right?
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.340]   You had these sort of known user interaction models, mobile apps, and so forth.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.960]   We got to a pretty good kind of shared understanding of how humans and machines
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.320]   communicate in the windowing era.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.160]   And then in the mobile era, the web, I think AI might just upend all that.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.220]   And I think the future apps might just be much more of a dialogue
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.280]   between computer and machine.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.220]   It's either a text written dialogue or a spoken dialogue or some other form of
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.380]   dialogue and the human is guiding the machine of what to do and receiving real
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.020]   time feedback and that there's a loop and then the machine just does what it
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.980]   does and it gives you the results.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.300]   The very fundamental assumptions about how software gets built, I
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.380]   think might just completely change.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.700]   And so the, yeah, the tools on that are at the very front end.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.300]   There's an entirely new stack that needs to get built to do that.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.620]   Is there a reason though AI is not one of your focus areas?
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.380]   Or as far as I know, you guys don't have an AI fund dedicated
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.940]   to that technology specifically.
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.620]   So basically what we look at is it's all of software, right?
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.100]   We look at it as like it is the core business.
