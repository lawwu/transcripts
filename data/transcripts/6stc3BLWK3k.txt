[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.880]   The Ask Pastor John podcast inbox
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.960]   now gets about 60 emails every day.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.120]   So you can imagine we are grateful for questions
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.500]   that come in that are sharp and brief and to the point,
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.200]   like this one from podcast listener, Lisa,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.800]   who asks this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.060]   what is the difference between peace and joy?"
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.040]   I love this question because it is so simple
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.120]   and so profound.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.120]   It's the kind of question or the kind of thinking
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.600]   that is so neglected.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.940]   And I mean by me, as well as others.
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.400]   We use words, don't we?
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.960]   We use words often without pausing
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.240]   to give the slightest thought
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.360]   to the precise, deep meaning that they have
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.440]   and how they relate to other similar words.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.560]   So thank you for the question.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.200]   I'm going to assume that what I'm trying to answer here
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.120]   is the difference between Christian peace
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.720]   and Christian joy, okay?
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.320]   The kind talked about in the Bible,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.800]   not just any kind of peace or any kind of joy.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.800]   So let's start with one clear difference.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.320]   Of course, there are ambiguities and there are overlaps.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.080]   We'll get to that, but this clear difference.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.700]   Peace can be a subjective feeling in the heart
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.440]   or an objective state of affairs
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.640]   between two formerly hostile parties.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.240]   Joy, on the other hand, only refers
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.760]   to a subjective feeling in the heart.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.960]   There is no such thing as an objective joy
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.440]   outside of the experience of joy in the heart.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.480]   So for example, Jesus talks about two armies
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.320]   coming against each other and one sends a delegation
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.840]   and asks for terms of peace.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.680]   That is the objective state of affairs
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.640]   of our armies not killing each other.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.080]   Those armies still may hate each other,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.160]   but I've only got 10,000 people, he's got 20,000.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.640]   I want peace.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.920]   I don't want anybody killing each other here.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.960]   So it has an objective state of affairs.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.160]   Or Jesus saying in Luke 12, 51,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.320]   "Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth?
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.680]   No, I tell you, but rather division."
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.760]   In other words, the objective peace in a home
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.400]   may be broken up by some who believe and some who don't.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   Or most importantly are Paul's words in Ephesians 2.14,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.600]   "For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.680]   and has broken down in his flesh
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.880]   the dividing wall of hostility
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   by abolishing the law of commandments
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.520]   expressed in ordinances that he might create in himself
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.400]   one new man in place of two, so making peace
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.040]   and might reconcile us both to God in one body
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.720]   through the cross, thereby killing the hostility."
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.620]   So before there's any subjective feeling of peace
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.280]   in our hearts as Christians,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.660]   God establishes an objective peace in history
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.080]   through the work of Christ by removing the hostility
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   between us and him through the blood of Jesus.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.760]   His wrath is satisfied, our guilt is covered,
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.680]   and because of that objective peace
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.040]   that he has wrought through Christ,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   we now can be overflowing with sweet, deep, inner peace
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.460]   on the basis of it.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.220]   But the New Testament never talks about joy that way.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.700]   To be sure, inner, sweet, subjective feelings of joy
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.700]   are based on objective realities of God's work in Christ.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.580]   But that work does not create an objective thing
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.520]   outside of us called joy.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.340]   It creates peace, and that's one of the differences
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.480]   between joy and peace.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.620]   But now, let me shift gears, 'cause my guess is
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.860]   she really wants to know what's the difference
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.780]   between the two subjective experiences of joy and peace.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.960]   How do they relate to each other?
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.180]   So first, let's be really sure that we see from the Bible
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.500]   that both peace and joy are indeed
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.900]   inner, subjective, happy experiences.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.780]   Romans 15, 13, "May the God of hope fill you
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.520]   "with all joy and peace in believing."
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.800]   So you're the one who's filled with peace.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.040]   You're the one who's filled with joy.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.440]   Or Galatians 5, 22, "But the fruit of the Spirit
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.320]   "is love, joy, peace, patience," and so on.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.080]   So the fruit that the Spirit produces
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.280]   in the heart of the believer includes joy and peace.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.520]   Now, what's the difference in those two
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   inner, subjective experiences based on external,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.720]   glorious redemption in Christ?
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.440]   And here's the way I would put it.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   Christian peace, that subjective feeling of peace
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.720]   rooted in the objective peace of God through Christ,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   that peace is a good feeling in the heart,
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.560]   not just the body, when the heart is not tormented
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.040]   by anxiety and fear and conflict.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.860]   So here's the key passage.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.040]   Philippians 4, verse six, "Do not be anxious about anything,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.180]   "but by prayer and supplication,
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.140]   "let your requests be made known to God,
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.140]   "and the peace of God will guard your hearts and minds."
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.160]   So peace happens when anxieties are removed.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.320]   Peace is the condition of the heart
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.240]   when anxiety and fear and conflict
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.520]   are not troubling the heart.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.720]   And of course, this feeling is a good one.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.880]   One could say a joyful one.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.840]   So here's the ambiguity, right?
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.660]   Here's the interlocking, here's the interplay.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.760]   I was talking about at the beginning
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.160]   when I said there is some ambiguity in the way they relate.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.760]   Joy, however, is a much larger word
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   because the good feeling of joy that comes into the heart
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.800]   doesn't just come from the absence of worry or conflict.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.660]   It comes from other things too, like 3 John 4,
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.180]   "I have no greater joy than to hear
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.160]   "that my children are walking in the truth."
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.240]   Or James 1, 2, "Count it all joy
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.300]   "when you meet various trials."
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.660]   Or Romans 5, 2, "We rejoice in the hope
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.600]   "of the glory of God."
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.280]   So joy is a good feeling in the heart
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.520]   that's based on a much wider range
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.680]   of good things than peace is.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.280]   But they are so interwoven
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.000]   that there could be no true heart experience
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.240]   of Christian joy without the heart experience
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.440]   of Christian peace.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.880]   And there could be no true heart experience
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.440]   of Christian peace without that being
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.520]   a heart experience of Christian joy.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.840]   So they're, best I can do is to say
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.040]   they're like interlocking circles
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   and the joy circle is much bigger
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.080]   than the peace circle, but never disconnected.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.700]   So I say with Paul,
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.760]   may the God of hope fill you
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.440]   with all joy and peace in believing.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.960]   - Wonderful, outstanding survey.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.480]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.320]   Well, the weekend is upon us now.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.280]   A good time to formulate that sharp
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.960]   and concise question that you've been wanting
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.680]   to send in to Pastor John.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.760]   And it's a good time to catch up on past episodes,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.940]   all of which you can do through our free mobile apps
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.000]   and through our web home at DesiringGod.org/web.

[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.600]   Pastor John returns with us again on Monday
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.080]   to talk about another very common Christian cliche.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.320]   I love those episodes.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.160]   I'm your host Tony Ranke.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.280]   We'll see you on Monday.
