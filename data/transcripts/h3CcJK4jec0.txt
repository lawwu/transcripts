[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   All right, I'm here at SHEPCON 2024. Can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.120]   Hi, my name is Jerry Regg, and I am a pastor at Grace Emanuel Bible Church in
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.440]   Jupiter, Florida, and the president of the Expositor Seminary, and I'm here with
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.280]   Gary Kim, one of my dear friends. And Jerry, you also served here at Grace
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.040]   Church, right? I did. I was on staff here for 10 years some time ago, and then in
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.560]   2001 went out to Florida. And Jerry, you've been reading the LSB for a bit.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.000]   What do you think? No, I love it. First of all, I want to say that with regard to
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.840]   trusting translations, I don't think I've had a greater level of confidence than I
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.320]   do now in a translation, because I know that the LSB grew out of the heart of
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.760]   expositors, particularly Dr. MacArthur, over years and years of study. Now, I'm an
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.360]   expositor, and I'm a pastor, so I see translations. I see them come and go. I
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.200]   study when I study for sermons. I'm looking through all of the translations,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.000]   but I know a translation that was made because the heart and soul of an
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   expositor and his team wanted it to be accurate. Well, I can open that thing, and
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.120]   the clarity from the translation and the confidence with that clarity that goes
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.440]   with it, that is a thrill to an expositor. And so I love it already just because of
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.440]   where it came from and its roots. But then as I work through the text, it's so
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.240]   obvious that in those previously ambiguous places, or places where other
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.360]   translations tried to get fancy and clever, the LSB is just right at it,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.400]   straightforward, and I love that. Thanks, Jerry. Thanks for taking the time.
