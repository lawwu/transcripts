[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about why I failed at early retirement and
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.760]   what I plan to do to get my early retirement card back and retire at the age of 45 by
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.640]   2022
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.480]   So for those of you who don't know my background from 2009 to 2011 three years
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.000]   I was struggling to try to make sense of all the chaos in the markets
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.240]   Lost about 35% of my net worth in six months and I was pretty sad depressed scared about my future
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.780]   You know, I'd spent 10 plus years saving aggressively investing diversifying and it still really didn't work
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.440]   So that three-year time period was very difficult
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.760]   But very eventful and very rewarding in the end because I finally figured out how to leave work behind in 2012
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.160]   so I'm thinking over the next three years I can go through somewhat of a similar process and
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.320]   Figure out how I can get back to early retirement
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.240]   And I first want to talk about failure because I listen to the community
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.320]   I listen to what other people say and one of the consistent feedbacks given to me is that I'm an early retirement failure
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.640]   I simply could not anticipate all the costs and things that would happen in my life after I left work
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.200]   And I think that's really really fair and true and it gets better folks instead of being called a failure
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.600]   I'm also being called a loser and I know that's a little bit harsh. But guess what? I love criticism
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.200]   I just want as much criticism as possible because it is giving me the motivation to do better
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.840]   And that's all I really want to do is get better at things because stagnation is kind of doesn't feel really good
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.640]   Progress is my one word definition of happiness think about it progress in your career
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.400]   You're gonna be happy progress in your marriage
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.080]   You're gonna be happy progress and seeing your kids grow up and hit milestones. You're gonna be happy. So for me progress in
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   Developing more and more retirement income so I can get back to retirement or stay retired
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.520]   That makes me happy and just progress in life and try to challenge myself every single day and not be afraid
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.720]   I've long gone past being afraid and I just want to I just want to try actually
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.760]   I'm afraid of not trying because of um, if I'm not trying that means there's something wrong with me
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.360]   So you may have read a pretty popular guest post
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.880]   I wrote for CNBC during the holidays and you may have read a pretty popular post that was featured in Forbes about my desire to
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.920]   Go back to work. Well, those were a bridge versions because of writing lengths and I didn't control those platforms
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.920]   But I do control the financial samurai platform and I wanted to share with you in more detail on why I think I failed at
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.640]   Early retirement. So the first point is that I underestimated my desire for social interaction
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.160]   I'm an extrovert ever since I can remember I remember when I was like five years old in Japan
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.560]   I was walking down the street and I was just randomly talking to everybody for some reason because I liked
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.640]   To talk to people and get to know their stories
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.780]   So I think it's much harder for extroverts to go into retirement and stay retired because we gain energy from other people
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.260]   Further I had one of the most stimulating jobs in the market
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.520]   I remember going to Asia every quarter to visit companies talk to entrepreneurs raise capital
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.800]   I would have to wine and dine clients with a corporate card go to events and you know travel across the country
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.040]   It was really fun and I talked to a lot of smart people and I learned a lot
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.520]   so if you go from 60 hours a week to just
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.480]   Nothing. I mean that's kind of jolting now if I had a
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.860]   Six hour a day job and then I went to nothing I could I could probably transition better, but I really miss the interaction
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.580]   I miss the Christmas parties the holiday parties, you know, I would go to like four or five
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.440]   it would be like wedding crashers or something and everybody was married because
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.440]   Well, there was alcohol and then there was free food and a lot of people were anticipating good bonuses. So what's not to like?
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.860]   and I missed that - I
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.480]   Underestimated how low interest rates would go if you have been reading Financial Samurai since 2009
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.400]   I have been very bullish on real estate and I've been very bullish on bonds because I
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.120]   Believed and I still believe that interest rates will stay low for the rest of our working careers if not our lives
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.480]   We've got it folks since the 1980s interest rates have been coming down
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.640]   Just look at the chart and the reason why is because of efficiency technology
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.480]   Understanding cycles globalization and so forth. We've become better at managing
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.200]   Inflation as well as managing unemployment. Just look at the data
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.800]   But I did underestimate and did not expect the 10-year bond yield to drop to 1.5% in the fall of 2019
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.280]   I thought we'd stayed around two and a half percent, which is still low but going down to 1.5%
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.360]   While there's a bull market in stocks
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.640]   Hmm, that's kind of rare and that was amazing. It was like everything go up in
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.160]   2019 market which is great because I had a pretty large portion of my public investments in bonds
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.440]   So instead of needing a million dollars in additional capital generate fifty thousand dollars at five percent
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.480]   One now has to accumulate 2.5 million in capital at 2% to generate fifty thousand
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.240]   So that is a massive shift in the goalpost
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.680]   Massive and if you are a true retiree who depends on income from your investments to survive. This is not so good because
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.320]   Basically your income is gonna go down now. Look granted you should have appreciation in capital and
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.080]   You could sell your capital and use your capital
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.760]   But I am pretty conservative where I believe the ideal withdrawal rate in retirement
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.280]   Touches no principle and the thing is I used to think two hundred fifty thousand a year was enough to live a middle-class lifestyle
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.560]   with a family in San Francisco, but due to the bull market
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.480]   We get hurt instead. The data now says you need three hundred nine thousand four hundred dollars in
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.200]   minimum household income a year to live in San Francisco and the scary thing is the figure was closer to
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.080]   343,000 in the second quarter of 2019
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.880]   So this number this three hundred ten thousand dollar number is based off a 20% down payment on a 1.6
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.180]   million dollar median priced home and you got to come up with a three hundred twenty thousand dollar down payment, right?
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.640]   And you're supposed to spend no more than twenty eight percent of your gross
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.400]   monthly income on
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:44.360]   Housing expenses, which is probably pretty reasonable. So you're seeing income go down and you're seeing
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.520]   housing costs go up and therefore the required amount of income go up now I
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.640]   Comfortably live on less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year in investment income
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.200]   I comfortably live on less than two hundred thousand dollars a year investment income. We've been doing this for the past three years
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.520]   But hey if this is what?
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.240]   Financial pundits and housing analysts want to say I'll I'll accept it because who am I I'm just an unemployed
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.000]   stay-at-home dad
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.040]   So three I underestimated how much I could love a child and it's one of those things where you don't really know
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.880]   What one type of love is until you have a child, you know how to love your parents
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   You know how to love your relatives, you know how to love your wife your husband your girlfriend your boyfriend
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.720]   But it's a different type of love when you have a child. It's like the most explosive
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.600]   Most magical most consuming feeling I have ever felt before there's a great saying
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.640]   Have kids and the money will come and the simple reason for that saying is that you just get so motivated to work harder
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:57.360]   Stay healthier and just do the right thing for your children that money will just inevitably come and I believe that I believe that
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.040]   Because my energy has gone up
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:06.880]   Maybe about 20 or 30 percent since having my boy and I just want to get going and do something and provide
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.400]   For taxes went down and estate exemption amounts went up
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.800]   so when I left my day job in 2012 a
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:23.480]   $250,000 income faced a demoralizing 33% federal marginal income tax rate and the estate tax exemption
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.840]   Was 5.1 2 million, which was not bad at the time
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   but now a
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:35.700]   $250,000 base salary in 2020 faces only a 24% federal marginal income tax rate and the estate tax
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.960]   Exemption amount has doubled to 11.5 8 million per person
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.000]   so you can die with up to 11.5 8 million and
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.120]   Your heirs or the charities that you donate to don't have to pay any taxes
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.960]   Actually, I don't think don't you know, the charities have to pay any taxes
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.580]   Anyway, check out I think the Mormon Church. I think they save like billions in taxes
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:05.080]   So it seems like we have a limited window to earn as much as possible before tax rates go up and a state tax
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   exemption amounts go down
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:15.320]   Five I never thought that being an early retiree felt right when I was 34 just it just just was weird
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.720]   I felt stupid and when people asked me what I did if I said I did nothing
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:26.160]   I just I just felt kind of shameful, you know living in San Francisco. It's it's it's kind of intense now
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:33.600]   It's like it's where the most motivated type-a people from the most overpriced private universities come to make their fortunes
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.080]   so it's like New York City and if I was in let's say a small town on Maui or
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.720]   Kauai or even in Oahu. I think I could get away with saying yeah, I just retired and I'm just I
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.920]   Don't know taking care of my kids and stuff like that, but I don't I'm stuck in San Francisco where everybody's go go go
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.240]   so I started telling folks about a year after I left my day job that I was a writer and
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.840]   Then more recently over the past three years
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   I've been telling people who asked that I was a high school tennis coach and you know what it felt great
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.880]   It felt great to have this occupational
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.780]   Identity again. So this is something that I think if you retire early or if you just retire
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.380]   You're gonna have to struggle with this occupational identity for a while
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:27.860]   So make sure you retire to something so that you're always feeling like you're part of society and you're doing something to contribute to society
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:34.580]   Okay point number six is where I've gotten the most amount of pushback. I told you people have called me a failure
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.380]   They've called me a loser, but I forgot to tell you they also call me an idiot
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:45.960]   So this is the reason why everybody calls me an idiot as well because I overestimated my ability to move to a lower-cost area
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.220]   People are just like Sam
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:54.460]   Why don't you just leave San Francisco and go live in the boondocks and save tons of money and live like a king?
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.860]   Well, you know what?
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:02.380]   Sorry for someone who has lived in six countries by the time he was 14 and has traveled to over 60 countries so far
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:09.540]   I'm just terrible at relocating. I gotta admit and you know what? My wife doesn't relocate either. So hey, what am I gonna do?
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.580]   I've been seriously thinking about relocating since 2012 after I left my job, right?
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:20.560]   I was gonna sell my house live in a small place and then I don't know do what digital nomads did back then and go
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   to Thailand or Vietnam
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.000]   And I don't know live like a king on $1,000 a month
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.340]   But guess what? I didn't do that. I decided to stay here because I felt that there was still
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:39.220]   Opportunity and then there were still friends and unfinished business. So look I wanted to go to Hawaii in
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:45.260]   2014 and I was ready with my wife to go live a more simple lifestyle of $100,000 in
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.340]   Retirement income which would have provided a very handsome
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.080]   Living there. We didn't have kids then
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.100]   But you know what? I found a panoramic ocean view home in San Francisco
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:02.100]   I didn't even realize there were homes with views ocean views in San Francisco because I was so sheltered living on the east and north
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.260]   Side of the San Francisco. So when I found it, I was like, this is a no-brainer
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:11.980]   I'm gonna bring Hawaii to San Francisco and then it took two years to do all the remodeling
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:18.100]   So I wasn't about to leave I wanted to enjoy all our remodeling efforts and then in 2017
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:24.460]   My son was born and we were just totally totally thrilled. I was thinking well, I
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.380]   Can't leave because I got doctors here. I need some stability. We just finished our house
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.100]   So look I was hoping we would get rejected to preschool in 2020
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:40.420]   It's not not hugely hoping but I was like, we're only applying to three. There's a 10% or less acceptance, right?
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:47.300]   So the chances are we're not getting in but guess what we got and we got into our local preschool. That's five six minutes away
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.860]   It's great. People are nice
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.900]   So I don't think I'm gonna uproot my entire family after spending like a year through the application and waiting process
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:01.360]   To go to Hawaii or anywhere where I don't know. I don't have any connections
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:08.140]   I have no guarantees for anything. So the path of least resistance was just to stay in San Francisco
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.140]   We had our friends our routines our doctors our network
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.620]   It just felt too forced to pull my son from preschool after just getting
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.140]   Acclimated and then going through the entire application process again
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.260]   Instead figuring out a way to make more money does and if you think about it, come on
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.680]   I have been working in finance since 1999
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.860]   Well for 13 years that is and then I've been writing about how to make money since 2009 on financial samurai
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:42.020]   So for me making money trying to make more money focusing on making more money is much easier than
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.260]   Uprooting my entire family to go to a relatively unknown place
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.100]   So if you want to call me an idiot for just trying to make more money
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:57.980]   Well be my guest but I think it's kind of idiotic to change your entire life just to save money again
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.420]   It's much better to build your wealth by making more money
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.900]   Than by saving money because you can only save so much right just like paying off debt
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.940]   You want to pay off your debt?
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.380]   But if you just focus on paying off debt
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.940]   All you're gonna get is no debt whereas we focus on making more money. All you get is total upside
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.340]   All right, moving on seventh point. I just have plenty more time
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.060]   Well, maybe not if you wait until the end
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.740]   But I have plenty more time to be more productive because if I'm not being productive after about a day I get antsy
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.340]   I think I start twitching my thumbs or something
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:36.140]   My boy is in preschool now and for six to eight to maybe nine hours a day
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:42.700]   I've got free time. So am I gonna just kick back and do nothing while he goes to preschool and I pay about
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:50.620]   $2,000 a month in tuition and donations or I'm gonna try to use some of that time to make some money to cover that extra cost
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:57.700]   Well, obviously I'm gonna be more productive and try to do some work to try to cover that cost because that's a lot of money
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.060]   Eight this might surprise you folks
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:08.540]   But maybe I just want to work because I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur when I was in Malaysia. This is middle school
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.020]   I remember
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.300]   getting into a Mercedes 280 SEL a
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:19.100]   Father's friend who was a businessman sent his chauffeur to pick me up and I felt like a baller
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.100]   I was 12 13 years old sitting in the back
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.280]   I remember they covered the seats with like some faux fur and you know
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:33.220]   Windows were tinted and then we drove up to the hills and there we were I arrived at the mansion for a party
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.980]   And I was just in all what are one of these folks do because this is not what my dad does and this is not
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.820]   the house that we live in and
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:46.500]   Our friends aren't like this and they were all entrepreneurs. They were in the food and beverage business. They were in the chicken business
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:52.580]   They're random businesses that made tons and tons of money. So for me, I thought you know, this is a normal path
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.940]   I would like to be rich. I'd like to live a nice life
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.020]   Let's get it. But unfortunately, unfortunately
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:04.280]   I was able to get a well-paying job right out of college, which I which at the time
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.660]   I thought I won the lottery
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.940]   So I wasn't gonna reject the lottery to go
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.500]   I don't know go to China and work in the factory in Shenzhen and try to be an entrepreneur there
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.140]   so the delay of
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.420]   entrepreneurship has been for a while and
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:25.740]   Because I feel like I've been handed such an easy life since I left work in 2012 with the markets keep on going up
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.580]   I feel a little bit like a loser in the sense, right?
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.420]   Maybe the critics are right a little loser metaphorically still living in his mom's basement
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:39.620]   Not paying rent and eating free meatloaf all day. I might not even have to wash my Superman underwear because
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:45.540]   He or she doesn't I don't think my dad would wash anything for me. So it would probably be my mom
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:50.740]   She's so so nice. So by not facing so much hardship after early retirement
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.500]   I squandered away my potential to become a successful entrepreneur
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:00.140]   I don't plan to let that opportunity pass me up anymore in 2020
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.220]   All right. Let me share just several more reasons why I failed that early retirement
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:10.660]   This other one is interesting because I feel bad taking advantage of subsidized health care
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.960]   One of the best strategies some early retirees exercise
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:20.680]   Maybe all or most early retirees exercise is receiving health care subsidies through the Affordable Care Act
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.460]   Also known as Obamacare now despite having a million or more dollars and assets
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.140]   These early retirees feel no shame in receiving subsidized health care
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:36.060]   But the thing is I do I feel like I don't think that's what the ACA is for
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.140]   subsidizing
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.940]   Millionaire or well-to-do early retirees
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:46.780]   I think the ACA was set up to help those deep in the grind who are struggling to make ends meet or do and have
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.780]   full-time jobs or
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:55.700]   Whatnot, so if I'm going to start getting subsidies, that means I'm taking away subsidies and since 1999
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.260]   I've been paying my taxes out the wazoo and
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:05.500]   Donating money and time to charities to help my fellow brothers and sisters in America
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.380]   And I think that's just how it's been for more than 20 years
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:15.220]   So to then be on the receiving end of subsidies after I felt like this country has given me so much
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.260]   It just felt wrong. So I just can't get over that
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.060]   Next reason why I failed early retirement
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.060]   I think this is real and this is
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:30.060]   Something that I've I've known about since I was a kid and that is I lack sufficient intellect
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:37.340]   The fact that after trying so hard for so many years that I can't stay retired shows that I'm not smart enough or wise enough
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.180]   to account for all the important variables
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.580]   No matter how hard I tried when I was a kid. I could never get straight A's
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.780]   I remember specifically saying dad mom. I'm gonna get straight A's this quarter. So I studied like crazy
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.860]   Nope, couldn't get straight A's. I remember getting a very mediocre SAT score
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.140]   It was like 1120 and that was after reading all the Princeton Review guides
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.540]   I never took any courses, but you know, I did the guides and I thought I was focused
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.940]   But I just couldn't get over the 1200 hump
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:13.100]   After graduating from state you which is a state you that I really like the College of William & Mary admittedly
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:18.500]   You know, I got a job but I was then condemned to the chopping block after just two years mainly due to poor performance
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   And then office is silly the dot-com bust
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.020]   But in contrast my Canadian classmate ended up becoming a managing director at age 32
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:32.260]   And I think she's still there crushing it in 2012 before and after I left my day job
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:38.260]   I applied to over a hundred startup and tech jobs online in order to make sure there were no undiscovered opportunities
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.140]   I knew at the time that Airbnb was gonna do great things
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:48.620]   So I applied to three different positions and I was either ignored or rejected from all of them now
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.860]   So if you're thinking about applying for jobs online, I don't know. I would say pass
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.180]   I would say go use a referral go the good old-fashioned route
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:02.780]   Which is networking and in-person referrals because this online job application stuff. I don't think works
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.140]   What else?
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:11.660]   Since 2009 I've written three articles a week without fail and you'd think with so much practice my grammar would improve
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.380]   Yet my writing mastery score is a dismal 26 percent out of a hundred percent
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.580]   according to my Ukrainian friends at grammarly I
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:26.820]   Applied to the night fellowship program because I thought it would be an amazing opportunity to learn network and contribute to online media
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.100]   It's basically a fellowship for
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:36.100]   Journalists and people in online media. I had a non-traditional background working finance while owning a growing personal finance site
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.540]   I thought it would you know provide interesting perspective
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.020]   Nope, didn't even get called in for an interview
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:47.620]   I applied to a couple incubator programs to see if I could leverage financial samurai to create a fintech company
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.100]   After all the platform was built it was growing it was profitable
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:21:00.980]   Nope got rejected from both and then today I fail to realize how angry I've made some people during the chronicling of my
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.100]   financial independence journey
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.020]   Although I believe my reality is just as real as someone else's reality
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.380]   Because the cost of living is so high in the two cities. I spent my entire post college life
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.900]   It turns a lot of people off and I was just too stubborn. I was like, you know what?
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.340]   Forget it. If you don't like what you read don't read it. This is my journey
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.900]   But now I realize well to be smarter. I
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:31.980]   Need to be more broad. I need to be able to relate to more people. Otherwise
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:39.380]   You know, the growth is limited. So thankfully I do have the wisdom and to recognize my intellectual deficiency and as a result
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:46.980]   I'm gonna make some changes going forward. All right at last the final reason why I failed at early retirement. Are you ready?
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:52.380]   We had a baby one fine morning in December at 7 40 a.m
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:58.500]   My wife and I were blessed with a healthy baby girl. We checked into the hospital at 11 30 p.m
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:05.780]   The night before and we couldn't have had a smoother delivery. My wife's OBGYN started her shift at 11 p.m
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.900]   And finished her shift with us. And for those of you who have never had a baby
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.540]   this is really rare because first of all, you just
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.540]   can't time whether you're gonna see your doctor at the hospital or
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:21.380]   You know you might she might be off or he might be off or you might go into labor
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.900]   At a time where he or she gets off work
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:30.580]   So with new life comes new responsibility. There is a tremendous amount of pressure being the sole income provider
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:36.000]   I need to make sure we have a comfortable enough home a safe enough car
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.420]   Enough child care and household help to maintain our sanity and enough funds to pay for her education
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:48.660]   and our son's education if you were to ask me in 2015 whether we'd have two children by
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.660]   2020 and before my wife turned 40 I would say probably not
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.700]   because the first took more than two years to successfully conceive with one false start and
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:05.320]   So we feel very very blessed and I won't fail my family. I can't fail my family
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:11.340]   So this is why I feel that staying retired with two children is just not
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:17.860]   The right thing to do. It's much better to shore up our finances to anticipate
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.860]   Inflation of some of life's most expensive things such as housing
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.180]   Tuition and health care and try to get ahead of the curve
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.020]   Life is really unpredictable folks
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.780]   Early retirement was a nice eight-year run, but all good things must come to an end
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:39.500]   There's just simply too much to do and too much at stake not to go out there and make a living again
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.140]   So there you have it folks
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.500]   I hope I've sufficiently explained my early retirement failure
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:52.980]   And I hope this gives you an idea if you're planning on retiring early what you may face as well in our next episode
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:58.540]   I'm gonna talk about my game plan my early retirement master plan to get back to early retirement by
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:04.960]   2022 with two kids and I've written about it in a post already if you want to take a look but in my episode
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.000]   I'm gonna share a little bit of nuance a little bit of things that I don't write about so stay tuned
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.920]   Thanks so much everyone. Have a great new year
