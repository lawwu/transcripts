[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   What do you think the biggest thing people get wrong when they think about
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.640]   productivity, managing your time is not all about productivity.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.620]   In fact, we think that's sort of the wrong way to look at it entirely.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.300]   Instead, managing your time is about figuring out what matters the most to
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.900]   you in your work, in your life, and finding a way to bring your best efforts
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.260]   to bear on those things that matter the most to you.
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.040]   So to make that happen, we have to forget about a lot of the conventional
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.840]   wisdom about staying on top of things, being as responsive as possible, being
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.560]   the best employee possible in the traditional sense, and we've created a
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.480]   framework for rethinking the way you spend your energy every day, restructuring
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.320]   it around, spending your energy on what is most important.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.600]   So it's a four part framework, and it all starts with a very
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.720]   simple idea that we call the highlight.
