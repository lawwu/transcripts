[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   The thing people get wrong is thinking that more is better with social wealth.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.520]   The tendency is to say like, well, it's because money, like more is better is the mindset
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.520]   people have had.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.060]   And everyone's wired differently around this.
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.080]   One person might feel lonely if they have only 100 friends.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.320]   Another person might feel lonely as long if they have only have one friend, like what
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.760]   social wealth means to different people will be different because you have a natural level
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.820]   of introversion or extroversion, and you need to figure out what level of connection fills
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.820]   your cup.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.920]   It doesn't matter if it's the same, I am more extroverted than my wife.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.620]   My wife really just needs her like very close network of a few friends and family to feel
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.000]   extraordinarily socially wealthy, I need a bigger group of people like I need to feel
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.840]   like I can reach out to different people who have expertise on different things and problems
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.840]   that I'm facing.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.160]   And that's what makes me feel good.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.640]   But it's different for all of us.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.640]   So figuring out your sort of natural set point or baseline, if you will, that you're kind
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.440]   of working towards is important.
