[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Why do people select people that are fundamentally bad for them?
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.360]   OK, so I did a book called You're the One You've Been Waiting For, and in it I talked
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.240]   about this whole issue.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:27.160]   And so for a lot of people, you get hurt by your parent, and there are parts that want
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.460]   to protect you from your parent, but there are other parts who are desperate, who took
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.800]   on the worthlessness from being rejected by your parent, and are desperate for redemption.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.480]   Do you follow this?
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.980]   And so as you leave and you're looking for a partner, that part from a subconscious place
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.620]   can influence your decision to find somebody who resembles that parent in their effort
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.760]   to be redeemed again.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.720]   Is this anything like the repetition compulsion that we tend to repeat a pattern over and
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.840]   over again as an attempt to resolve, not just a manifestation of dysfunction?
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440]   That's a version of what I'm talking about.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.560]   And so you find somebody who does resemble that person, that parent, and unfortunately
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.320]   they do resemble that parent, and so they'll hurt you in the same way.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.040]   And then your protectors go into one of four modes, they'll say, "I've got to change that
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.600]   person back into who they're supposed to be," so they'll try to change the person's behavior,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.520]   or they'll say, "I've got to change myself so they'll be who they're supposed to be,"
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.420]   or they'll say, "Oh, this wasn't the Redeemer after all," and they'll go looking for the
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.680]   real Redeemer who's still out there.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.680]   As always, inside.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.640]   And, yeah, that's what I try to do, is to help them see that that Redeemer is inside
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.160]   of them, it's self.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.840]   And if we can go to that exile who's got this thing for this parent-like person and help
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.520]   it connect to self and help it unburden, that whole repetition compulsion disappears, because
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.080]   now they can take care of themselves.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.240]   They trust self to do it, they don't need that from some other person like that.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.600]   And so when we're working with couples, and you always find some version of that in couples,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.800]   if we can get each of them to become their own good attachment figure, good caretaker
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:43.360]   inside, that frees up the partner, because when this exile is leading the relationship,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.740]   your partner feels a lot of sort of demands, or feels a lot like your partner has to take
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.720]   care of that young part of you, and can't, can't fully do it.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.720]   So there's always this sense of, oh, a burden, you know what I'm saying?
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.840]   It's so interesting how romantic relationships are where these patterns get repeated.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.000]   And at the same time, numerous examples in my life of healthy relationships is that usually
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.840]   the case because people have done the work before, or because they had a minimum of trauma
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840]   in their upbringing?
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840]   Both.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.080]   What percentage of kids, adults as well, do you think had a minimum of trauma, are just
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.240]   because of the way they're wired, and the way this stuff is organized within them, that
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.560]   they naturally attach to a good partner and are pretty healthy?
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.280]   Is it like 25%, 30%?
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   Is it--
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.720]   I really can't say because my sample is very skewed.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.520]   I'm working with psychotherapy patients who always have a lot of trauma.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.480]   So I really can't say.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.880]   I mean, I'm very biased.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.880]   Half of marriages in this country end in divorce.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:11.080]   And presumably of the ones that don't, I'm guessing somewhere between a half and a quarter
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.640]   of those people are really unhappy.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   Sounds so pessimistic.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.400]   But if you just look at the numbers, and I'm an optimist, I already acknowledge that I
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.120]   don't like to think about bad stuff.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.880]   So yeah, I'm guessing that a lot of people repeat these patterns.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.840]   But it seemed as if maybe 20, 30 years ago, because these ideas weren't discussed really.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:50.160]   So many fewer people were in any kind of analysis or personal exploration work, that as a society,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   we defaulted to just sort of role execution.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.120]   You're a father and a husband, so you do certain things.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.080]   And you don't do certain things.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.800]   You're a wife and a mother, so you do certain things, and you don't do certain-- and so
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.860]   on.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.320]   And I think nowadays, there's a lot of discussion about is there a resurgence of organized religion
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.080]   because we've drifted so far from these kind of core structures?
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.840]   I mean, love your thoughts on that.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.880]   And also what you think doing this kind of internal work on oneself without requiring
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.360]   any input or participation from another, what the value of that is.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.740]   It sounds like there's tremendous value to just doing this work for oneself, maybe with
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.420]   someone trained in IFS.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.420]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.000]   I mean, like I was saying, there's a lot you can do with working with your protectors and
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.200]   helping them get to know self.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:56.040]   We didn't do it, but had you asked that titanium teddy bear how old it thought you were and
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.920]   just really waited for the answer, most people will get a single digit.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.720]   It still thinks you're very young, and it still thinks it has to protect you the way
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.300]   it did when you were very young.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.080]   And just even updating it creates a huge amount of relief with these protectors.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.280]   So there's a lot that can be done just by working with protectors, introducing them
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.840]   to self, helping them see they don't have to keep doing this all the time.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.620]   Some protectors, it's very hard for them to totally drop their weapons until what they
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.240]   protect has been healed.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.320]   So that's where the therapist comes in.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.960]   There are coaches doing this work, for example.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   They'll work with some executive, and they'll do great, and then they'll get to an exile.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.520]   And then they'll have the person see an IFS therapist for a couple of sessions to heal
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.960]   the exile and then come back, because coaches aren't trained as therapists.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   So yeah, there's still need for therapists, but you can do a lot on your own.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:19.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
