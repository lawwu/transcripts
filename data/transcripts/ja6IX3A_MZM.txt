[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Well, how does God's sovereignty over every life not make each of us robots?
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.640]   Where is the place for human willpower and for decision-making?
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.560]   And how does God govern over all of those decisions that we make?
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.080]   It is a great question from a listener named Max in Lincoln, Nebraska, my home
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.180]   state, shout out to Scott Frost and the Huskers.
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.100]   All right.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.520]   Here's the question from Max in Lincoln.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.940]   Pastor John, thank you for all your episodes over the years.
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.540]   This podcast nourishes my soul, but I am also thick headed and a lot of important
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.780]   theological points come to me very, very slowly.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.480]   Can you explain again how God's sovereignty over human decisions and
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.180]   actions comes through his control over our affections such that we are not
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.940]   robots responding moment by moment to individual commands and prompts in
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.400]   situations, but that he is in control of our decisions as we freely choose what
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.980]   we want?
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.380]   I think I'm on the verge of understanding you and Edwards and the reform tradition
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.480]   on this, but can you make this all clear in 10 minutes so Tony doesn't scold you
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.040]   for going long again?
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.960]   What would you say to Max?
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.200]   Well, the likelihood that I could put in 10 minutes what 2,000 years of church
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.440]   history has not succeeded in completely clarifying for the best of minds is not
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.700]   very likely, but there aren't many things more important than the sovereignty of
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.280]   God in our personal lives and how we make choices.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.360]   And the way we think about this does have implications for how we worship and serve
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600]   and persevere as Christians.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.440]   So let's make a stab at it.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.260]   I'm going to lay out seven points in what I think is a biblical view of the
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.580]   relationship between the human will and God's sovereignty.
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.380]   Each one could have a book written about it.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.900]   So these are simply pointers with biblical passages to think about.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.300]   Point number one, until they are born again by the power of God's spirit, all
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.620]   human beings ever since Adam are spiritually blind, 2 Corinthians 4, 4,
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.500]   darkened in their understanding, hardened in their heart, Ephesians 4, 18, unable to
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.540]   grasp spiritual truth, 1 Corinthians 2, 14, rebellious against God, Romans 8, 7,
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.740]   spiritually dead in trespasses, Ephesians 2, 5, enslaved to sin, Romans 6, 6, unable
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.060]   to please God, Romans 8, 8.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.460]   That's point one.
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.820]   Pretty devastating bondage.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.460]   Point number two, all people are still responsible in that condition, accountable
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:18.540]   to God, liable to judgment, because this darkness that they are in, this slavery
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.780]   that holds them, has its power over them, not against their will or against their
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.900]   desires, but precisely because of their will and because of their desires, they
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.820]   love sin so much.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.300]   Jesus said in John 3, 19, "The light has come into the world and people loved the
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.940]   darkness rather than the light, because their works were evil."
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.420]   The problem is not that we lack light, but that we love darkness.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.820]   This is not a bondage against people's will.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.420]   This is a bondage because of their will.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.740]   Point number three, this deep evil in all human hearts does not limit the complete
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.060]   sovereignty of God over all things, including the fallen human will.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.220]   Proverbs 21, 1, "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.500]   He turns it wherever he will."
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:33.340]   Ezra 6, 22, "The Lord made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.060]   Assyria to them so that he aided them in the work of the house of God."
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.940]   Genesis 26, "Then God said to Abimelech," this is the pagan king who had not
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.140]   committed adultery with Sarah, Abraham's wife, "He said to Abimelech, 'It was I
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.540]   who kept you from sinning against me.'"
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.340]   In other words, God was ruling in the will of a pagan king.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.300]   Genesis 20, verse 6, Proverbs 16, 1, "The plans of the heart belong to man, but
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.940]   the answer of the tongue is from the Lord."
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.380]   Acts 4, 27, "In this city, Jerusalem, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, along with the
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.500]   Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together to do whatever your
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.060]   hand and your plan had predestined to take place."
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:32.140]   God is profoundly, thoroughly in control of the fallen will of man.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:39.460]   Point number four, by the sovereign, regenerating, life-giving, blindness-
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:48.660]   removing, hardness-replacing, light-shining work of the Holy Spirit, God replaces
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.700]   blindness with the light of reality and breaks the deceptive bondage of sin
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.500]   and sets people free.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.660]   That's what it means to be saved, what it means to be converted, born again.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.580]   Second Corinthians 4, 6, God said, "Let light shine out of darkness," and He's
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.100]   shown in our hearts with that light to give the light of the knowledge of the
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.140]   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.180]   That's the meaning of conversion.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.660]   Romans 6, 20, "For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.460]   righteousness.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:36.860]   But now that you have become free from sin and have become slaves of God, the end
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.420]   you get is eternal life."
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:45.620]   So this slavery to God now in the regenerate, in the born again, this slavery
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.700]   to God is the same kind of slavery that we had to sin in this sense.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.380]   It's not a slavery contrary to our will.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:03.420]   We were enslaved to sin because sin looks so good and desirable to us.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:10.460]   Our will was all in with sin, and we are enslaved to God because God looks so good
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.180]   and so desirable to us, and our will is all in with God.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.500]   That's what happened in the new birth.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:27.180]   Point number five, this new slavery to God is true freedom for three reasons.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:33.140]   One, like slavery to sin, it is completely willing.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:40.060]   We are not controlled or coerced against our desire, against our will, but by means
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.060]   of new and powerful desires.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   Second, these new desires, unlike the desires for sin, accord with, agree with,
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.980]   are in harmony with what is true and beautiful and lasting, God's righteousness,
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.820]   God's way, John 8:32.
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.820]   We're not being deceived.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.940]   We have been set free from deception.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.980]   And third, this new slavery to God is true freedom.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:18.620]   Thirdly, because our former so-called freedom ended in everlasting death,
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.300]   and our new freedom, our slavery to God, ends in eternal joy.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:30.020]   You're not really free if you're doing what you want to do and you are miserable
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.500]   for it for eternity.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.780]   You're free if you do what you want to do and don't regret it a million years.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:45.620]   Point number six, this new freedom does not limit the complete sovereignty of God
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.140]   over all things, including the redeemed human will.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:58.100]   Hebrews 13, 21, "God is working in us that which is pleasing in his sight."
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.220]   God is doing this through Jesus Christ, "to whom be glory."
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.700]   Yes, not to us, but to him forever and ever.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.980]   This doesn't mean we can't grieve the Spirit of God, Ephesians 4, 30, but it does
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:18.220]   mean that God lets himself be grieved as part of his larger purpose, which always
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.780]   comes to pass.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:26.500]   For it says in Ephesians 1, 11, "He works all things according to the counsel of his
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.020]   will."
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.020]   So in this new freedom, God is still sovereign over our wills.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:41.660]   Lastly, point number seven, "Nevertheless, God's way of ruling the redeemed will not
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:48.740]   compromise our responsibility or nullify the freedom which is true freedom."
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.620]   How can this be?
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.300]   I think that's probably the nub of the question that's being asked.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.420]   How can this be?
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.900]   And I doubt that we will fully understand that until we get to heaven.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:10.380]   But there is a glimpse, I think, of how it might be in 2 Corinthians 3, 17 and 18.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.660]   Think carefully.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.060]   Now, the Lord is the Spirit.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.220]   Jesus is the Spirit.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.740]   And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:28.460]   And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.420]   This is what freedom looks like.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:36.620]   Being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.180]   And then he adds again, "This comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.580]   So he begins with, "The Lord is the Spirit."
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.780]   And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.700]   That's where he begins in verse 17.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.540]   And then he ends, "This comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.100]   In other words, it seems like he's saying this.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:11:03.620]   When the Spirit of God transforms us to God's will, to love God's will, to conform to God's will,
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:09.780]   and thus reflect the glory of God, this is true freedom.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:18.780]   And the reason it is true freedom is that this transformation is happening through beholding the glory of the Lord.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.300]   Not by any kind of coercion, but by beholding the glory of the Lord.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   The compelling savor of Christ, we're compelled by savoring Christ.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:36.900]   That compelling savor is awakened by seeing Christ.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:42.700]   That seems to be at the heart of what freedom is in Paul's understanding.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:52.980]   When you see Christ for who he is, it awakens such an authentic, freeing, savoring of Christ that he says,
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.140]   "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.980]   Of course, there are many more questions.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:07.180]   And for some of them, I doubt that we will have answers until we see Jesus face to face.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:17.220]   But I think these seven points are biblical and crucial for enjoying our freedom in Christ
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:24.780]   and living under and living worshipfully under the glorious sovereignty of God.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.980]   Beautiful.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.500]   Amen.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.380]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that 11-minute answer.
