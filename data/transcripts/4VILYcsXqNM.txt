[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   Having started with our consideration of man in this world, and having seen the futility
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.080]   of trusting only to our own understanding, we came to see, as mankind has ever come to
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.520]   see, the need of a revelation.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.360]   God has given us that revelation, and he has given a revelation of himself in his word.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.920]   Then having considered what the word tells us about God, we then went on to consider
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.960]   what it tells us about men, and about his needs, and the cause of his needs.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.560]   That introduced the doctrine of sin.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.880]   Then that leads to the need of salvation, and we've considered that in the person of
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.760]   the Lord Jesus Christ and in his work, and then in the application of all that to us
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.880]   by the operation of the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.280]   And eventually the work of the Holy Spirit is to bring us together to form the body of
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.360]   Christ, the Church.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   Now that is the way in which we've arrived at this particular doctrine.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:12.160]   And now we are going on to consider this, as to how in the Church we are built up and
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.720]   established in our most holy faith.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.760]   And that is, in other words, we come to a consideration of the means of grace.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:32.760]   How are Christian people in the Church built up, strengthened, encouraged, and established?
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.480]   Now I don't want to stay too long with this, but it's essential that we should approach
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.200]   the biblical teaching about the sacraments in that way, because there have been different
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.320]   ideas as to the means of grace.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.960]   Now in the Roman Catholic Church, they in a sense recognize only one means of grace,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.440]   and that is the sacraments.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.640]   The teaching of that church really is that all grace comes to the believer through the
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.280]   sacraments—baptism, and the communion of the Lord's Supper, and so on.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.920]   The various other sacraments which they recognize, which I shall deal with in a moment.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.520]   Now they say that grace comes to us in that more or less mechanical manner through the
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   sacraments.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.280]   That's one idea as to the means of grace.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.560]   Then the extreme opposite of that is the view that was originally taught and propounded
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.760]   by the Quakers, and is still in a sense held by them.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.800]   Namely their teaching about the inner light, that the only means of grace really is the
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.360]   internal operation of the Holy Spirit in the believer, and that nothing else is necessary.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.000]   That as long as you have the working and the operation of the inner light, the Spirit of
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.680]   God within you, you really need nothing further.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.040]   That's the extreme opposite, as you can see, from the Roman Catholic position.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.640]   Then another view which has arisen historically, generally, as a reaction against both the
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.280]   Roman Catholics and the Quakers, is the view which says that the only means of grace is
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.920]   the Word, the written Word, the scriptures, and that there is no other means of grace
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.880]   whatsoever but the Word of God itself.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.520]   Whether it's read or whether it's spoken and preached or taught, whatever form it may
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.320]   come, that the Word itself and alone is the means of grace.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.000]   Well now, obviously, we can't go into all this in detail.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.120]   I don't know that it would actually be profitable to do so apart from anything else.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.360]   But in any case, we haven't the time.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.480]   Let us therefore content ourselves with putting it like this, that the traditional Protestant
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.960]   teaching about this matter is that grace comes to us, and the means of grace are really the
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.800]   Word and the sacraments.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.320]   That the believer receives grace through the Word of God and the application of the Word
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.160]   of God to him by the Holy Spirit and through the sacraments.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   And of course, as I shall be showing in a moment, the sacraments must never be separated
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   from the Word.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.040]   You see, that was why some Protestant fathers said that it was the Word only, because as
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.940]   they pointed out very rightly, the sacraments can't do it without the Word.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.480]   But that is a little extreme, and therefore we say that the normal means of grace are
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.520]   the Word, the preaching and the teaching, or the reading of the Word under the illumination
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.360]   and guidance of the Spirit, and the sacraments.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.640]   Very well.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   That brings us to a consideration of the biblical teaching concerning the sacraments.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.480]   Now, what exactly do we mean by this?
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.000]   This is a term that has been used, as you know, traditionally in the Christian church
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.920]   for many centuries.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.360]   And yet, I am very ready to agree with those who say and who teach and have always taught
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.520]   that it's very unfortunate that this word should ever have been used.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.200]   It's a word that is not found in the Scriptures.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.080]   It isn't a scriptural term.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.160]   It's a word that has been introduced into the church and her teaching in subsequent
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   centuries.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.560]   There is very little point in going to examine the philology or the derivation of the word
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   sacrament.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.720]   I refer to it only because it does help us to see how the word ever was chosen by the
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   church.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.320]   A sacrament is a Latin word.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.720]   It originally meant this.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   When two people went to law, one was bringing a charge against another.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.240]   You've got two parties to a legal action always.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.440]   There's the one who brings the petition and there's the other who defends.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.960]   Well, it was the custom in ancient law that both parties deposited a certain amount of
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.760]   money in the court.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   And then when the case was decided, the money of the men who lost the case was given by
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.240]   the court for certain religious purposes.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.360]   Now that deposit of money was called a sacrament.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:53.280]   And it was from that use of the word that it was brought into this whole question of
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.200]   baptism and the Lord's Supper.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.280]   A kind of deposit, you see.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.520]   A kind of pledge.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.600]   That's where the idea came in.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.640]   Then it's been mixed up, unfortunately, with another idea, which is a Greek idea,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.040]   the word for mystery.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.920]   And that, you see, came in in this way.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:21.480]   With the pagan religions, you were generally initiated into membership of these pagan religions
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.720]   by means of some sort of rite or ceremony, some initiation ceremony.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.440]   I believe that there are certain—well, I mustn't be controversial.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.160]   But I was going to say a certain pagan movement still which practiced that kind of thing.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.680]   They have some kind of initiatory rite of entry, so one understands.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.000]   Well, now, that was certainly true of the mystery pagan religions in the ancient world.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.120]   And that idea was borrowed by the Christian church in order to describe this means of
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   grace which comes to people in this particular way.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:04.580]   I say it's unfortunate that these terms have ever been used, but that is exactly how
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.760]   they came to be used.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.560]   Well, we perhaps have got to take things as they are.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.640]   Personally, I try not to use this term.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.400]   And when I announce here on Sundays that there is to be a service following the main service,
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.500]   I say that at the close of this service we hope to meet together at the communion table
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.120]   to partake of the Lord's Supper.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.840]   I don't say that the sacrament of Holy Communion will be administered, and I do that
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   quite deliberately.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.920]   However, the term is used, and it's only right that we should know what people mean
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.440]   when they use the term.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.800]   Well, now, what are the definitions that have been given historically of the sacraments?
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.000]   Well, let me just read two of them to you.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.280]   Take for instance the way in which it's defined in the 25th article of the 39 articles
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.920]   of the Church of England.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:03.520]   They say, "Sacraments instituted by Christ are not only the badges and tokens of the
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:12.120]   profession of Christian men, but rather they be sure certain witnesses and effectual signs
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:19.320]   of grace and of God's goodwill toward us, by the which he doth work inwardly in us and
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.240]   doth not only quicken but also strengthen and confirm our faith in him."
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.520]   Don't try to remember all that.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.720]   It's a useful definition, and I shall put it to you in detail in a moment.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.120]   Then take the Westminster Confession that defines it like this.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:42.880]   It says, "A sacrament is a holy ordinance instituted by Christ in his Church to signify,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.160]   seal, and exhibit to those who are within the covenant of grace the benefits of his
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:57.120]   mediation to increase their faith and all other graces, to oblige them to obedience,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.600]   to testify and cherish their love and communion with one another, and to distinguish them
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   from those that are without."
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.400]   It goes on to say that the parts of a sacrament are two.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.160]   The one an outward and sensible sign used according to Christ's own appointment, the
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:22.160]   other an inward and spiritual grace thereby signified.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.480]   Sometimes it's been defined like that, that it's an outward visible sign of an inward
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.880]   spiritual grace.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:38.440]   Well, now those are the two famous definitions of what is meant by what is called a sacrament.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:44.840]   Now it's very important that we should pay attention to this for this good reason.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.720]   As we are going to remind ourselves, and as those definitions have reminded us, this is
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.240]   not a human invention.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.880]   It is our Lord himself who has commanded his people to do these things.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:05.320]   And there can be very little doubt that the reason for doing so is this, that it is calling
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:12.680]   on the aid of something which can be seen to help that which has been heard.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:19.560]   Now there is no doubt at all, but that most people are helped by seeing things.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.600]   That's why when you teach children the alphabet, you generally do it in the form of pictures.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.160]   You say A for apple, so you put a picture of an apple, and the child remembers the apple
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.080]   because it's something that it can see.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.200]   A for apple.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.160]   Children are always helped by pictures.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:45.440]   It's easier to learn things by having a visual representation than it is by just listening
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.760]   and taking it in with the ear.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:54.200]   Now again, it's obvious there's a temptation, isn't there, to digress at that point and
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:01.000]   to point out that there is nothing really so tragic about the age in which we are living
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.080]   and the increasing and accumulating evidence that people today, in spite of their education
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:12.360]   and their vaunted culture, are finding it increasingly difficult to take in truth by
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.760]   listening and are increasingly calling for visual aids.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.600]   It's an awful confession, but it seems to be the truth.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:28.720]   Well there is no doubt at all, but that that is the principle that is here involved.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.920]   So that in addition to hearing the word and receiving it in that way, the Lord in his
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:43.400]   infinite kindness and condescension has stooped to our weakness and has provided visual aids,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.120]   something we can see, to help us to grasp that which we have already heard and which
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.560]   has been addressed to the understanding.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.140]   Very well.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:13:00.600]   Now then, you've got something outward and visible and external which is to lead to and
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.380]   to aid an inward grace.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:10.080]   So the question that at once arises is, what is the relationship that exists between the
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:16.220]   outward sign and the grace which is signified by it?
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.900]   Now you see the importance of that question.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.100]   What is the relationship, if you like, of the bread and the wine in the communion to
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.140]   the grace that we receive in that way?
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:33.820]   What is the relationship, if you like, between the water in baptism and the grace that is
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.140]   received in that way?
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:44.900]   Now here is a question which has led, as you know, throughout the centuries to great discussions
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:51.900]   and disputations.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.900]   Indeed, a great mass of literature has been devoted to this subject, and it is a most
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.660]   fascinating and entrancing subject.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.380]   And yet I feel that unless one is very careful, one can waste a lot of time in going through
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.380]   it.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.500]   But let me try to summarise it for you.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.300]   There are various views with regard to the relationship of these two things.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:15.380]   Now I trust that we all see that we are considering something very practical.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:20.300]   If you don't, let me ask you a simple question before I go any further.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.740]   What is your real understanding of what happens in baptism?
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.380]   What really is your understanding of what you do yourself when you take bread and wine
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.420]   at the communion service?
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.820]   What is your idea about the bread and the wine?
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.820]   What does it mean?
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   And so on.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.820]   Now that is the subject we are discussing.
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.500]   What is the relationship between the symbols or elements and the grace which they represent
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.500]   and symbolise?
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.780]   Now then, here are the main ideas with respect to it.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:55.380]   Again in the Roman Catholic teaching, and not only Roman Catholic but of course Anglo-Catholic,
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:01.500]   any teaching that delights in the name Catholic, and there are various schools of that, and
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.340]   it isn't confined to the Anglican Church, there are various sections in most of the
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:12.260]   denominations which hold what they call a high sacramentarian doctrine.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.740]   There are sacramental societies in certain free churches even these days.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:23.740]   And in addition to Anglo-Catholicism, there is something that calls itself Scotto-Catholicism,
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.460]   a section of high sacramental teaching in the Church of Scotland in other words.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:39.980]   So now the Catholic idea is this, that the grace is contained in the very elements of
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.660]   the sacrament.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:49.580]   That in other words, the grace is in the bread and the wine and in the water.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:57.380]   Now that it's actually there, so that you receive the grace by taking the bread and
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:02.900]   the wine or by having the water sprinkled, that it's as mechanical as that.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:10.060]   That it's like having an injection, that the grace is something that resides in the
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:20.740]   very elements, so that if you take the bread and eat that bread, whatever may be your condition,
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.860]   whatever be the condition of the man who gives you the bread, you are actually and of necessity
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.140]   receiving grace.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.660]   The grace is in the substance and it acts automatically.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:40.100]   Now the technical term for that is that it acts ex opere operato, which means it acts
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:46.380]   as it were in its own strength and in its own being, ex opere operato.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.820]   Now that is the Catholic teaching about this.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:55.420]   Now the extreme opposite from that was a teaching that was put forward and is held by many today,
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:02.060]   but it was originally put forward by one of the Swiss reformers of the name of Zwingli.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:09.300]   Now he reacted very violently against this Catholic teaching and he said that what are
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:15.700]   called sacraments are really nothing but external signs, that they have no other function, no
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.700]   other purpose at all.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:24.260]   That they're just as it were signs or symbols and that their only function is that they
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:31.620]   commemorate or bring back to mind and to memory something that has happened in the past.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.620]   He said there's not only nothing in them themselves, but they in no sense bring us
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.620]   grace.
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:42.580]   It's simply an external enactment of something in that way.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:48.180]   It's purely symbolical and it is mainly commemorative.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:54.220]   And we therefore by taking the bread and the wine are simply calling to mind something
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.460]   that our Lord once did.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.740]   Now that was Zwingli's teaching with regard to this matter.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:12.260]   Now the again traditional reform teaching, the typical Protestant teaching in other words,
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:19.900]   is neither of those, but can be put like this, that the sacraments so-called not only signify
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:29.020]   grace, but as you notice the two definitions put it, they seal the grace also.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.740]   Now you realize now why I read that fourth chapter of the epistle to the Romans at the
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.500]   beginning.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.780]   You notice what Paul there says about circumcision in the eleventh verse.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:49.100]   He said that Abraham received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.740]   of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.260]   Now he had this righteousness of faith before he was circumcised.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.380]   Well then why was he circumcised?
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:11.080]   Well the teaching is that it was given to him as a sign and as a seal of the righteousness
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.560]   of faith which he had already received.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:22.420]   Now that is the basis of the traditional Protestant definition of what is meant by a sacrament.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.740]   It is a sign of course.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.060]   It is an external sign.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.820]   It is something visual as I have already taught you.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:37.060]   Yes but it is more than that and this is where we part company with Zwingli who said it was
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.380]   nothing but a sign.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.380]   In addition to being a sign it is also a seal.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.180]   Now what do you mean by a seal?
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.420]   Well as you know a seal is something that authenticates a promise.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.780]   You put your seal on a document.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.080]   It doesn't add to the document.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.160]   As such it doesn't add to the statements of the document.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.060]   But it is a further authentication.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:07.260]   It seals the truth of what is stated in the document.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:13.620]   Now it was in that way that circumcision was a seal for Abraham.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.220]   Not only a sign but also a seal.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.260]   Now let me give you another example of the same thing.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.740]   The rainbow is a seal in exactly the same way.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:33.340]   God gave the rainbow, you remember, as a kind of seal confirming the truth that he had already
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:39.080]   declared with regard to his relationship to the world.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:44.400]   He said that the world should never again be drowned like that, in that way, by a flood.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:52.200]   But he not only said it, he gave the rainbow as a seal, a further confirmation.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.760]   Now this is rather important because it seems to me that here we come to the very essence
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.960]   of the truly Protestant teaching with regard to this matter.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.480]   So I will use another illustration.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.320]   Take the use of a ring.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:18.920]   If you like, an engagement ring or a marriage ring, wedding ring, it doesn't matter which.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.300]   Now why does anybody ever give a ring?
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.440]   Why does anybody ever receive a ring?
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:31.040]   It's not essential, but it is the custom, it is the practice.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.480]   And you see there is something in it.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.280]   And the value of the ring is that it is a seal.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   It's something that seals the statement that has already been made.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.640]   It really doesn't add to the statement in one sense.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.880]   And yet there is value in it.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.000]   And the person who has the ring can look at the ring and knows and is reminded of what
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   that ring represents.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.840]   But the thing I'm emphasizing at the moment is that the act of giving or placing on that
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:08.200]   ring is an action on the part of a person who is sealing a promise to the other person.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.920]   Now then, that is the way in which you look at these matters.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:19.200]   The sacraments you see the 39 articles tell us and the Westminster Confession are not
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:25.400]   only signs but they are also seals of this grace.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.320]   They confirm the grace that we've already received.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.180]   Yes, shall we go further?
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:39.280]   They even exhibit it, says the Westminster Confession.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.640]   And what it means by exhibit is this, that in a sense it conveys it.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.280]   Now this is where you have to be careful.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   Because the moment you say that a sacrament conveys grace, ah, people say, haven't you
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.000]   suddenly become a Roman Catholic?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.400]   Aren't you saying now then that it's conveyed by the means and by the symbols?
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.880]   Now let me show you the difference.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.320]   The Roman Catholic, the Catholic teaching is that the grace is mechanically in the symbols.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.200]   That that bread has become the actual body of Christ.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.120]   That's the teaching of transubstantiation as you know.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.720]   And they say in the same way that grace enters into the water of baptism so that the water
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   is no longer water, it contains grace as it were in solution.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.400]   And it is conveyed mechanically in that way.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.040]   But what I am now teaching doesn't say that at all.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.700]   All it's saying is this.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:45.880]   Take the case of a young man becoming engaged to a young woman.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.360]   He's already expressed his love.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.240]   He's made it plain and clear.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.640]   He's repeated it.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   He's shown emotion.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   He's done everything.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.400]   Yes.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.560]   But isn't it true to say at the same time also that when that young lady receives that
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:08.760]   engagement ring, she feels she has received something additional, something extra.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.120]   Now in a fundamental sense she hasn't.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.640]   She's already got that man's love and he's not giving her any more love.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.800]   And yet to her it is a receiving of a love in a special way which she has not already
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.600]   received.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:29.360]   Now it is in that kind of way that the Protestant teaching says that the elements are actually
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.600]   a means of conveying grace to us.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.980]   In other words, that young lady every time she looks at that ring has got a kind of seal.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:46.400]   She finds an assurance there to confirm what she already believes and knows.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.360]   It is an extra confirmation.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.280]   It seals it to her.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.340]   And that is what they emphasize by these terms.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:02.600]   Now that is the value, as you see, of a ring or of a key which conveys admission.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.160]   It's the value of a deed when an estate is conveyed from one person to another and so
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.640]   on.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.400]   So that it's not merely a sign, it is furthermore a seal.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:22.680]   Circumcision was not only a sign, it was also a seal of the righteousness of faith.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:28.200]   So this is a scriptural distinction and it is very important that we should pay due heed
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.440]   to it.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.600]   So that when you and I receive any one of these sacraments, we must realize that it's
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   not merely some external representation.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.440]   It is truly a means of grace.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.840]   And we should be conscious of receiving something in that special way which we only receive
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.740]   in that way.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.120]   Now you'll see the relevance of all this when we come to deal separately with baptism
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.880]   and with the Lord's Supper.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.820]   Very well then, but let me underline all I've been trying to say by putting it in this form.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.680]   What is the design of a sacrament?
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.800]   What's it designed to do?
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.160]   Well then we answer by saying that first it is meant to signify, to seal, and to convey
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:17.280]   to those who are within the covenant of grace the benefits of Christ's redemption.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.720]   Look at it like this.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.120]   They have heard the proclamation of the gospel.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.200]   They have heard the statement of God's grace in Christ through the preached word.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.440]   Very well you say, what more than that can they ever have?
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:37.640]   Well this, God himself, the Lord himself has designed this.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.720]   It is he who has commanded us to do this.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:47.920]   When a person is baptized he should be conscious that that grace is conveyed to him personally
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.720]   in a special way, as the lady does with the ring.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.160]   It's to you.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.640]   In the same way when we take the bread and the wine at the communion table, we should
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.840]   regard it as God saying, "Now this is the way that I have chosen to tell you that my
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.560]   grace is given to you in particular.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.440]   You are admitted to this.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.560]   You are a member of the body.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.960]   And I am telling you through this bread and through this wine that my grace is coming
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   to you."
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.360]   That's his way of saying it.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.980]   He didn't have decided on that but he did.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.280]   It is the Lord who ordained it.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:30.480]   And he told the apostle Paul that, you remember, as he tells the church at Corinth, "He has
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.680]   received of the Lord that which also I have committed unto you, that the Lord Jesus the
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.720]   same night in which he was betrayed."
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   You remember.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   Now that's it.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.240]   And it's been ordained to help us in that way.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.960]   Well that's the first design of a sacrament.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:58.200]   The second is that it is also a visible badge or sign of our membership of the church.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:04.240]   In other words, that those who are baptized and those who come to take the communion,
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:11.700]   they have a kind of badge or token of the fact that they are members of the church.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.840]   So it has those two main functions.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.620]   But the first is the important one.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.140]   It is God's way of telling us that directly.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:26.500]   He speaks to us in symbols and he does it in this special way that what I have believed
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.400]   in general I know now personally is mine.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.280]   That's its intent and object.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.280]   Well now then we ask a question, then, are these absolutely essential?
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.140]   Well of course it depends what view you take of them.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.580]   If you take the Catholic view, they are absolutely essential.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.600]   Because if you don't take them, you're not receiving grace.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.820]   And it's the only means of grace.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:56.080]   And that is why you see at all costs they must go to the sacrament.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.680]   They may neglect the preaching of the word and many other things, but they must go to
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   the sacrament.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.600]   They must have it, because without it they're not receiving any grace at all.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.720]   The extreme opposite of that of course is the Quaker position and also that of the Salvation
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.400]   Army which says that they're not necessary at all.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.800]   They just don't do them and they're not interested.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:24.760]   But again you see that is not the Reformed position, the Protestant position.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:32.320]   Our position is this, that we believe in these sacraments because they were instituted by
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.600]   and commended by the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:46.040]   It is his commandment and we do it out of obedience to his commandment.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:51.560]   Not only that, we see very clearly in the New Testament that the apostles themselves
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.680]   obeyed that commandment.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:59.640]   And our position is that we are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.240]   But we hasten to add this.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:09.840]   They are not essential and we take the bread and the wine not because we believe it is
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:16.240]   essential, but because it has been commended and because it is one of the means of grace
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.120]   ordained by the Lord himself.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.760]   We say it's not essential for this reason, that by our own definition they don't add
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.440]   anything to the word.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.800]   There is nothing additional in the sacraments.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.320]   They simply tell us the same thing in a different way, like the man giving the ring again.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.800]   He's not adding any love to that young lady, but he's telling it in a different way and
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:49.200]   in a way which is visible and symbolical and which therefore does represent to her something
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.400]   that his actual words did not represent.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.120]   But still he's not adding to it.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.520]   And in the sacraments we don't add to the truth of the word.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:05.680]   There is no peculiar exceptional grace conveyed by the sacraments and only by the sacraments.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.680]   And that is why it has always been the traditional teaching again that the sacrament and the
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.960]   word should never be separated.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.600]   In other words, that the sacraments should always be in connection with the preaching
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.800]   of the word.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:25.320]   They should never be a service only to meet at the communion table or a service only for
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.240]   a baptism.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.200]   There must be a full church service and the word must be preached in order that we may
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:38.720]   safeguard ourselves from that grievous danger of all Catholicism of regarding a sacrament
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:47.320]   as not only something in and of itself, but also as regarding it as the supreme means
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.840]   of receiving grace.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   It isn't.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:56.240]   Indeed, I don't hesitate to take my stand with the great Protestant fathers who asserted
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:03.080]   this, that it is the word that comes first and foremost, the preaching of the word.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:09.160]   The sacraments are confirmations, they are additions in the sense that they simply put
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:14.320]   it in a different way visually and in that special manner I've been emphasizing, but
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.520]   they don't add to it.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:21.120]   The truth comes, the grace comes primarily by the word.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:30.000]   So that you see it is essential that anybody who is to derive any benefit from the sacrament
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.720]   must be a man of faith.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:40.400]   Without faith in the recipient there is no value whatsoever in baptism or in the Lord's
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:49.520]   Supper because obviously the whole definition rests upon that idea.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:56.000]   It is because she already knows this love of this person that that woman values that
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.500]   ring.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.720]   It is confirmation of faith.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.680]   It's something that seals the faith so that we emphasize not only the preaching of the
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:14.680]   word, but the absolute necessity of faith in the recipient.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.080]   Now the Roman Catholic is not interested in the faith of the recipient.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.000]   The grace is in the sacrament and it is therefore something that must enter into anybody who
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   takes it.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.640]   Whatever his condition may be, he can't help himself.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.000]   It acts in and of itself.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.080]   But from our standpoint, faith is essential and there is no value whatsoever in anybody
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.640]   coming to the communion table and taking the bread and the wine if they don't come with
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.520]   faith they've done nothing.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.680]   And they're no different and no better than they were before.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.760]   But if they come in true faith and realize that God has instituted that for that special
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.360]   purpose, well then they ought to be conscious of receiving grace, not through the bread
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.800]   and wine as such, but through the realization that God is telling them something through
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:12.640]   the bread and wine which he's chosen to say in that way, like the ring on the finger.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.760]   Well now that brings me to the last point that I'm anxious to discuss this evening,
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.480]   which is this.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.200]   How many sacraments are there?
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   This needn't detain us.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.640]   In the case again of the Catholics, they recognize seven.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.400]   It may be of interest to you to know what the seven are.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:43.440]   Evangelism, confirmation, the Lord's Supper, penance, extreme unction, orders, that's
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:50.240]   to say when a man is ordained as deacon or priest or bishop or whatever else it may be,
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:57.400]   orders, that's a sacrament in the Catholic conception, and finally marriage.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.160]   Marriage is a sacrament according to their teaching.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.840]   Hence you see the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church and in general the Church of England
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.520]   to the whole question of divorce.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   And it determines not only their general attitude towards divorce, but in particular it controls
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:23.240]   their position with regard to the remarriage of the so-called innocent party to a divorce.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.960]   You are aware that there's great controversy about this at the present time.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:33.040]   The Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church will not remarry even an innocent party
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.480]   in a divorce.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.080]   And the reason for that is that their marriage is a sacrament.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.280]   That's their reason for it.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   So they recognize those seven sacraments.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:51.740]   But again I have to say that that is not the Protestant position.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:57.880]   The traditional Protestant position is to recognize two sacraments only, and they are
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:03.280]   of course baptism and the Lord's Supper.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:11.520]   And the reason for that is simply this, that they are the only two that were instituted
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:18.440]   by the Lord himself and which are commanded by the Lord himself.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:25.380]   And there is obviously, as you go through your scriptures, and I speak very deliberately
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:33.960]   and advisedly, no evidence whatsoever for regarding the other five as what are called
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.320]   sacraments.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:42.520]   That was a teaching that crept into the Church in later centuries as the power of the priest
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:49.020]   and this sacramentarian idea developed, quite logical once you make the first false step.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:53.800]   But they all came in in that way, and they're not based, even the Roman Church doesn't
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.960]   pretend that they can bring scriptural evidence.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.200]   It's this further teaching of the Church which they claim to be inspired and equally
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.120]   inspired with the scriptures.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:11.800]   Well now there we've been considering this question of the sacraments in general.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.640]   And I see that my time once more has gone.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:20.400]   But perhaps in expending the amount of time I have tonight on this general question of
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:27.020]   the sacraments, I may be saving you and myself a certain amount of time when we come to consider
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:31.560]   baptism and the Lord's Supper in detail.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:41.160]   The great and important thing is to understand this principle, this emphasis upon the sealing,
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.560]   so that when we come to consider the two, well we shall then just simply have to consider
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:54.560]   what exactly is sealed and how exactly it is sealed.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.340]   But I do trust that we are clear about this great central idea.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:06.920]   Remember that the basis of it all is the eleventh verse in the fourth chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.240]   to the Romans.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:16.840]   And can we part from one another tonight without feeling a sense of thanksgiving and of praise
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:28.840]   in our hearts to God for having ordered and decreed and instituted these aids to our faith?
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:37.120]   It is God in his own infinite condescension who has stooped to our weakness.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.720]   He has provided something for the eye as well as for the ear.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:49.000]   These are means of grace appointed by God, so that we have no excuse if we fail, if we
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.720]   say we can't listen to a sermon that's longer than twenty minutes, that we really
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.120]   can't do it, and that perhaps a quarter of an hour is more than we can in this enlightened
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.120]   age.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:04.280]   If we say that it's too much to try and take in truth in that way, well here it is.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:15.120]   But do we not also recognize this extraordinary foreknowledge of God?
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.840]   How often has it happened in the history of the Church that when the men who are privileged
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:29.000]   to be standing in pulpits were not preaching the truth and the evangelical faith, but were
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.120]   preaching a kind of humanism or a morality or even preaching the Church or something
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:40.240]   else, how often has it happened that when the pulpit had forsaken its privilege and
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:48.960]   its duty and its task, by the other method, by the visual method, the gospel was still
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.880]   being proclaimed for those who had any understanding.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:59.240]   And often it has happened, therefore, that the hungry sheep, to use Milton's word,
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:07.400]   who have come and have not been fed by the word preached, have been able to find it in
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:14.160]   the bread or in the wine or in the water in baptism, and have been reminded through their
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:19.520]   understanding of the scriptures that God can speak in that way as well as in this other
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.520]   way.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:26.600]   So we marvel again not only at the kindness and the condescension of God who spooks to
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:36.320]   our weakness, mighty as he is, but his extraordinary provision for guaranteeing that the truth
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:47.040]   should always be proclaimed through the Church and often by men who, in their words, denied
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:53.200]   what they were actually enacting in administering the sacraments.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   The ways of God are truly beyond our understanding, but they are ever perfect.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.240]   Praise be unto God.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
