[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I should like to express my gratitude for the kind words of welcome extended to me,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and to say how glad I am to be here this afternoon and being given an opportunity of expounding to you the word of God.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   When my friend, the Reverend Harry Sutton, told me of the way in which he was quite convinced
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   that God was visiting you good people who live in this immediate area,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   I immediately expressed my interest.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   He knew that when he reported the matter to me,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and I told him that I would be very privileged to share something in the blessing
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   that God was giving to his faithful people in this place.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And so I am here this afternoon.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And I trust that the prayers that have been offered, not only this afternoon,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   but I hear during the whole of this week which is ending today,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   will be richly answered, indeed answered, above all that we can hope or think.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And then, of course, we shall all be greatly and truly blessed.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Now I'd like to call attention this afternoon to that portion of scripture that has been read to us
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 8,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   calling attention particularly to the fourth verse, verse number 4,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   in the eighth chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   "Therefore, they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word."
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Now this eighth chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles is a particularly interesting chapter
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   because it records a kind of new departure in the life of the early, the infant Christian church.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Up until this point, the church had been confined to the city of Jerusalem.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   That, of course, was inevitable because the Holy Spirit had descended on those people
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And so the church started there.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And until this point, it had been virtually confined to the city of Jerusalem.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But here, we begin to read about the church spreading,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   going outside the city into Judea and into Samaria,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and ultimately to the ultimate parts of the earth.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   This, of course, was nothing but a fulfillment of the prophecy that was made by our Lord himself,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   as it's recorded in the first chapter of this Book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   in the eighth verse where he said to the apostles,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   "But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and unto the uttermost part of the earth."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Now, here, we get the beginning of the fulfillment of that prediction.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And that's what makes this of such great interest, it seems to me, in the history of the church,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   and especially what makes it of interest to us in our present circumstances as Christian people.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   For I feel that once more we are going back to these times that are recorded here in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   The Christians were a very small group of people, as you know.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   They were really just a handful of people.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And there surrounding them were many that were bitterly opposed to them.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   The Jews, they'd hated our Lord and were mainly responsible for his crucifixion.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And the Gentiles, the Romans and others, were all opposed to the Gospel.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So here you see the church, a small body of people, in an atmosphere that was very inimical to them.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Much persecution and opposition and so on.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And yet, what we are told here is of how the Gospel spread and flourished and how the church was extended.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Now, this, I say surely, is something that speaks to us in a very direct and immediate manner at the present time.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   We are back once more in this same position.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   We are not Christian people, we are just a handful, as it were, in a pagan society.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   This is not a Christian country. It's a pagan country.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   We are surrounded by pagans and by religions that are opposed to the pure Gospel, the real message of the Christian church.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And this is true of the whole world.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So the great thing that should be of interest and concern to us is this.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   How does the Gospel spread?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Is there any message that can give us encouragement and hope at this present time?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Well, now, it's because I believe this passage speaks very directly in that way to us that I'm directing your attention to it.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   For here we are told how it happened at the beginning.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And I'm one of those who holds very strongly that what happened at the beginning is what has always happened in every period of reformation and of revival.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And I am certain it is the thing that's going to happen once more.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   God grant that it may be in this present century.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   God doesn't vary his methods. And what happened at the beginning is what has always happened, I say, in the great periods in the history of the church.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And this is what we must look forward to once more.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Well, now, how did the Gospel spread at the beginning with almost everything against it?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And here we are given the answer.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   There were three main factors.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The first was the preaching of the apostles.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   We've had an account of that in the previous chapters.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   That must always come first.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Nothing can ever replace preaching.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It is God's chosen method.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   He raises up men. He gives them abilities and powers. He gives them the message.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   He puts his spirit upon them.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   That's how it's always happened. I could prove this to you so easily from history.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Think of 200 years ago, the Methodist awakening. It was preaching.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Whitefield and the Westlers. Great preaching.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   When preaching had become outmoded and unpopular, God raised up preachers again.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And this is what he's always done.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And this is the greatest need of all today. All this nonsense about dialogue and discussion.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's a sheer waste of time. It never comes to anything.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's entertainment and it has no results.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   The great need today, as always, is mighty apostolic preaching.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   That comes first.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   But you notice it wasn't the only factor in the spread of the church and in the extension of the kingdom of God.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   There was a second factor.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And this to me is the most interesting and the most encouraging one.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I wonder if you've ever noticed it as you've read this chapter.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   What was the second great factor in the spread of the gospel and the extension of the church?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   The answer is that it was persecution.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   This is the most amazing thing.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   At that time, we are told in the first verse, there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Therefore, they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Now, this is to me one of the most encouraging things in the whole of the New Testament, and especially at a time like this.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So many people, Christian people, I find are discouraged by persecution.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And it's very natural, I suppose.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   But you know, it's quite wrong.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   God has often used persecution to extend his kingdom.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   This is a remarkable principle that runs right through the Bible.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Let me give you one or two hurried illustrations of it.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You all remember the story of Joseph, the son of Jacob and his brethren.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And you remember how these brethren of Joseph were very jealous of him because of his unusual and exceptional abilities and characteristics.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And they became so jealous of him that they plotted at first to kill him.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Then at the entreaties of one of them, they decided not to kill him but to sell him as a slave.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And they sold him.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And he was carried down, you remember, to Egypt.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But then he was a man of God.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And God eventually raised him up to be the chief man in Egypt immediately under the pharaoh himself.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And you remember the great story of the famine and so on.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And how eventually the brothers of Joseph had to go down to buy corn in Egypt because of this terrible famine.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And you remember how at first they didn't recognize Joseph and he didn't reveal his identity.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   But how after a while he decided to do so.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And he made known to them the fact that he was Joseph, their brother.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And you remember their immediate reaction.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   They thought he'd kill them immediately.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   They knew they deserved it.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   That's what they'd proposed to do with him.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   But Joseph reassures them immediately.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And he tells them, you remember, a remarkable thing.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   He said, "You know, it wasn't you who sent me down to Egypt.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   It was God, not you.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   They had actually sold him, of course.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Oh, yes, but it was the purpose of God.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   God had used even the malignity and the jealousy of the brethren of Joseph to further his own purpose,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   to safeguard the future of his people.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And you see, God had overruled all the evil intentions of these cruel men.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Now, there's an Old Testament example of this principle.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   But let me give you another one from the New Testament.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   You remember what the Apostle Paul tells us in his epistle to the Philippians?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   He writes to these Philippians from jail, and he knows that they're very worried about him.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   This great man, this great leader, was ill and in prison.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Some said that he was dying, and they all began to wonder what they could do without him.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And they were terribly worried about this imprisonment.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   But Paul writes to them, and in the first chapter he puts it like this, beginning at verse 12.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   "But I would that you should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   have fallen out rather into the furtherance of the gospel,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And many of the brethren of the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Some indeed preach Christ, even of envy and of strife,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   and some also of goodwill, etc.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   But the point, you see, that he makes is this,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   that what had happened unto him has happened rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Please forgive me, my friends. I've had a terrible cold.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It was very doubtful a day or two ago that I'd be here at all.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   But we shall do our best, and I trust that the prayers of the friends here,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   even for my health, shall be answered."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   The point I'm making is this,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   that persecution has often been used by God to further his own purposes.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Even the imprisonment of Paul opens up the possibility of the presentation of the gospel in the imperial palace.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   In other words, for me to sum it up, we can put it like this, as the psalmist puts it so perfectly,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   "Verily, the wrath of men shall praise thee."
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   So that we needn't be discouraged or alarmed by persecution,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   God can overrule it all.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   These powers that persecute the church are very blind and very foolish.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And they forget that everything is under the hand of God.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Everything is under his almighty power.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   So here we find in this eighth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   that God actually used this senseless persecution of these people
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   to spread the confines of his kingdom and to make the gospel known to an increasing number of people.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Now let's not forget this, therefore.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And as you read the history of the church again, you will find that this has happened so frequently.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But that brings me to the third great factor in the spread of the gospel and the extension of the kingdom here in this first century.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   What was that?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Well, it was, of course, the thing that is emphasized in this fourth verse,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   the witness and the testimony of these people, these ordinary members of the Christian church.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   "Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Who were they?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Well, we've already been told.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   They were the members of the church in Jerusalem apart from the apostles.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Did you notice that interesting detail that we were given there in that first verse?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   "Therefore they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   For some extraordinary reason, the apostles were allowed to remain in Jerusalem.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   So the people who were scattered abroad were the members of the church.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And what we are told here is that they who were thus scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And this was the particular means that was used by God at this point in the extension of his kingdom,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   the extension of his church, and the spreading of the good news of salvation.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Now, here again is something that has happened so often in the history of the church.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And I want to remind you very hurriedly of it on this occasion.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Because to me it's a most concerning, most comforting, and most interesting fact.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I have already reminded you that the preaching of the apostles must come first.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   We must always give that the first priority.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   But then there is this other factor, and this also has its vital and important place.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And this is particularly important for us at this present time.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Now, I see this has happened so often in the previous history of the church.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And I think we need to be familiar with these things at a time such as this present time.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Have you read the stories of the centuries concerning the Christian church?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And have you noticed how God has used so frequently not the great leaders, not the apostles,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   but these ordinary church members as he did on this occasion?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Let me give you one or two illustrations.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Take, for instance, what happened even before the Protestant Reformation.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   You know, before that great reformation of the 16th century, God had been doing some amazing things through some quite unknown people.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Have you ever read the story of the people known as the Waldensians in northern Italy?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I'm advocating the reading of history. Read the history of the church, my friends.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   It's the greatest encouragement you will ever get next to the Bible itself.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Read about the Waldensians. What were they?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Well, now, here were people, you see, living in northern Italy, Roman Catholics,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   under the blight and the darkness of Roman Catholic teaching.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   It always keeps people in the dark. And there they were in this utter darkness.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   But the Spirit of God began to deal with them.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   There was one leader amongst them, Peter Waldo. It's the only name that we have from these people.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   That's why they're called Waldensians.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But the vast bulk of them were quite unknown people. We don't even know their names.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   What happened? Well, you see, these people were enlightened by the Spirit.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   They began to read the Scriptures. They began to see the fallacy of the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And they began to meet together in little groups in their homes and houses to study the Scriptures and to pray together.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Then, as they were persecuted, they'd go up to the mountains, and they met in the caves and in various other places.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And thus they went on and became quite a powerful movement, even before the Protestant Reformation.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   At the same time, there were people in Bohemia and Moravia and in what we now call Holland and Belgium,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   known as the Brethren of the Common Life. These again were ordinary people. We don't know their names.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   But again, they'd been enlightened by the Spirit. They'd been awakened to the truth.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And they met together in little companies. And thus they studied the Word of God together, and they prayed,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and they talked to one another, and it became quite a powerful movement again.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Indeed, it made way for the work of Martin Luther and others in the 16th century.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   And I could keep you at great length to read the story of early Protestantism in this country.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Again, there were great leaders, I know. But there were masses of ordinary people.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And thus it spread. Read of the early history of the Puritans. Read the history of early Methodism.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Just a handful of great leaders, but the ordinary people, awakened, convicted, born again,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and they'd meet together in their classes and in their little meetings.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   That's how it spread. In spite of intense persecution. In spite of bitter opposition.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Well, now you see, this is a principle that you find running through the whole history of the Church.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Exactly as it was in operation here in these very earliest days.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   The witness and the testimony of the common people.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   So, my dear friends, let us take courage from these things.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Whatever the leaders of the Churches may be doing, and we know what they are doing,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   let's not waste our time concerning that.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Our business is to see that we are functioning as these early Christians suffered and went everywhere preaching the Word.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   God deigns to use us as his instruments in the extension of his kingdom.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   So the matter that lies before us is this. What did they do?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And the answer we are given is this. They went everywhere preaching the Word.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Now I want to emphasize certain things concerning this.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Let me emphasize first of all the fact that they preached the Word.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Why do I emphasize that? Well, I think this is of tremendous importance.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   You see, what we are told about these people is that they went everywhere not simply talking about themselves.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   They probably did that in a measure as I'm going to show you.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   But the point is they didn't just go everywhere giving their testimony or telling people about themselves and what had happened to them.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   The Scriptures are very particular and they're very careful.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   They remind us that they went everywhere preaching the Word.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Why do I emphasize this? Well, for this very important reason.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   If we don't do the same as these people but simply talk about ourselves and our experiences,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   we shall not be able to withstand the opposition to the Christian faith at the present time from the various cults that are around and about us.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   You're all familiar with these cults.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   You're seated in your home on a Saturday afternoon and suddenly somebody knocks at the door.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And you go to the door and there you may see two young men.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   They're not at a football match. No, no.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   They're full of zeal and enthusiasm and they want to talk to you about the Scriptures, about the Bible.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   They want to sell you books. They belong to a particular cult.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Now, what do they talk about?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Well, they talk about their marvelous experience.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   You say, "Why are young men like you doing something like this on a Saturday afternoon instead of being in a football match?"
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Well, they'll say, "It's because of the wonderful experience we've had since we've taken up this belief."
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   You're familiar with them, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Christian scientists and many others.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Now, these people rarely base their whole position upon certain experiences and they're always talking about them.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   So if you and I just talk about experiences, we have no real answer to these cults that are so flourishing around and about us at this present time.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   You see, if you say, "Ah, well, but you know, I've had a marvelous experience. My life has been changed."
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   They'll say exactly the same thing.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And if they do say the same thing, you say, "Well, you know, I used to be a great warrior. I now never worry about anything at all."
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Exactly that was my position as the Christian scientist.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   You talk about illnesses, having been cured, they can repeat it.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Almost every case you mention, they can duplicate it.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And thus, you see, if we stop at the realm of experience and talk about ourselves only, we rarely have no answer to these people.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   So we must observe this particular emphasis.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   They went everywhere preaching the Word.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   This is the thing that marks us off from all the cults.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Of course, we have experiences. Thank God for them.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   The Christian is a man who has an experience.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   If he hasn't, he's not a Christian.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   But it isn't merely a matter of experience.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Because, as I say, not only the cults, but psychology and various other things can give you these experiences.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   But the business of the Christian is to be preaching the Word.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Well, now, what does this mean?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And here again is something very important.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   We are told that these people who were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the Word.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   What did they do?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And it's the case, isn't it, that the moment I mention this word "preaching," you immediately and instinctively think of what I'm trying to do at the present time.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   I've come here to preach the Word.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I'm standing on a platform.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   It's like entering into a pulpit.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   That's our idea, isn't it, of preaching.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   But, you know, that isn't what these people did.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And I can prove this to you.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   It's not the truth to say that they all entered into pulpits and began to preach in this manner.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   How can I prove that?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Well, I prove that by taking this verse 4 with verse 5.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   In verse 5, we read, "Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them."
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Now, in this authorized translation, it looks as if Philip did exactly the same thing as these other people.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   But he didn't.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   What he did was something different.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And if you look up the original, you'll find two different words are used.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   They're both translated here by "preaching."
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   What's the difference?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Well, in the case of Philip in verse 5, he did what I'm trying to do now.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   It was an act of proclamation.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   It was a declaration.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   He was an evangelist sent forth by the church to make this great proclamation, this announcement of the truth.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   In that particular manner, a heralding of the gospel of salvation.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   What about the people in verse 4?
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Well, this is most interesting.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   A different word.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   What did they do?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Well, they didn't herald.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   They didn't proclaim.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   What did they do?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Well, they talked.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   I rather like the translation that someone has suggested, which puts it like this.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   "Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere, gossiping the word."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Gossiping the word.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Not standing up and delivering an address or an oration.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   No, rather they went into these people's homes.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   These people very kindly took them in.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   They'd been persecuted.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   They'd had to flee for their lives.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   They'd had to leave everything back in Jerusalem.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And these kind people took them into their homes and houses.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And they began to talk together.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And in the conversation, these Christians were careful always to introduce this word.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   As they were gossiping about the weather and about the injustice of the taxes of the Roman Empire,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   which had conquered their country and all these various other things,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   the Christians introduced the word.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   They gossiped it.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Now, this is what we are all called upon to do.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   It's no longer the custom for people to go to places of worship on Sunday.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Very well.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   That makes the responsibility of every individual church member altogether greater.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   You meet with people.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   You talk to them across the garden wall.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   You go into one another's houses.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   You meet in the mart or in the fair or in the factory.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Or as you're walking along the road and people begin to talk about what's happening,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   the floating of the pound, Vietnam, South Africa, and so on.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Now, then, our business is to introduce this word, to gossip the word.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   This is what they did.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And this, I say, is what we are called upon to do.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   But it must be the word.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Not our experiences, not ourselves primarily, but first and foremost, the word.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   What else does this tell us?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Well, it tells us, doesn't it, that this word is something very definite.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   It is the word.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   These people all said the same thing.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   They all spoke and gossiped the same thing.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   The word.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   What does this mean?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Well, I say the deduction I draw from it is this.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   That the Christian message is a very definite message.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And I want to emphasize this at the present time.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You know, the common idea today is this.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   That you can't really define the Christian message.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   That all that matters is that we should be Christians, that we all should be out to do good.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   And they say, you know, the trouble in the past has been that our forefathers were so careful to define things,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   they had their theology and their doctrines, and all that was nonsense.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   It was arrogant.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   They said this is right and that's wrong.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   They say you can't do that.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Truth is much too big for that.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Truth is something so marvelous that you can't put it in definitions.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   So that as long as a man vaguely somehow in any way calls himself a Christian, that's all right.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And therefore the Christian message is some vague message about brotherhood and friendship and doing good.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Ah, the great word today is community.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   You must have heard people talking recently on the television, the business of the church is to promote community.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Just make us all be happy together and nice and friendly and so on.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Well, now, that you see is a contradiction of what we are told here.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   They went everywhere preaching the word.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   The word is something that you can define.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And of course the Christian church in all our great periods has defined it.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   You'll get definitions in the New Testament.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   You'll find the apostle Paul saying,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   "Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David is raised from the dead according to my gospel."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   It's the only gospel.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   The other is wrong.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   You remember him saying to the Galatians,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Let him be accursed."
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   This is an intolerant gospel.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   It's clear. It's definite.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   It is the faith once and forever delivered to the saints.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And so you see, this is what makes the thing so laughable.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   So many of these people who say you can't define the Christian message,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   they go to their churches every Sunday morning,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   and at a given point in the service they all get up and they recite together what is called the Apostles' Creed.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   What's that?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   It's a definition of Christianity, a definition of the faith.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Then they have their Nicene Creed or their Athanasian Creed.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   What are these?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Definitions of Christianity.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   You see, there were false teachers in the early church,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   and some of them were denying vital doctrines.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   So the Spirit of God led these men together in their great councils,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   and they laid down what was true and what was not true.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   They defined heresy and they punished heretics.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   They drove them out of the church.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   They said, "These men are denying the gospel."
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   And they must be got rid of.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Now, this is the Word.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   So you see, this modern idea of world congress of faiths,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   everybody believing anything you like as long as you want to call yourself a Christian,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   it's a denial of the whole of the Scripture.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   This is a particular message.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   It's a definite message.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And unless we know what this message is,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   surely we have no right to call ourselves Christians.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   They went everywhere preaching the Word,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   the given particular Word.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   I draw that deduction, and then I draw another one,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   which is that Christianity, the message of the Christian gospel,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   is a message that is essentially simple.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   What I mean is this.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I've emphasized the fact that these people were not the apostles.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   They were the ordinary members of the church.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Yes, but they were able to speak and to gossip the Word.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   They had sufficient understanding to do so.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And they did so.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And here again is something that one must emphasize.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   A Christian is a man who knows what he believes,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   and he knows in whom he has believed.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Do you remember the apostle Peter putting this?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   He again writes to unknown Christians,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and he says, "You must be ready at all times
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   to give a reason for the hope that is in you."
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   In other words, you don't merely sit down with people
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   and give them your experience.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   You can tell them why you've had it,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and you can show them the difference between the cults and what you've got.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You can state the truth to them.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   You can give expression to the faith.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Now, isn't this again important at the present time?
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   You know, I'm not surprised that the message of the people
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   are outside the Christian church.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Sometimes I have an opportunity and leisure
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   to listen to some of these great authorities
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   speaking on the television and elsewhere about the Christian faith,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   and you hear them bringing out these great terms--
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   existentialism and these marvelous terms.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   We don't know what they're talking about.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   They don't know themselves.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   But the common people, they say,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   "If this is Christianity, I'm not interested in it."
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   The idea has got abroad that you must be some great philosopher
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   or a great scientist, and you ma-bandy these magical terms about,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   and that that's Christianity.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   My dear friends, this one text is enough to give the lie to that once and forever.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   You were ordinary people,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   and yet they could give expression to this faith, to this gospel.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   They went everywhere preaching the word.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   But let me be fair.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   While I say that the gospel is essentially simple,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I must also add that at the same time the gospel is so great,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   so marvelous, so glorious,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   that the greatest intellect in the world cannot comprehend it.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   It's the mystery of God, the wisdom of God,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   which none of the princes of this world knew.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   This message of ours is such that the simplest Christian can give expression to it,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   and yet the mightiest philosopher or scientist can't understand it.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   They called it foolishness at the beginning.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   They're still saying it's folly.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   It doesn't make the slightest difference.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   It is the word.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   What is this word?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Well, I mustn't keep you.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   You're familiar with it. It's the message of the New Testament.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   What did these apostles preach?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   The apostles preached Jesus Christ and Him crucified,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   These are the great centralities of the faith.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   I may refer to them on a subsequent occasion.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   But this is the word, this faith once and forever delivered to the saints.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   There must be no uncertainty about the person of our Lord or about His work.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   This is the message. That's all these people knew.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   This is what they'd been told.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   This is what had led to their great experience.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And therefore this is what they talked about.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   They went everywhere preaching the word.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   But I want to close on this note.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Why did they do this?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Haven't you been surprised as you've read this verse?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Here are people who because of persecution have had to escape for their lives.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   They've had to leave everything. They've lost everything.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   And they're fugitives and wanderers.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And they arrive in Judea and in Samaria and other parts.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And these kind people took them in, into their homes.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And immediately they began to talk about this word.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Isn't this surprising?
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   I wonder whether we would do the same.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   You know I have a suspicion that some of us would argue like this.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   We'd say, "Well, now, we must be careful.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   We've had to leave everything. We've lost everything.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Because we talk too much.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   We were always talking about this gospel and what it's done to us.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And here we are in trouble.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   We're having another start, another opportunity.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   What shall we do?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Well, now, we must use a little common sense this time and a little wisdom.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   We mustn't talk so much about it.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Of course, we can have our private devotions and so on.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But we mustn't parade the thing. We mustn't talk so much about it.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   We must keep quiet and use a little worldly wisdom.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Many are doing that today.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   But you know these early Christians did the exact opposite.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Though they'd been persecuted and had left everything and lost everything,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   wherever they went, they immediately began to talk about this word.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Why did they do this? What made them do this, you think?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   I don't think it's difficult to answer the question.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   They did it, of course, because of what this word had done for them.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   These people were people who had been born again.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   They were new people in Christ Jesus.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   They knew that it was true of them to say that if any man be in Christ,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   he's a new creature. All things are passed away.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Behold, all things have become new. And this had happened to them.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   And they were partakers of a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Their view of everything had been changed.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Persecution, possessions, even death itself, everything had been changed.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   And so, you see, because of this new life and this new joy and happiness
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   that had come to them, they felt they'd got to tell everybody about it.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   It was like a kind of dynamo, working in them and urging them and driving them on.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Or let me put it like this to you.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   They went everywhere talking about this word because, as we put it,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   they were full of it.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   You know, people always talk about what they're interested in.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Now, it's not difficult to imagine what's going to be the conversation
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   in most homes in this country tonight.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I can tell you now, it'll be about one of two things.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   It'll either be about the test match or about some football match.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Everybody will be talking about this. Why? That's what they're interested in.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   It's the big thing in their lives. It's uppermost in their minds.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   And whatever is uppermost in our minds is the thing that we always talk about.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   We wait for an opportunity, a lull in the conversation,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   and we immediately bring it in.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   So this is natural to human nature. It worked in these people.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   They were full of this thing.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   This was the biggest thing to them in the whole world.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   The loss of home and possession, parting perhaps from relatives,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   it was all secondary. This was the big thing.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   This amazing thing that God had so loved the world
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   that he'd sent his only begotten son into it,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   and that he'd actually died, that they might be redeemed.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   They had to speak about it. They were full of this thing.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   And they couldn't refrain.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   And then I think there was another thing.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   They wanted to praise the name of their great and glorious savior.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   This again is something quite natural, isn't it?
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   If somebody's done you a very great favor,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   or has been the means of some great blessing to you,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   you'll want everybody to think highly of that person.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   You'll want everybody to talk to him and to go to him.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   This happens with doctors.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   You've been to a doctor, he's done his best, and couldn't help you,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   and you're no better, and you go to another, and on and on.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   You've been to the round of so many. At last, you meet a doctor,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   he suddenly understands what's the matter with you, gives you a prescription,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   you get your medicine, and you're perfectly well.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Now, I'll guarantee that you won't be long in any company
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   before you'll begin to be talking about this man,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   this wonderful doctor who understood your case and who cured you.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   It's all right.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   And these people were animated by the same kind of motive.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   They realized that the blessed son of God
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   had thrown aside for the time being
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   the signs and the marks of his eternal glory,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   and had humbled himself,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   and had come in the form of a servant and in the likeness of sinful flesh,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   and had even died that cruel death on the cross
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   that they might be redeemed and saved and become the sons of God,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   why, they wanted to praise him.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   And a Christian is a man who wants to praise his God.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   He says, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   "my great Redeemer's praise."
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   But I imagine that the ultimate reason
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   why these people went everywhere preaching the word was this--
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   that they saw the need of these people with whom they were now living.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Can't you picture the thing?
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Here they are, they've had to flee from Jerusalem.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   They've lost everything.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   But these kind people have opened their doors to them,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   and they've invited them into their homes,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   sharing their food and shelter with them.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   And they hadn't been there long before they realized
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   that these poor people were still living in utter darkness.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   You know, you can be very kind and yet live in utter darkness.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   The average person is very kind,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   and when they see somebody in need, they'll do anything they can to help.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   That doesn't mean they're Christians, you know.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   You don't have to be a Christian to be nice and to be kind
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   and to be friendly and hospitable. No, no.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   But these Christians living amongst them,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   they could see that they were in gross darkness,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   that they were the slaves of the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   They didn't realize they'd got a soul.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   They didn't realize that they've got to die and stand before God in the judgment.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   They knew nothing about God's great act in Jesus Christ.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   They were in gross darkness.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And these Christian people, they felt sorry for them,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   and especially because of their great kindness to them.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   How could they repay them?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Well, the obvious way to repay them was to tell them about this gospel,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   to speak this word to them, to awaken them to their lost condition,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   to show them the danger to their souls,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   to tell them of God's love in Christ.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   How could they refrain? The need of the people.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And, my dear friends, doesn't this obtain at the present time?
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   "Men die in darkness at thy side, without a hope to cheer the tomb.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Take up the torch and wave it wide."
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   This is the command to us at this present time.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Men and women round and about us, they're nice and kind and friendly,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   but they don't know they've got a soul.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   They know nothing about God.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   They know nothing about eternity.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   They know nothing about the judgment.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   And it's coming to all.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   How can we remain silent?
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   This is the thing that animated these early Christians.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And yet, you know, I have a feeling that I haven't said the most important thing of all,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   and I close with it.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   It is this.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   What made these people do this?
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   I ask you again, imagine the circumstances, conjure up the picture.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Here they are in these strange homes, with these strange people,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   and they feel they must talk about this word.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Do we feel like that?
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Do we know anything about this constraint, this compulsion,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   at the risk again of being persecuted and turned out and perhaps even perhaps being put to death?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   These early Christians, they talked about it, as the early Methodists did
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   and as the early--everybody does it and did it throughout the centuries.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   What is it that makes people do this?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Well, we've been told it several times in the early chapters of this book.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   The apostles have put it like this, "We cannot but speak."
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Or as Paul puts it, "The love of Christ constraineth me."
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   "Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel."
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   What is this?
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Do you know, my friends, there's only one answer to this.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   It is to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Did you notice the subsequent reading?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   How Philip, having preached in Samaria, these people believed his preaching,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   became Christians and he baptized them, and they were added to the church.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   But we are told that though they believed and had been baptized,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   they still had not received this baptism with the Spirit.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   And Peter and John had to go down from Jerusalem in order to preach to them and pray over them.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And then they received the Holy Ghost.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   And again, as you read the New Testament and the subsequent history of the church,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   you'll find that this constantly recurs.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   You can be a good Christian, you can believe the Orthodox faith,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   you can be living a Christian life, and yet you don't feel this compulsion, this must,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   this "therefore"-- "Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word."
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   This compulsion--what is it? What makes a man do that?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   There's only one answer. It is the fire of the Holy Ghost.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Any man who is filled with the Spirit, he always acts like this.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Our Lord, you see, had prophesied this.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   He said, "Stay where you are until you have received power from on high,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   and then you shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in Judea, Samaria,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   and the uttermost parts of the earth."
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Nothing makes Christians witnesses but this fullness, this power of the Spirit.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   It's what turned a Peter, who to save his skin denied his Lord,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   into a bold witness that could defy the Sanhedrin,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   was ready to die rather than fail to testify about this Gospel.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   It's the fire of the Holy Ghost. It's a baptism with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   It's a power, and it's a power for witness.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And I wonder, my dear friends, whether this isn't the thing that is lacking
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   above everything else amongst us at this present time.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   I've urged the importance of orthodoxy.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I've said the faith, the word, is something concrete, definite,
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   that can be defined and contrasted with error.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Yes, but you can be orthodox and dead.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   You can be absolutely correct and yet have no effect,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   and not even feel that you've got to tell people.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   You can be satisfied with your reading and studying and your own enjoyment of it.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   What is this thing that makes people talk about it and tell everybody?
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Oh, it's the fire of the Holy Ghost.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   It's being filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Go back and read again the history of early Methodism.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   John Wesley had come to see the truth in March 1738,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   but he didn't begin to preach it as a flaming evangelist
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   until the incident in Aldersgate Street in London on the 24th of May 1738,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   and still more on January the 1st, 1739.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   The same is true of all these men.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   This is the great history and story of revivals,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   the Holy Ghost coming upon people.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Yes, they may have been Christian for years and have held to the true faith,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   but they have remained quiet, more or less useless.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   And what turns them into flaming witnesses
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   is to be filled with the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Well, now, that's how Christianity spread in the first century.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   That is how it has spread in all the other great periods
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   in the long story of the Christian church.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   We can be absolutely certain
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   that God has not suddenly forsaken His ancient and traditional method.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   We must know the Word.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   We must be certain of it.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   There must be no compromise about it.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   But even that isn't enough.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   We must be certain that we are filled with the Spirit of God.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   We've already prayed for that in our hymns.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   We must go on praying and continue to pray
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   until it has been answered in our lives.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Go back, I said, to your history,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   particularly in this part of the country.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   I've mentioned the Methodist fathers,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   but I could equally well mention those men who met on Mo Cop.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   In a subsequent generation,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   these men who felt that early Methodism had lost something
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   and that the fire and the spirit of burning, as they called it, had gone,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   and who sought it again and who received it--
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   William Close, Hugh Bourne, and others,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   the originators of primitive Methodism, as it was called.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   This is how it's happened throughout the running centuries,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   and, Christian people, this is the point to which you and I must return.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   It doesn't matter who we are.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   It doesn't matter that the world may never have heard of us.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   It doesn't matter at all.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   These people, we don't know their names, but they were scattered abroad.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   They were persecuted, and they went everywhere preaching the word.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Why? Well, because they knew it and because they felt they had to.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   The spirit that was in them was burning, and they couldn't refrain.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   And they, like the great apostles, could say and did say,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   "We cannot but speak of the things which we have seen and heard,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   the things which we have experienced,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   the things for which, if needs be, we are ready to die,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   because it is the truth of God and of his Christ."
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   May God make of us such men and women in this evil age in which we live.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   If God be for us, who can be against us,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   let us make sure that we as individual Christian people
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   shall never be found wanting.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
