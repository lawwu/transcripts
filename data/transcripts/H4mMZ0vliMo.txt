[00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.760]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.940]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.520]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.760]   My guest today is Dr. Sergio Pasca.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.120]   Dr. Sergio Pasca is a professor of psychiatry
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.320]   and behavioral sciences,
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.160]   and the director
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.960]   of the Stanford Brain Organogenesis Program.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   During today's episode,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.200]   we discuss autism, schizophrenia,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   and human brain development generally,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.260]   both brain development during pregnancy,
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.500]   as well as during childhood,
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.420]   and leading all the way up to our third decade of life.
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.460]   During today's discussion,
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.760]   you will get the most up-to-date information
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   about autism and its treatments.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.560]   You'll learn why the prevalence of autism is rising,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.340]   the role that genes play in autism,
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.860]   and the novel treatments that Dr. Pasca is developing
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.120]   to treat what is called profound autism,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.500]   which are the most severe cases of autism.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.340]   Dr. Pasca is one of a small handful of researchers
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.460]   that pioneered the discovery and development
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.700]   of what are called organoids and assembloids,
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.480]   which are essentially human brain circuits
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.560]   derived from stem cells that form in a dish
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.380]   so that one can study them directly.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.000]   And while that might sound artificial,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.680]   today he explains why those organoids and assembloids
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.080]   are immensely powerful for understanding exactly what is wrong
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.640]   in psychiatric illnesses like profound autism,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.060]   schizophrenia, and other psychiatric challenges,
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.880]   and for developing cures.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.640]   So today you're going to learn a lot
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.420]   about human brain development and about stem cells,
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.360]   which is going to be important for anyone interested
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.900]   in how the brain wires up,
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.980]   how to treat various diseases of the brain,
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.260]   but also for anyone who is considering stem cell therapies.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.320]   As you'll soon learn,
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.340]   Sergio is an extraordinary scientist,
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.520]   but also an extraordinary teacher.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.820]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.100]   you'll have the latest information on stem cells,
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.460]   organoids, autism, and what is being done to cure autism,
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.500]   and other psychiatric conditions.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.340]   Before we begin,
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.060]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.680]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.740]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.240]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.840]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.960]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.340]   today's episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.520]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Sergio Pasca.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.380]   Dr. Sergio Pasca.
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.220]   - Welcome.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.760]   - Thank you, it's great to be here.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.360]   - We're old friends.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.180]   Shared a laboratory space years ago.
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.120]   We'll get back to that a little later.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   In the meantime, these days there's a ton of interest
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.240]   and I think misunderstanding about autism.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.020]   As soon as the topic of autism comes up,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.920]   immediately some people will say,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.300]   why are we trying to cure this thing?
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900]   I know autistic children and adults
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.620]   that are delightful people that lead functional lives.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.340]   They might be a little bit different
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.560]   or a lot different than other people,
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.080]   but why are we trying to quote unquote cure autism?
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.040]   And then other people will say,
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.820]   well, there are people with autism who need constant care,
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.140]   who will never live independently.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.820]   Tell us about autism, what this spectrum really is.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.460]   And then we'll talk about what your laboratory is doing to try
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.140]   and literally find cures for the most debilitating forms of autism.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.080]   - Well, autism is a complex condition.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   It's a spectrum, as you said.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.940]   In a way, you could say autism and neurodevelopmental disorders.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.640]   It's behaviorally defined.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.080]   There's no biomarker.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.540]   So in a way, it's a condition that is defined exclusively by observing behavior,
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.020]   which is actually the case for most psychiatric disorders.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.720]   But it's essentially diagnosed by the presence and absence of certain behaviors
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.020]   in a certain period of time or up to a certain age.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.820]   And of course, what triggered, I think, a lot of discussions in recent years
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.560]   is because the number or the prevalence of autism has increased.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.480]   So now it's close to almost 3% of the general population,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.960]   which of course, it's a big number.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.920]   - 3%?
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.280]   - Almost 3%, yes.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.860]   - Wow.
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.860]   - So it has increased even since I was in medical school.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.180]   When I was in medical school, actually, it was considered a rare disease.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.920]   The reason why I actually studied autism, because it was a very rare disease
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.020]   and we had very few resources, so we thought studying a rare disease would be easier.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.980]   But now we also know so much more about this condition.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.460]   So we do know, for instance, that there is a strong genetic component to it,
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.480]   which for a while, obviously, we didn't.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.620]   In fact, in early days, the psychoanalytic perspective dominated,
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.220]   especially in the '50s and '60s.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.260]   So it was thought that it was resulting from having very cold parents,
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.660]   in particular, a cold mother.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.760]   - Emotionally cold?
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.600]   - Yeah, emotionally cold.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   It was the so-called refrigerator-mother hypothesis of autism.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.160]   And then in the '70s, some of the first biological studies were done,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.960]   primarily in twins, that show something quite remarkable.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.100]   That if you have twins that are identical, genetically identical,
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.200]   and one has autism, then the probability that the other one has autism
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.620]   is very, very high.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.460]   - Even with different mothers? - Sure.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.460]   - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.460]   - But generally, we think that there is a strong heritable component to autism.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.300]   So that was like in the late '70s.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.300]   And really, just in the last 10, 15 years, we've learned, actually, that there are genes associated with autism,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.140]   and certainly with very specific forms of autism.
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.140]   And so that's what we would call generally profound autism today.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.980]   conditions that are severe.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.980]   conditions that are severe, that are causing an impairment, that are very often associated with other conditions,
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.980]   such as intellectual disability, so low IQ, epilepsy.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.780]   So because it is a spectrum, of course, it creates a lot of confusion.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:54.820]   And certainly, there's no doubt that there are individuals that have autistic traits that are fully functional in the general population.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:04.820]   But the reality is also that there are kids that have autism who are very impaired and will require, actually, lifelong care of sorts.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.820]   You know, another way of thinking about autism is that autism is not one disease.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:17.660]   And I think, you know, no psychiatrist or even biologists who are studying autism would ever consider that this is one single disease.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:25.060]   The way I look at it sometimes is, like, think about the fever of the 19th century in medicine, right?
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.020]   So you see this very often in movies, right?
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.980]   They will say, "Oh, he has a fever, high fever.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.660]   He's going to die from high fever."
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.220]   Well, that fever could have been a viral infection, a bacterial infection, could have been cancer, metastatic cancer, right?
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.620]   Could have been an autoimmune disease.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.460]   The treatments are very different.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.860]   But in that time, that's all we knew.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.260]   It was we were observing that behavior, in which case, raising of the temperature.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.540]   But we didn't know the biology.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.500]   Today, we will use very different treatments for those conditions.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.300]   And some of them, of course, we don't even treat, right?
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.860]   We just observe.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:05.420]   So I think in autism research, as it is the case for many psychiatric conditions, they are defined behaviorally.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.740]   But there is a disconnect with the biology.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.540]   Very often, we don't have good biological, we don't have biological markers by definition.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.420]   And so that disconnect, I think, creates a lot of confusion.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.180]   I have a couple of questions.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.500]   First of all, is the prevalence of autism higher in males?
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.620]   I've been told yes.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.660]   If it's 3% overall, what's the distribution for males versus females?
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.620]   The ratio varies, also based on severity.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.700]   But generally, it's been one to four.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.100]   So more males than females.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:47.820]   And we just recently had our colleague Nirao Shah on the podcast, who basically said the difference
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.940]   between a biological male and female comes down to this SRY gene.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.060]   Not even necessarily on the Y chromosome.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.180]   If a baby has the SRY gene, you're going to get a fully functional male.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.740]   If not, you're essentially dealing with a female.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.860]   So presumably, something about the SRY gene is conferring a vulnerability to autism.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.060]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.060]   Well, there are a lot of discussions, of course, like what causes this difference.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:19.260]   And some discussions are just in terms of diagnosis, that perhaps some of the girls are not getting
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:25.260]   diagnosed properly, that we do know that some of them are very good at what we call masking the
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.940]   symptoms or learning the skills, social skills, and covering for that diagnosis.
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:37.260]   But what we do know for sure is that there are differences in how the male and the female brain,
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.860]   especially around birth, can actually take up injury.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.340]   So think, for instance, about premature birth.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:49.980]   You know, one of the best predictors for a premature baby in terms of outcomes, it's actually to be a female.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.980]   Just in general, females, preemies will do much better for whatever reasons.
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.980]   You know, the way the nervous system is built, the resilience.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.060]   We know that the maturation stage is also different, right, for the male and the female.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.620]   You know, think about like acquisition of certain milestones that happen much faster in girls.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.940]   They generally tend to speak a few months earlier, to walk a few months earlier.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:20.860]   So just the nervous system is maturing at a different pace and can take injury differently.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.260]   So it could be that that is certainly the cause.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.540]   But at the same time, and as we were talking, since autism is not one single disease,
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.540]   it is very hard to point out to one specific factor that is behind it.
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.340]   I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, David.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.580]   David makes a protein bar unlike any other.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.620]   It has 28 grams of protein, only 150 calories and zero grams of sugar.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.500]   That's right, 28 grams of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.380]   This is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.780]   David protein bars also taste amazing.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.460]   Even the texture is amazing.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.620]   My favorite bar is the chocolate chip cookie dough.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.940]   But then again, I also like the new chocolate peanut butter flavor and the chocolate brownie flavor.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.180]   Basically, I like all the flavors a lot.
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.460]   They're all incredibly delicious.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.420]   In fact, the toughest challenge is knowing which ones to eat on which days and how many times per day.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.460]   I limit myself to two per day, but I absolutely love them.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.220]   With David, I'm able to get 28 grams of protein in the calories of a snack,
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:25.100]   which makes it easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.780]   And it allows me to do so without ingesting too many calories.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.900]   I'll eat a David protein bar most afternoons as a snack.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.020]   And I always keep one with me when I'm out of the house or traveling.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.300]   They're incredibly delicious.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:42.140]   And given that they have 28 grams of protein, they're really satisfying for having just 150 calories.
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.460]   If you'd like to try David, you can go to davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.820]   Again, that's davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.780]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.420]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.420]   Now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts about the fact that getting a great
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.420]   night's sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.500]   Now the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference in the quality of sleep that you get each night.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.380]   How soft it is or how firm it is all play into your comfort and need to be tailored to your unique
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.500]   sleep needs.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.660]   If you go to the Helix website, you can take a brief two minute quiz and it will ask you questions such
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.820]   as do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.900]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.180]   Things of that sort.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.940]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.820]   Maybe you don't.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.860]   Either way, Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.020]   For me, that turned out to be the dusk mattress.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.140]   I started sleeping on a dusk mattress about three and a half years ago,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.180]   and it's been far and away the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.500]   If you'd like to try Helix Sleep, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.820]   take that two minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that's customized to you.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.500]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 27% off all mattress orders.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.220]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman to get up to 27% off.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.260]   You mentioned that autism is diagnosed by behavioral measures or the lack of
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.940]   behavioral symptomology, what we call positive and negative symptoms,
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.060]   which can be confusing language because people think positive means good.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.300]   No, positive is the presence, negative is the absence.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.180]   I haven't looked at this literature in a while, but the last time I did,
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:23.260]   it seemed that babies or young children failing to focus their own gaze on the eyes of other people
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.500]   is one of the major diagnostic criteria.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:31.020]   It seems they look at the face more holistically or they'll zoom in just on the nose,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.740]   but they're not really making as much eye contact.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.220]   Is that still a diagnostic criteria?
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.060]   It's not part of the diagnostic criteria.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.660]   Interesting.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.180]   It's, uh, but it is one of the features that has been observed.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.460]   Uh, of course, it also has to do with just in general, like joint attention is one of the earlier.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.300]   So, you know, uh, if you just tell a child like, oh, look here.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:52.620]   Right.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.020]   So if they kind of like have that attention, if they engage in that attention,
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:05.340]   uh, it's one of the features that is associated with autism is not certainly diagnostic is not, uh,
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.420]   pathognomonic, so to speak.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.580]   So it's not specific to the disease in any way.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.300]   Uh, but there's certainly many deficits and some of them can actually be compensated later.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.260]   Interesting.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.380]   There were some other things I've heard over the years, for instance, that when children with autism
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.300]   have a fever, that their symptoms improve.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.060]   Is that still the case?
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:35.340]   So those are mostly anecdotic reports, um, of patients who would have a very high fever and then,
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.700]   for instance, they were nonverbal.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:44.060]   So many patients with autism, uh, or individuals with autism will have, you know, will be nonverbal.
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.220]   They have very few words or if they, you know, they're, they're not able to communicate.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.740]   And so there are a few reports of parents saying that when they spike the very high fever,
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.380]   they'll start talking in sentences like very briefly or like engage.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.340]   And in fact, I mean, that is known, uh, you know, kids in general, when they have a high fever,
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.780]   they tend to be more talkative.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.380]   It activates somehow the nervous system.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.140]   There've been a lot of hypotheses about this.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:14.940]   Some of them, uh, having to do with how the neurodienergic system is activating during fever.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:22.220]   Others saying that there are some of the cytokines, the immune molecules that are present during fever,
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.340]   that are somehow getting into the brain, activating the nervous system.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.460]   And others as simple as, oh, ion channels, right?
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.460]   Ion channels will open, uh, more when the temperature rises.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.180]   So something about the circuits functioning differently during that, but it's, it's mostly
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.340]   anecdotic, uh, at this point.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:44.620]   It's, and it's certainly, again, probably not present in all individuals with autism also because
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.940]   autism is again, not one single disease.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.820]   So we would not expect it to be present in all.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:54.540]   A few years ago, there was a lot of excitement about the idea that autism might somehow be
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.820]   related, perhaps even caused by deficits in the microbiome.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.580]   There were some mouse experiments of doing fecal transplants from what we call wild type or healthy
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:10.300]   mice into mice that were, uh, had some symptoms that resemble autism and there were improvements
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.340]   observed, um, to the point where I think there were some human clinical trials using fecal transplants.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.420]   Um, whatever became of that?
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:23.500]   You know, I think, again, almost everything has been associated or thought to be causal,
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.380]   but generally demonstrating this is very, very difficult.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:33.180]   So, you know, we cannot deny that perhaps improving the microbiome will improve the, you know,
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:39.180]   the quality of life of some of these individuals, but whether it's really causal, there's no, uh, clear
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.980]   evidence for it.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.700]   Think about it.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.780]   Just to give you another example, think about sleep.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:50.860]   Many patients, uh, will report, especially the ones that are profoundly impaired, will have severe
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.060]   sleep disturbances.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.780]   I mean, 70, 80% of them, you know, they can have nights where they sleep very little, right?
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.980]   Then do that for like a week.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:03.660]   So just imagine even just improving the quality of sleep for those patients can do miracle.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.700]   I mean, all of us, right?
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.580]   If we don't sleep for three, four days, our social skills, you know, we become socially impaired.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.260]   So I think, of course, correcting, uh, a lot of this issue.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.900]   So for instance, many patients are picky eaters, you know, they don't like certain textures.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.020]   So they will never eat, for instance, veggies, right?
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.260]   So that creates in the early days, for instance, we thought that, uh, you know,
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.340]   there are dietary disturbances that really at the core, of course, it remains to be seen
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:35.820]   whether just simply correcting those is gonna be just improving or certainly reversing, uh,
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.940]   some, some of these forms.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:43.740]   But again, most of the evidence points out towards a very strong genetic component, uh, behind it.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:48.860]   And in fact, we now have hundreds of genes that we know when, when they are mutated,
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.740]   there are strongly associated with specific forms of autism.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:57.020]   I'm curious, uh, what sorts of, um, proteins those genes are upstream of.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:03.340]   And I ask because, uh, David Ginty at Harvard, um, and did these really beautiful experiments
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.300]   where he induced mutations just in the periphery.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:11.820]   So outside the brain of these mouse models for autism and saw a lot of the same symptomology.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.420]   Raising the question of whether or not autism originates in the brain
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.580]   or whether or not the deficits in the brain are the byproduct of changes in the body.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:26.860]   Yes, microbiome, but perhaps, um, their skin, their hearing, et cetera, are more sensitive.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:31.260]   And maybe that's why they, you know, you could imagine if you were ultra sensitive to an environment
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:36.780]   that your brain would eventually wire differently according to kind of overwhelmed by what was
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.620]   happening in the sensory landscape.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.260]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.500]   And those are really elegant experiments that he's done.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.420]   Many of the genes, you know, they fit in different categories.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:50.380]   Like you would have genes that would produce proteins that sit that synapses, uh, which
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.540]   was sort of like to be expected.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.340]   Some of them are, you know, ion channels.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.940]   They're proteins that would let ions inside or outside of a neuron.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.740]   There are many of these conditions, so-called channelopathies.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.940]   And they're the ones that are like synaptic related.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.700]   So synaptopathies.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.020]   There are a lot of chromatin genes, so like proteins that pack the DNA in cells.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.100]   Those are chromatinopathies.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.660]   Um, so they're really, again, many, many categories of genes.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.420]   And then what is also interesting is that many of these genes are also expressed in the periphery.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.220]   So I think the experiments that you were mentioning are really elegant
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.300]   because it showed that indeed that can perturb the development of the nervous system,
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.540]   even if they're affecting just the periphery.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.380]   Of course, now in patients, there are present also in the central nervous system.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.540]   So it's always difficult to distinguish.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.340]   But just missing some of these critical periods or perturbing some of these critical periods of
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.980]   development can have certainly devastating effects later on.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:52.380]   So if a parent comes into the clinic nowadays with a child that's diagnosed with profound autism,
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.340]   what is the treatment?
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.620]   Let's set aside the potential for epilepsy, which hopefully they would treat as well,
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.460]   or other things that might be secondary.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.140]   But what is the typical treatment?
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.100]   Are they doing?
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.220]   And let's assume infinite resources, which of course nobody has.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.340]   Most people don't have.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.580]   But if one had infinite resources, what would be done?
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.020]   Would it be behavioral training?
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.700]   Would it be something to control the activation state of the brain?
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.380]   I mean, as far as I know, there's no single treatment for autism.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.380]   No, there's no single treatment for autism.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.900]   Again, in the context of this not being one single disease.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:34.300]   What we can say today is that if, you know, family walks into the clinic with the diagnosis
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.580]   of autism, or perhaps like they receive it into the clinic,
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.060]   there's still like a 20% probability that they leave the clinic with the genetic diagnosis,
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.660]   meaning that it will be pointed out to them that this gene is mutated in your child.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:53.580]   And it may be sometimes a mutation that was present in one of the parents and got transmitted,
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.020]   or maybe it was present in both.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.340]   And somehow, you know, the child got two copies that were modified now.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:06.140]   Or many of the genes were actually mutated de novo, meaning that the mutation was not present in either
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:12.700]   parents, but something went wrong during development, perhaps early in the sperm cell, in the egg cell,
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.220]   or perhaps in early stages of development, and a new mutation was acquired.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:22.620]   But that is also, we acquire a lot of mutations, all of us, we have a lot of new mutations, right?
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.180]   About like 80 new mutations, 30 of them are protein truncating.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:32.140]   So certainly, the challenge very often is to, even when you see a gene that is mutated,
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.540]   to know whether that gene is truly causing the disease.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:41.020]   So very often, the way we know is that we find many patients that have a similar presentation clinically.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.620]   Let's say maybe they'll have syndactyly.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:49.420]   So they're webbing of the finger, and they have autism, and let's say epilepsy.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.540]   And they all have a mutation in one single channel, let's say in a calcium channel.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.820]   So that would be Timothy syndrome, a genetic form of autism, where the mutation is very clear.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.100]   Actually, there's one single letter in the genome that is changed and causes a relatively similar
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.340]   presentation in all of these patients.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.860]   So about 20% of the patients will get a genetic diagnosis.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:17.340]   Now, sadly, that doesn't do that much today, because we don't really have specific therapies
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.220]   for those forms.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.140]   I think the hope is that perhaps we will have individual treatments, whether they're going
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.900]   to be genetic or otherwise.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.860]   So being part of that community is generally useful.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:33.100]   And then the rest of the patients will essentially fit into this larger category of idiopathic,
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.860]   meaning that we don't really know the precise cause.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.940]   I want to talk about Timothy syndrome.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.780]   And I also want to talk about genetic approaches for fixing genes, so-called gene therapy.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:51.180]   Before we do that, would you be willing to just speculate on why you think there's this
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.340]   fairly dramatic increase in the incidence of autism?
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.660]   People will always say, well, maybe it's better detection, better diagnosis.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.340]   So I'd like your thoughts on that.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:07.180]   And if there are increases that can't be explained with that, I just would like your thoughts.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.620]   I realize we're not talking formal biostatistics here.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.220]   I just, in your experience, you're an MD, you think about autism a lot.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.420]   You're working on potential cures for autism and other neurologic conditions.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.100]   How do you think about this increased prevalence issue?
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.700]   Well, certainly the increase is still puzzling, right?
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:32.780]   So I think on one hand, there's no doubt that the changes in diagnostic criteria,
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.220]   which have happened over time.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.780]   I mean, we had to just refine what autism really is.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.260]   That changed, you know, to some extent, the prevalence.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.100]   We've also seen, you know, a diagnostic migration, so to speak.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.740]   So some children, for instance, you know, 30 years ago would have been diagnosed with intellectual
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.060]   disability, and today they fit the criteria for autism.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.020]   You know, about a third of individuals with autism also have intellectual disability.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.260]   So there is also a great overlap between the conditions.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:06.060]   So there's been a move sometimes between the diagnosis over time.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.380]   Of course, there are all kinds of discussions about, you know, availability of services,
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.900]   and to what extent that is also contributing, right?
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:21.500]   But, you know, we don't really, you know, we don't truly understand all the reasons behind
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.100]   like this increase.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.300]   There's no doubt.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.940]   We can't explain.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.500]   We know that it's highly heritable based on genetic studies.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.380]   So we know the heritability is very high, one of the highest for psychiatric disorders that
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:32.940]   we know of.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:38.060]   But of course we can, we don't have the genes for every single form.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.180]   So it is likely that some of them are very rare, right?
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.500]   So essentially just think of it as like, you know, they're individually rare form,
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.260]   but collectively common.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.220]   So it will take a while until we sort of like map all of them.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.940]   And then of course, there are environmental factors that we do know historically can contribute
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.260]   to this.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:01.340]   So there are various exposures to environmental factors like in early days,
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:07.340]   thalidomide, for instance, was one of them that we know increases the risk for autism.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.540]   So of course those are contributing.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:14.140]   But thalidomide was a drug given to pregnant mothers to try and prevent miscarriage, right?
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:14.460]   Exactly.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.340]   It's no longer prescribed.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.060]   It's no longer prescribed.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.980]   It's caused major birth defects.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.940]   Defects, exactly.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.460]   So they're certainly, you know, it's quite complex because first of all,
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.340]   the definition of the condition is quite difficult, right?
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.100]   And I think that is in general like the challenge with psychiatric disorders, right?
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:37.420]   And perhaps one of the reasons we've made such slow progress in understanding these conditions,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   because of course the power of modern medicine is in molecular biology.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:47.420]   You know, we kind of deploy this remarkable force of an understanding.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.460]   And in order to do that, you need two things.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.660]   You need, first of all, to have a very clear definition of what that disease is generally,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.700]   biologically, right?
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.500]   Think about like myocardial infarction, you know, very clearly defined in terms of like what it actually
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:01.660]   means.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.620]   You immediately have biomarkers, right?
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.020]   The patient walks in, you take blood, you can immediately tell, yes, in 20 minutes,
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.540]   you can tell that they have a myocardial infarction based on a biomarker.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.780]   And then the other one, which is certainly very important, which to a large extent is sort of
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:21.340]   like, you know, is the source of all the work that we've done is the unbearable inaccessibility
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.420]   of the human brain, so to speak.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.300]   And to a large extent, the human brain is inaccessible for most of its development.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:33.180]   And so if you look actually across branches of medicine, you can see that there is a very
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:39.580]   strong correlation between how accessible an organ is and how many cures or therapies we actually have.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.740]   Think even just in cancer, right?
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:47.820]   Think about in cancers, you know, which used to be, of course, an incurable disease, right?
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.100]   A century ago.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.540]   Think about like leukemias in children.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.260]   They were like 90% lethal in the 50s and the 60s.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.140]   Today, there are maybe 10% lethal.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.740]   And that is because a lot from this patients, right?
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.260]   It's very easy to collect.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.620]   We've been bringing it to the lab, studying it, like what goes wrong,
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:13.820]   and then deploying molecular biology to develop therapeutics.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.060]   With the brain, sadly, you know, there's no way of doing it.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:24.620]   And so largely to, you know, what we've been trying to do is to like find a way of shortcutting that process.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:30.220]   But I do believe that the major challenges that we're facing in understanding brain disorders, whether
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:37.500]   they're neurological or psychiatric, are on one hand, you know, the inaccessibility of the organ of interest, the brain.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:45.340]   And on the other hand, our challenges are very often defining some of these conditions with biological markers because they're much more complex.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:51.500]   The degree to which correlation has been leveraged to try and understand neurologic disease is kind of staggering.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.780]   I'll just share a couple and I would love your reflections.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:08.380]   I remember when I was an undergraduate and in graduate school, there was this prominent theory that a mother who contracted influenza, the flu, toward the end of her second trimester had a much higher probability of having a schizophrenic child.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:20.060]   And there was so much said of that and then now we barely hear anything about it at all, although I think schizophrenia is more prominent at the toward the poles where you have harsher winters as opposed to around the equator.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:25.260]   But someone needs to check me those on that because those statistics might have melted away with more careful analysis.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.220]   I don't know.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:33.820]   The other thing is that you'll nowadays hear a growing interest in populations for which a given disease is very rare.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.420]   So one of the things that's circulating out there now that's related to the vaccine debate.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.620]   And by the way, I'm just going to myself go on record.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.580]   I don't think there's any solid evidence that vaccines cause autism.
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.020]   And there's not epidemiologically.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:47.660]   There's not.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.140]   There's not.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.300]   I mean, there's this open question as to whether or not vaccines of all kinds can increase inflammation
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.220]   and there might be things downstream of inflammation.
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:28:02.140]   But for the record there right now, there are no published papers that have not been retracted that that support the vaccine autism link.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.740]   I think those papers are being reinvestigated under the new administration.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.500]   But let's leave that aside for now.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:17.900]   People will say, well, you have groups like Amish populations where the incidence of autism is significantly lower.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.100]   Turns out it does exist.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.420]   I looked at these data, but it's significantly lower.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.620]   And then people will say, well, it's the absence of food dyes.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.820]   It's the absence of vaccines, perhaps, et cetera.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:36.540]   But then as a genetic disease, we could say, well, there's also there's a tendency for people in the Amish community to reproduce with other people in the Amish community.
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.300]   So it's a more restricted genetic pool.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:38.780]   Yeah.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.620]   And so that could explain it as well.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.620]   And I raise this not to create any additional arguments.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.860]   There are enough out there between people.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:55.180]   But just because I think the correlative nature of all this is what kind of raises the opportunity for anything that's observed.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.700]   Like a fever, they get better.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.340]   Sure.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:02.860]   But as you said, healthy kids without profound autism also talk more when they have a fever.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.500]   And so there's been so much made of autism in the various conditions that could create it.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.980]   And I think it's been very confusing for the general public, even as a trained scientist.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.660]   It's been very confusing for me.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.220]   I feel like every six months or so, every year, we have a new pet hypothesis.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:24.300]   And, um, but nothing's really, except for these genetic data, nothing really is rock solid.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:24.780]   Right.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.580]   And then of course it's the, the other issue is also that this conditions are disorders of the human brain.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:34.220]   So if you think about it, right, even talking about schizophrenia, right?
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.060]   Hallucinations, right?
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.460]   Or, or phenomenon that are very difficult to study.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.380]   And of course we don't know this.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:47.500]   We know that schizophrenia is present in almost every population that we know of, even isolated population at 1%, right?
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.100]   And again, it's a little bit easier because it's done in adults, right?
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.620]   I think in children is much more difficult.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:58.300]   And in fact, many of the genes that were early on identified for autism were identified in this
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.980]   populations in the Amish populations.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.780]   For instance, there is a very classic example of a gene that is associated with severe epilepsy
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:09.100]   and autism that was identified there for the first time is present in other places as well.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:16.220]   So, uh, yeah, I think of course the, the, the complexity of the problem is that you also want to
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.900]   make sure that you don't just associate something, you also want to reverse it in a way, right?
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.580]   So you would want to do the other experiment where you change it and then it goes away,
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.660]   but you can never do that in the human brain.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.740]   We can just turn things on and off to see whether they're truly causal.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.820]   And then of course, human brain development also takes an incredibly long period of time.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:33.820]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.700]   Right.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:39.420]   If anything, it seems that the human nervous system has done everything possible to slow
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.860]   down that process, right?
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.820]   I mean, we myelinate all the way to the third decade, right?
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:49.340]   Like neurons are born and migrating through the nervous system into early postnatal, uh, years.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:54.940]   Wait, you're telling me that our, our neurons continue to get myelinated, uh, which of course,
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.180]   for those that don't know is, uh, the building of the achievement that allows electrical signals to be
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.620]   passed down neurons more, more, um, efficiently, uh, in until we're 30 years old.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:04.940]   Yes.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.100]   There's evidence that myelination, especially in the frontal areas of the brain are, are continuing
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.980]   up to the third decade.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:16.060]   Our, uh, unfortunately now deceased, uh, former colleague, Ben Barris, he used to shout at people
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.420]   in lab lab meetings.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.900]   When they'd say something he didn't like, he'd say, what do you know?
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.100]   You're not even myelinated yet.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:21.500]   Exactly.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.220]   So he was right.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.420]   He was absolutely right.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:23.580]   Okay.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.580]   So if you're in a disagreement with somebody younger than 30 and you happen to be older than 30,
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.260]   you can, um, leverage the argument.
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:29.740]   What do you know?
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.220]   You're not even myelinated yet, completely myelinated yet.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:32.780]   Right.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:38.620]   Um, all kidding aside, before we get into the incredible experiments that you're doing and
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.660]   the direction that you're taking to tackle these really hard diseases, I have to ask two questions.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:49.980]   First, is the incidence of autism also increasing outside of the United States, or is this something
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.460]   unique to the United States and Northern Europe?
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.780]   Um, I don't know why we always pair those two or I should just be fair to the United States
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.540]   and Australia or whatever.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.820]   Um, or is there something going on in the United States in particular that autism is increasing
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.780]   faster here?
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.180]   Yeah, no, this, the, you know, the, so like the prevalence for autism, you know, has been actually
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.220]   reported to be higher in other countries, even before this.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.780]   Some of the early reports many years ago showed that in Korea, for instance, you know, the, the prevalence
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:23.020]   was very high, uh, now that the studies are done, uh, also like in Scandinavian countries,
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:30.140]   it shows that it's probably around the same, um, you know, kind of like rate one in 30 to one in 40.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.020]   So somewhere between.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:31.660]   Okay.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:39.660]   So it can't be whatever is, uh, attached to whatever United States specific, um, conditions.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.860]   It, I mean, uh, yeah, well, because you hear these arguments, oh, you know,
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.620]   it's the glyphosates in the, in the, uh, the crops in the United States.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.620]   And while I don't favor that argument, I do think we need to be cautious about what's in the food
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:55.900]   supply, but, um, those same people often will, uh, leverage the argument that, well, in Europe,
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.860]   they're not using these things.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.420]   Well, if the incidence of autism is the same and rising, that sort of does away with that.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:01.820]   Right.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.100]   At least the clean logic of that.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.860]   And perhaps another argument, which is very important to, you know, bring is that
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.340]   we find the same mutations, right?
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.540]   I mean, the same mutations, if we're talking, let's say a mutation, a specific calcium
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:17.180]   channel, you know, you'll find it in a patient in Denmark, right?
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.140]   As well as like one in Africa or in, let's say Australia.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.780]   So I think some of these genetic mutations are sort of like the same.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:30.140]   Could we briefly talk about gene therapy and CRISPR just briefly?
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.860]   Because I think in the context of a discussion about these neurologic diseases for which
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:41.340]   currently there aren't perfect cures or even cures in many cases, uh, gene therapy does hold some
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:47.420]   promise, um, in simple terms, uh, that I, and everyone else, uh, can understand.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:53.980]   Could you just explain what CRISPR allows physicians potentially to do?
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.340]   In other words, can genes be fixed in adulthood?
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.020]   Do they have to be fixed in the embryo?
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:03.980]   Um, just give your thoughts generally about, about CRISPR and gene therapy, because I think most people
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.860]   have heard of it, but I think most people don't have an intuitive sense for, for how, how it works.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:15.500]   So gene therapy is a rather actually broad term, and it covers many ways in which you can correct
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:23.180]   generally a gene or a genetic defect that we think it's causal. So on one extreme, for instance, you can
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:32.620]   envision a gene is broken, has a mutation. So what you want to do is you want to put it back. So those were some of the early efforts where you would put it in a virus,
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:36.540]   you would put it in a virus and deliver it to the patient.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.100]   An adult?
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:42.220]   In an adult or in a child, depending on like the condition, with the idea is that the gene is not
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:47.420]   there or like there's not enough of it. So I'm just going to deliver more. That's one extreme.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.820]   Is it injected into the blood or do you have to go into the specific cell type that's lacking the gene?
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:57.820]   Many of the studies were done for blood disorders, of course, because it was easier. So you would inject them.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:03.900]   Of course, the other possibility, sometimes you don't want to put the gene, you want to put the protein already made.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:11.260]   And that is the case for many conditions where an enzyme, so protein that, you know, does some interesting
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:16.300]   chemical reactions that are essential to a cell is missing. So sometimes you just make that enzyme and then
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:21.660]   you deliver that. It's not always working, but in some cases actually works really well.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:27.180]   Now, the other thing that you can do is you can try to correct that defect directly.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:33.260]   That means you need to operate at the DNA level. So somehow you need to get into every single cell
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:41.660]   that is affected and correct that. And that's where CRISPR comes into play, where presumably you could,
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:50.140]   at one point, deliver, you know, the guides. So the tiny pieces of nucleic acid that tell you where to go
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:55.100]   on the DNA and then an enzyme that will do the cutting and then the putting back or various other
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.620]   versions of this that you would correct. Of course, there are challenges with that.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.620]   Yeah. Where do you put it? I mean, so like for sickle cell anemia, I know they've essentially
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:07.180]   reversed sickle cell anemia using CRISPR technology. That's in the blood, right?
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:07.740]   It's in the blood.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.540]   It's of the blood.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:08.860]   Right.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:14.540]   But if, for instance, we know about a genetic defect of, let's say, we'll talk more about this soon,
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.900]   but a mutated calcium channel that disrupts heart function and brain function,
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.660]   and you come in with CRISPR, you know what gene is mutated, you have the healthy gene that
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.260]   potentially you can put back, where do you put it?
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:25.580]   Right.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:31.260]   Do you inject it? I mean, injecting into the heart is possible, into the blood supply,
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:37.100]   obviously easier, getting it directed to the bone marrow, but to the brain is hard.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:41.260]   Yeah. Well, presumably you could inject into the brain as well, right? There are ways in which you
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:45.900]   can inject through either surgery or through an injection in the spinal canal, like intrathically.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.980]   So that's certainly one way in which you can do it. It is very challenging though,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.100]   because of course the brain has a lot of cell types and, you know, you very often,
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.340]   the way you deliver this, like through a virus or through other modalities, you know, there's only
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:05.820]   so much of that virus that you can actually put inside the nervous system. And the efficiency is not
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:13.340]   yet like very high. So another way is to go like one level down. So that gene will produce an RNA that
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:18.380]   will produce a protein. So perhaps we don't have to correct the DNA everywhere, but perhaps we can
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.220]   correct something that happens downstream. And that's sort of like being the strategy that we've
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:27.100]   been using primarily, just mostly because at this point, and probably in the future it will be possible,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:33.340]   who knows, like in 10 years or maybe even earlier, we'll be able to deliver very effectively some of the
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:40.860]   genetic therapies using CRISPR. Because certainly in, um, non-human primate models, things like, um,
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:47.500]   color blindness have been rescued by introducing a gene through a, when we talk about viruses,
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.100]   people often will think, oh goodness, why would I want to get injected with a virus? But we should
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:56.540]   just mention there are things like adenoviruses, which cold viruses are adenoviruses that can be
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:02.700]   engineered so that they don't make you sick, but they can carry a cargo, like a gene you want to put into a
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:07.900]   nervous system or, or body that lacks that gene. So when we say using viruses to deliver genes,
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:13.020]   it's, uh, it's of the benevolent type or at least benevolent motivation. We think that, that those
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.820]   adenoviruses can live in our body for a long time without causing additional trouble. And they're very
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.620]   often modified to make sure that they don't cause disease. Of course, another limitation of that is
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:28.780]   that if the gene is really large, it simply won't fit in a virus. So for instance, that would be the case
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.900]   if you think about a calcium channel. Calcium channel is a gigantic gene.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.620]   It would be very difficult to fit, uh, inside a virus. And then of course, the other thing is like with
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:42.300]   this virus is very often, especially with adenoviruses or AAVs, is that you will have one shot.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:49.100]   Meaning that you have to inject once, uh, and hopefully would work because next time, you know,
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.060]   uh, you may have an immune reaction, right? You'll have, you'll produce antibodies and so you won't be able to
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:59.100]   deliver again. So there, again, there are all kinds of challenges that, uh, you know, people are working really hard to solve.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.380]   And I have no doubt that in the next decade, we'll see, you know, therapies or, you know,
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.860]   perhaps even cures for some of these conditions. Of course. And I think you were bringing this up.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:14.620]   One of the challenges is like when we do this, because especially for disorders of the brain,
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.820]   neurodevelopmental disorders, so autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders,
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:25.580]   disorders, the question is always how early it is too late. You know, how much damage has it done,
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:29.420]   has it been done and how much can I actually correct? And that's one of the things that,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.740]   you know, we're only now starting to really explore as we're thinking about some of the first clinical
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.100]   trials in this space.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:40.380]   - This might shock you a bit, but, um, folks in the quote unquote biohacking community,
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:48.620]   not me, um, are getting, I know some, they've gotten full of statin gene therapy as a body enhancement
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.380]   thing. Cause they're leaving the country cause you can't do it in the United States and literally
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:40:00.940]   getting injection of a, of a full of statin gene, uh, therapy, um, to, I guess, to have more muscle to,
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:06.860]   you know, improve that. Uh, I wouldn't do it personally. Um, I also, I like working out,
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:11.980]   so I don't need a full of statin gene therapy, but it's interesting to note that people are doing this
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.940]   and I'm raising this as a segue into a discussion about stem cells, um, because people around the
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:22.140]   world are getting injected with stem cells in the United States. It's still not allowed by
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:30.860]   FDA for most things. Um, but I think gene therapy has started. It's certainly begun. It's, but it's not
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:37.820]   the sort of thing that your physician offers up, uh, early. It's still very experimental for most things.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:42.940]   - And then for gene therapies, again, in the context of what you're mentioning is some of this, again,
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:48.460]   they're irreversible. So once you put the gene in, you know, and it goes into a cell, let's say through
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:53.180]   a lentivirus that will integrate, you can't take it out anymore, right? That would be very difficult.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.820]   It will get inactivated over time. But so that's what we have to be extra careful with some of these
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.460]   therapies and, you know, make sure that we don't do more harm, right? Which I guess it's always what we
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:10.300]   try. Absolutely. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1. AG1 is a vitamin
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:15.660]   mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens. As many of you know,
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:21.340]   I've been taking AG1 for more than 13 years now. I discovered it way back in 2012, long before I
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:26.780]   ever had a podcast, and I've been drinking it every day since. For the past 13 years, AG1 has been the
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:32.060]   same original flavor. They've updated the formulation, but the flavor has always remained the same. And now,
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:38.060]   for the first time, AG1 is available in three new flavors, berry, citrus, and tropical. All the flavors
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.860]   include the highest quality ingredients in exactly the right doses to together provide support for your gut
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.660]   microbiome, support for your immune health, and support for better energy, and more. So now you
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:52.380]   can find the flavor of AG1 that you like the most. While I've always loved the AG1 original flavor,
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.060]   especially when I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon or lime juice, that's how I've been doing it
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:01.820]   for basically 13 years, now I really enjoy the new berry flavor in particular. It tastes great, and I don't
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:07.180]   have to add any lemon or lime juice. I just mix it up with water. If you'd like to try AG1 and these new flavors,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:12.780]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer. Right now, AG1 is giving
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:18.780]   away an AG1 welcome kit that includes five free travel packs and a free bottle of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:24.380]   Again, go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim the special welcome kit of five free travel
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:30.540]   packs and a free bottle of vitamin D3 K2. Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:35.660]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.540]   I personally have been doing therapy for well over 35 years. I find it to be an extremely important
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.740]   component to overall health. In fact, I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:51.180]   regular exercise, including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training, which of course I also do
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:56.300]   every week. There are essentially three things that make up great therapy. First of all, it provides the
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.220]   opportunity to have a really good rapport with somebody that you can really trust and talk to
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:05.180]   about essentially any issue that you want. Second of all, it can provide support in the form of emotional
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:10.700]   support or directed guidance, or of course, both. And third, expert therapy should provide you useful
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.500]   insights, insights that can help you improve in your work life, your relationships, and in your relationship
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.900]   with yourself. With BetterHelp, they make it very easy for you to find an expert therapist who you resonate
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:24.300]   with and that can provide those three benefits that come from expert therapy. Interestingly,
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   in a recent survey, 72% of BetterHelp members reported a reduction in negative symptoms as a result of
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:36.140]   their BetterHelp therapy sessions. If you'd like to try BetterHelp, you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman

[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:46.780]   Let's talk about stem cells, organoids and assembloids, and you'll explain what those are.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:55.900]   But let's wade into this through the way it happened chronologically. Most people have heard of stem
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:05.100]   cells, cells that could become other things. When I was a postdoc, any laboratory that worked on human
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:10.300]   stem cells worked on human embryonic stem cells, literally cells that were collected from aborted
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:17.660]   fetuses and given for medical study. There was an incredible discovery, which you'll tell us about,
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:25.100]   which basically made that technology obsolete and also allowed scientists to bypass a lot of the
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:30.300]   ethical considerations, serious ethical considerations, regardless of where you sit on that debate. I mean,
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:37.340]   you're using the tissue from a human embryo to study things. You could say some people will support
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:42.620]   that, some people won't, but then a new technology comes along and basically makes that technology
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:47.820]   obsolete, allowing you and others to do the work on stem cells and assembloids and so forth without
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.860]   having to take cells from human embryos, which is spectacular. So could you please tell us about
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:45:00.460]   that discovery of the stem cell technology that really changed the entire game and did away with this
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:06.540]   ethical, serious ethical battle? Let's call it what it was. Sure. Let's start first with stem cells and what
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:13.580]   they are, because I think it's also important to define them. So stem cells are cells that have two properties.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:22.140]   first of all, they in principle can become other cells. And if they are of the most potent type,
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:26.940]   they will be totally potent. So they can make everything. If they're pluripotent, they can make
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:33.020]   almost everything. And then of course there are, you know, lower levels of potency for the cells. So we all
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:38.540]   carry stem cells in us, right? Not in the brain or fewer in the brain for sure, but you know, in the liver and
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:44.300]   in other organs like in the gut, as we renew the gut, you know, every few weeks that is done primarily
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:49.740]   through the stem cells, but those are restricted. They can make everything. They can make mostly that
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:55.420]   specialized cell type for which they have been so like primed. Now the earliest, earliest of stem cells,
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:00.140]   like those pluripotent that are very important, those are present at early stages of development of
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:08.140]   the embryo. And of course that happens post-conception. So the challenge has been that you have to remove them
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:14.620]   from a fertilized egg. And if conception, if life starts at conception, then of course you're
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:19.420]   interfering. So I think a lot of the ethical debates have started because of that. But you know, in early
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:24.860]   days, even if you were to do that, you wouldn't be able to keep those cells. It turns out that the cells
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.820]   are very difficult to maintain. And this brings us actually to the second property of the cells,
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:35.580]   which is that in principle, they can be maintained forever. If you provide the right conditions,
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:42.140]   they will divide and stay the same forever. Those are the two properties. So, you know, you can keep
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:47.340]   them forever. You can freeze them down, put them in a, you know, liquid nitrogen, bring them out anytime,
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:53.180]   and they'll start exactly where they left. And then with the right guidance, they can become other cell
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:47:05.820]   cell types. So only around, you know, 1998, that was that when we could actually maintain some of the cells in a dish. So somebody figured out a soup of chemicals
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:12.380]   that you can add and this cells will survive because after that point, it was not possible. So that triggered,
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:18.860]   of course, the promise of this field that now would be able to take those cells and derive various organs,
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:24.140]   right? Perhaps transplant them, replace organs. Of course, that ended up being much more complicated.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:29.820]   And of course, there were all these ethical debates related to the source of those cells and what does
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:35.580]   it actually mean to use this embryonic stem cells. And yet we've learned a lot about those cells in early days.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:43.580]   What are the properties of those cells? And then almost 20 years ago, Shinya Yamanaka was a scientist
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:50.380]   in Japan at the UCSF, came up with an absolutely brilliant idea. You know, we were always thought
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:57.820]   that the development, the development of the human or of any, it's a one-way street. Once you go down
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:04.140]   development, you never come back. So once you start making, you know, a stem cell that is more restricted,
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:09.740]   and then at the end you make, let's say, a liver cell, you can never go back and become that pluripotent
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:15.740]   stem cell again. And that generally is thought to be useful to protect us from like cancer or like
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:20.380]   any others where we don't have, you know, parts of our hands like differentiating into something else.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:27.980]   And he thought that maybe you could do that, not in a natural way, in an artificial way. And that,
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:33.260]   of course, would be very useful. So what he did is he went and he looked at the genes that are
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:39.100]   expressed in pluripotent stem cells at very, very high levels. So very, very high levels. And almost as
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:44.060]   gene therapy, because we were talking about gene therapy, he took like the top couple of dozens
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:50.460]   of these genes and then started adding them inside skin cells. So he took skin cells, initially from
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.420]   mice and then from human, and then started adding them one by one, two by two, three by three, four by
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:02.060]   four, five by five, six by six, to see whether any of those cells, once they have this combination of genes
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:07.020]   that are expressed in pluripotent stem cells, would somehow get confused and think that they're actually a
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.980]   pluripotent stem cell and then go back in time and actually become a pluripotent stem cells.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:17.500]   And he showed indeed that a combination of four is enough. Of course, you can have six. And that ended
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:24.620]   up being what we today call the Yamanaka factor. In a way it was like, it was almost like alchemy,
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:29.900]   right? Where you sort of like, you know, transform something into something else, right? You make out of
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.980]   this metal, you make gold. It was pretty much like that. It was kind of like the essence of alchemy.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:40.620]   Alchemy. And it turns out that that discovery was so profound because suddenly you could take a skin
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:48.140]   cell from anybody and put those genetic factors in, turn those cells into pluripotent stem cells
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:53.820]   that we'd later on learn. They're almost identical to those embryonic stem cells. And now have those
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:59.020]   cells from any of us and use them for various purposes, perhaps for, let's say, making blood cells
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:05.100]   in the future, or perhaps to, you know, model something else out of the body. And I was finishing
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:11.260]   my clinical training around that time. And I remember even seeing that paper. And of course,
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:18.540]   in my naivete at that time, I thought, wow, this is it. This is going to be, you know, the entry point for
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:24.300]   studying human neuroscience. I was doing experiments at that time, studying actually the cortex and recording
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:30.460]   from animals, electrical activity of those neurons. And always like thought, it's like this disconnect
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:34.300]   between what I was seeing in the clinic, which were these patients with severe, profound autism,
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:39.420]   and then recordings from the brain and thinking, we're never going to be able to do that. How are we
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:44.780]   going to understand this complex disorder of the brain if we cannot even listen to the activity of
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:51.900]   those cells alive? And then suddenly, like seeing that discovery, you know, again, naive at that time,
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:59.660]   thought, well, that could be perhaps the way in which we could make neurons from any patient. And so very
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:06.300]   soon after I came to Stanford, which I guess where we met with sort of like this idea in mind that we
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:13.340]   will be able to make neurons from this patients and rebuild maybe some of the cells or some of the circuits
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.900]   of the brain outside of the body without doing any harm because we're not doing a biopsy of the brain
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:22.940]   or anything invasive, just essentially creating a replica of some of those cells outside of the
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.660]   body, and then finally study them at will in a dish and do all kinds of experiments, whether you remove
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:34.140]   things and add things and perhaps that one day even develop therapeutics. And here we are 16 years later,
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:40.460]   since that process really started, took a long time. But now for the first time, we've gotten such a good
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:46.540]   understanding of some of these conditions and one of them in particular that actually a therapeutic is
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:52.140]   inside and we're preparing for the first clinical trial that is really arising exclusively through
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:57.980]   studies done with this human stem cell models without actually using any animal models, just essentially
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:02.620]   creating, recreating cells and circuits outside of the brain of those patients.
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:11.740]   It's amazing because it allows you to study human cells, which has immense benefit. They're essentially
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:18.780]   limitless in number because all you need is one fibroblast, one skin cell or some cell that you can
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:28.380]   provide these Yamanaka factors to and essentially grow other cells. And we'll talk about what those cells that you
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:34.460]   create are capable of becoming not just cells, but circuits in a few moments.
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:38.860]   But I know it's going to be in the back of people's minds and certainly in the back of my mind.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:46.140]   This idea that when one has a baby that you should keep the umbilical cord because the umbilical cord
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:52.620]   contains stem cells. Usually I think the umbilical cord is discarded. Maybe some people keep it. I don't know.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:59.740]   What is the current thinking on stem cells that reside in the umbilical cord? People pay a lot of money to
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:06.380]   freeze those and most people don't have a minus 80 freezer around. So they pay to do that. What is
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:13.900]   the potential for umbilical stem cells in the future? Is it something that parents, I don't want to say
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:18.700]   should invest in, but if they have the disposable income that they would be wise to do that?
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:24.460]   So those cells that are collected from the umbilical cord are stem cells, but they're
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:31.820]   already quite restricted in what they can make. So their applications are also restricted mostly to
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:37.420]   blood disorders. So I think it's, it's important to keep in mind that they're not so like a universal
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:44.460]   uh, you know, solution to anything that would ever involve pluripotent stem cells in the future or stem
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:49.100]   cell therapies in the future. So again, I think it's important to know that while they have certain
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:54.940]   applications and there have been quite clear cases where the availability of those cells were useful in a
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:02.460]   blood disorder in that child later on. Um, they're certainly not, you know, they have this universal uses as
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.460]   maybe sometimes they're being advertised.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:11.180]   when we hear about people typically leaving the U.S. uh, to get quote unquote stem cell injections,
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.940]   where are those stem cells coming from? Are they coming from those patients? And I should mention
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:21.340]   that there was a clinic down in Florida, um, that was offering stem cell injections into the eye for
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:28.300]   people with macular degeneration. And that clinic was shut down and all stem cell injections in the United
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:35.180]   States to my knowledge all were shut down because those patients, uh, not only did it fail to rescue
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:40.620]   their vision, it actually made them go blind very quickly. Uh, so the FDA shut down, uh, commercial
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:47.580]   stem cell injections. I think there's still places where they do a kind of a workaround. Yeah. Um, and
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:54.300]   it's worth mentioning that PRP, platelet rich plasma is FDA approved. It does not contain many, if any, stem
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:59.340]   cells, despite what you might read. Um, but what, what are your thoughts on like when people go down
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:04.700]   to Columbia, it seems like they go down to Columbia, uh, or elsewhere to get, or Mexico to get stem cell
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:10.940]   injections, assuming the conditions are, are clean. Um, and I, I say that because I know of at least one
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:18.540]   patient who was paralyzed from an injection of stem cells into their, uh, spinal disc, paralyzed, almost died.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:23.340]   Yeah. Fortunately is doing better now. And it was because it went septic the way they got infected.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:27.260]   Well, that's one of the problems. Very often we don't even know what is being injected.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:32.540]   I think that is like a very important aspect. We don't know what is, sometimes are the cells from
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:37.100]   the patient that are being collected. Sometimes some of this umbilical cells, sometimes we don't
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.460]   even know what cells are being injected. Like it could be cells from somebody else.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.940]   Yeah. They're incredibly risky procedures. Of course, they've never really been observed. There've been
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:50.940]   very few of any clinical trials trying to really address it in a very systematic way. And very often,
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:54.700]   that's also the case, you know, that's also because they're not really justified.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:56:00.940]   So in the context of autism, this is very often like done, uh, you know, and it's not just in South
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:05.580]   America. Sometimes there are places in Europe where you can get an injection of some stem cells for
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:10.060]   autism. Wait, parents are taking their kids to these clinics and getting them injected with stem cells that
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:14.380]   come from some other patient. Some, some, some cells that are collected from the patient, you know,
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:19.740]   it depends a little bit on where it's done and how it's actually done. But again, even from a biological
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:26.060]   point of view, you know, what are those stem cells presumably doing? Let's say in autism, you know,
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:29.900]   we don't think that there is a cell type that is missing in the brain. So it's not like those cells can
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:34.940]   go. And I think, as I was mentioning before, most of the cells already restricted in their potential.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:40.540]   They can no longer make any cell types. So, you know, the idea that you take this pluripotent stem cells, uh,
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:46.620]   and you just inject them, let's say in the knee and it will like miraculously grow, you know, cartilage.
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:51.260]   It's, uh, very often not really the case because those cells are not even capable of making cartilage.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:58.140]   So I think there's, you know, very often, um, you know, a lack of understanding of what these therapies
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:03.740]   really are. And then of course, there is sadly a lack of understanding what, of what is actually being
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:09.980]   injected. So, uh, you know, for autism, this is unfortunately happening much more often than you
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:16.780]   would think. So I very often get like parents, uh, or families that are asking me desperately, you know,
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:21.500]   with like exhausted old resource. We don't know what else to do. We've tried behavioral therapy. We've tried
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:27.660]   this therapies, nothing works. And everybody's recommended that we should just go now to South
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:32.060]   America and do this injection. Should we do it or not? Right. And of course, my answer is always like,
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:37.740]   no, because again, there's no reason that that would work. Some parents come back and of course,
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:45.180]   they report an improvement and, uh, which is generally, uh, temporary, uh, to the extent that we know,
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:49.580]   of course, it's never really been studied in a very systematic way. Partly, it's, of course,
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:55.420]   there's a very strong placebo effect, uh, which you can, you know, especially in parents, like by proxy,
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:58:00.700]   when you have a child who's like very sick, those placebo effects are very, very strong.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:06.220]   These parents really want those kids to improve. And so they will see things that are improving. Plus,
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:13.100]   those are still developing kids. So week by week, they may acquire new milestones. And then the other
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.980]   thing, uh, which of course could be part of this is that there is an inflammatory effect very often.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.780]   And so that's almost like the fever in a way, right? Like would increase perhaps some of the
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:28.060]   cytokines will create a fever. Perhaps that is associated. We don't really know, but certainly
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:33.100]   there are dangers, uh, associated with, uh, you know, with like procedures like this that are,
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:38.700]   you know, lack the rationale, first of all. And then of course, then they lack any regulatory,
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:45.980]   uh, um, you know, uh, framework. Yeah. I mean, I think the, the concern is very real for stem cell
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:51.500]   injections into all tissues, but when it comes to eyes or brain, and of course, eyes are brain.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:58.220]   Yes. Uh, that's where I just, you know, deep breath and hold it and like wide eye like, oh my goodness,
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:03.820]   no, because we don't get new neurons. Uh, you lose neurons, they're gone. I mean, we get a few
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:09.260]   in the olfactory bulb, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a few, but you know, once they're gone,
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:14.380]   that's it. Right. And, um, injecting something into the brain, the, the probability of tumor
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:19.340]   growth is, is incredibly high. Absolutely. And especially when it is in the brain where there's
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.900]   not enough space, right? So we know that anything that grows in the cranial cavity will actually push
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:31.900]   down, right? Vital centers. So there are certainly risks associated with that. So let's talk about the
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:37.820]   other approach, uh, which is the one that you are, uh, you've been embarking on. I'll never forget when we
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:43.020]   were postdocs. Folks, we were postdocs in the same room. It was D222. Yes. Uh, we had a lot of pride in
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:49.100]   that room. We had benches, uh, on opposite sides of the room and we sort of, uh, took over that room
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.380]   as an empty room. This is, you probably couldn't do this anymore, but it was like, there's an empty room.
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.740]   Let's bring some microscopes in there. We just started doing experiments there. And I'll never forget,
[00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:06.300]   um, when you started building organoids, you started building nervous systems in a dish and how excited you
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:14.300]   were. And, uh, and it's been remarkable to see your, your arc, uh, to, from that. Um, and it's not lost
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.300]   on me that you were working extremely hard then and continue to, to become what really one of the
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:25.100]   luminaries of this field. Um, tell us what organoids are, tell us why they're useful and
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:32.300]   what they're telling us already about how the brain develops and their therapeutic potential.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:39.260]   Yeah. So let's start from the beginning. So around like, you know, 15, 16 years ago,
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:45.580]   we were able for the first time to get some of the cells that are now known as induced pluripotent
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:51.340]   stem cells. These are the Yamanaka. Yes. Or IPS cells. IPS. So induced because they've been induced to become
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.980]   pluripotent in an artificial way. But again, they stay like that. So you can share them with anybody
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:02.220]   else like afterwards. So we got some of those first cells in those early days. And now the question was,
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:08.540]   how do we make neurons? And what you do is you really kind of like leverage the, everything that
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:13.100]   is known in developmental biology. So we already know that there are certain molecules that are very
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:18.780]   important for making neurons. So all you do is you put those cells in a dish, right? In a plastic dish,
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:24.620]   in a Petri dish. And then you start almost like when you cook, you start adding various molecules on
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:31.020]   top and you see what happens. And we knew that it's actually quite easy to make neurons. That was already
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:35.420]   known. There've been a lot of experiments done the decade before that showed that even if you just
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:41.260]   remove some of the factors that maintain those cells pluripotent, those pluripotent stem cells will
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:47.340]   start out to differentiate and they like to become neural cells. By default. Almost by default. So it's
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:52.860]   actually not that difficult to make neurons. So in those early days, you know, you'll take those cells,
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:57.580]   play them nicely, those pluripotent stem cells in a dish, and then remove some of these factors. And then
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:02.060]   within a few days, you will see that they'll change shape. And within a few weeks, some of them will really
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:09.180]   look like neurons. And when you look at them, you can even sort of like look at proteins that only neurons
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:14.220]   will have, you can actually get an electrode inside a cell and listen to the electrical activity. So it
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:20.700]   was very exciting, as maybe you remember in those days. I mean, you know, this bursting curiosity is
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.060]   always sort of like, you know, the ATP of the life, the, you know, the life in the lab, so to speak.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:31.020]   It is right. I mean, it's just like, I like want to wake up, right, and want to go see what happened to
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:37.580]   those cells. And it was clear in those days that, you know, we would be able to make those cells. But
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:42.860]   would we actually see any abnormalities in those cells? I think it was like the question, you know,
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:48.380]   how would you know if you derive cells from a patient with autism? How would you know that you found
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:53.900]   anything abnormal? I think that was like a question, you know, we didn't even know what would be abnormal
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:03:00.300]   in the brain. And so that's when we decided actually to focus on something that would be relatively
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:05.660]   predictable. And that was this mutation in a calcium channel, which was discovered just a few years before
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:11.260]   in very few patients that had essentially one single letter in their entire genome changed
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:19.900]   in a gene that makes a protein known as a calcium channel sits in excitable cells, meaning cardiac cells
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:27.500]   and brain cells. And every time a cell receives electrical input, this protein opens up and lets
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:32.460]   calcium go inside the cell. And that's very important because it couples electrical activity
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:38.540]   of the network with chemical activity inside the cells. And what we knew about that mutation at that
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:44.540]   point that that's pretty much all we knew in those early days is that it probably allows the channel
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:49.500]   to stay open slightly longer, just a little bit longer. So more calcium would go inside the cells.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.380]   Of course, there will be no way to know because you can't get a neuron or a cardiac cell from those
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:00.380]   patients to actually test it. So what we did is essentially we made, we recruited some of these patients,
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:07.420]   we flew them to Stanford. Then we got a tiny skin biopsy, made this IPS cells. This takes months.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:12.380]   This takes already like four or five months. And then we took those cells in a dish, started to
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:18.700]   deriving neurons. And after about five, six, seven weeks, then we put them under a microscope and we
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.860]   started looking at the calcium. You can measure calcium inside cells through a microscope and just
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:29.340]   literally look at it. And I'll never forget that day, you know, when we did that experiment, was looking
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:35.260]   down the microscope and we essentially stimulated the neurons. And you could just see how control cells
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:40.220]   will go . Calcium goes inside the cells and then it goes out. And then in patients that
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:44.620]   had Timothy syndrome, so in Timothy syndrome derived neurons, you could see how the calcium will go
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:52.220]   and then it will stay longer. It takes longer to go out. So it's like the first defect that we saw
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:57.820]   in patient derived neurons that were actually not coming from a biopsy. They were not coming. So that was
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:03.580]   incredibly exciting as you can imagine. But it was still relatively simplistic, just a few neurons at
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:09.740]   the bottom of a dish. And of course, for me, what was particularly frustrating was that we couldn't go
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:16.460]   very far in development. So think about the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain that presumably
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:22.860]   makes us human, right? It has multiple layers, a large diversity of neurons. You know, it takes 27 weeks
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:28.860]   to make all those cells in the cortex, 27 weeks to make all those neurons. And we're not even talking
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:33.420]   about glial cells as supporting cells that are coming much later for several years afterwards.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:39.900]   But just making those cells takes about 27 weeks. And it turns out something that we discovered in
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:47.100]   a three experiments done in a dish is that the timing of the development of those cells, it's actually
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:54.460]   recapitulated in a dish as well. So if you keep the cells in a dish, they'll actually essentially develop
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:06:01.100]   at the same pace. They're not like much faster. And it's very difficult to keep neurons in a dish for 27
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:05.980]   weeks to get all the neurons. Essentially, they peel off, you know, every time you start to move them to
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:11.900]   another plate and at one point they just die. And so then we thought, how about like never letting them
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:18.060]   to sit down on a surface? How about just essentially aggregating them as balls of cells and then letting
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:25.740]   those float? And in those early days, there was this amazing scientist from Japan, Yoshiki Sasai, who started
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:32.780]   doing really beautiful experiments where he was already moving some of these studies that he was doing of
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:38.620]   development in 3D cultures where he showed you can make an optic cup, a part of the eye. And so it was
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:47.340]   clear, it was in the air, this revolution of actually moving cells from 2D flat cultures to 3D self-organizing.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:54.700]   And that actually unleashed amazing new properties of the cells. So essentially, all we did in those days is I
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:07:01.980]   ordered from Germany this plate that were counter-intuitively coated so the cells never stick, right? I mean, every time we
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:05.980]   keep cells in a dish, you want them to stick, that's the major problem. So they were actually coated so
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.780]   the cells will never stick. And then there were like this balls of cells, they were floating there.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.860]   And of course, I remember talking in the lab and everybody was like, oh, they're not going to survive.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:19.260]   It's going to be a couple of weeks and they're going to... And then a week passed and two weeks passed and
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:24.300]   then they kept growing and growing. And of course, the enthusiasm of every day to see, are they still alive?
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:30.540]   All right. And then we discovered that we can keep them for months. And this three-dimensional cultures
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:37.660]   are now known as organoids, which is perhaps not the most fortunate name because it suggests that it's
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:43.820]   organ-like. And of course, they're not an entire organ. So they're not a representation of the entire brain.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:48.780]   But that's sort of like the term that we refer these days to anything that is so like three-dimensional
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:53.420]   and organizing in some way. And so we started keeping these cultures. And then at one point,
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:58.540]   actually, we discovered that we can pretty much keep them indefinitely. My lab maintained the longest
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:03.180]   cultures that have ever been reported, like literally going for years, for two, three years in a dish.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:10.780]   And at one point in those early days, when I was running out of funds in the lab and I came one day in lab meeting,
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:19.580]   really, you know, determined for us to actually like cut costs. So I've told everybody, go into your incubators
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.700]   because we're spending so much money in feeding the cells and everybody throws out 20% of your cultures.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:30.060]   And then people started saying, so should I throw the ones that are like 500 days old? And somebody was like,
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.180]   the ones that are 800 days old? And I said, what? You guys are keeping them for such a long?
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:37.180]   Yeah, they're just keep growing there in the incubator. So then we actually did the first study.
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:41.100]   And then we had a series of three studies done over the years of like trying to ask,
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:46.140]   how far do they go in development? So if you have a clump of human neurons that you've made from
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:51.100]   pluripotent stem cells and you keep feeding them in a dish, how far do they go in development? Do they
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:58.380]   move much faster? Do they move much slower? Are they stuck at one point in development? And it turns out
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:04.300]   that they actually keep track of development beautifully to such an extent that for instance,
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:09.340]   we discover when they reach nine months of keeping them in a dish. So about the time of birth,
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:13.660]   they literally switch to a postnatal signature really on their own.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:21.020]   In a dish. In a dish. So, you know, there's this classic example in developmental neurobiology. There's
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:29.100]   this protein that usually changes around the time of birth. It's an NMDA receptor. So maybe some people
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:34.780]   know about NMDA receptors binding glutamate. They're very important, but they change a lot during development.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:40.700]   They're made out of different units and the units change. And it was very well known that during
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:47.100]   early development, so prenatal, before birth, you primarily have 2B subunits. And then after birth,
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:52.780]   they're primarily 2A. So if you look in brain development, you just see how essentially 2B goes
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:57.580]   up and then it goes down and 2A goes up. And when you look, they meet around birth.
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:03.740]   So very often people thought that it's birth itself that triggers that switch. That canonical,
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:08.780]   it's called a canonical switch because we all thought that it was like so classic. And then you
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:15.980]   take an organoid that you maintain in the dish for 600 days. And of course, we're not inducing birth.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.740]   We're not changing media. We're not doing anything special. And no hormones from mom. No hormones
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:23.660]   changes. Like, you know, we keep exactly the same media, which is certainly a very simplistic,
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:28.860]   uh, uh, you know, kind of like soup of chemicals, but we don't change it. And then you just look at
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:35.260]   this two subunits and you see how like 2B goes down and 2A goes up and they pretty much meet that
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:41.260]   nine months of keeping them in a dish. It's amazing. So that tells us that there's some sort of intrinsic
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:47.020]   clock. Once you start a development, the cells measure really, really well the time of development.
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:51.740]   That does not mean that all aspects of development are going to now be recapitulated in a dish,
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:55.900]   but it tells us that there is this incredible ability of cells, especially in the nervous
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.780]   system, because of course those cells will keep for the rest of our lives.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:03.340]   We're not never going to renew neurons. It's going to be different for liver cells or gut cell,
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.980]   but for neurons, probably in particular, they'll need to keep track of time really, really well.
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:14.140]   So that was like the first discovery that we saw like made, which is still stunning today. We still
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.220]   don't know the mechanism. We're still working really hard on figuring out exactly how the cells are
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:24.220]   keeping track of time. Because as you can imagine, if we understand what that molecular machinery is,
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.940]   we used to call it the clock. We now call it a timer. We think it's more of a timer than an actual clock.
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:34.620]   But understanding what the molecular biology of that is will allow us actually to play with that clock.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:41.900]   So if you want to make neurons that are, you know, 70 years old neuron from a patient with Parkinson,
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.820]   you know, I don't have to wait 70 years in a dish. Could I make it in like a few weeks?
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:52.940]   Or perhaps could I take an aging neuron and somehow, you know, rejuvenate it by playing with that with
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:57.340]   that timer. But just to make it clear, we still don't know that we have some clues about like what it
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:02.060]   may be, but I think it's still early days. And I think that was like one of the first things that this
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:11.260]   cultures allowed us to do. Just watch development, human brain development outside of the human body
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:17.500]   in a dish and actually witness that some fundamental aspects of brain development are actually
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:23.660]   recapitulated even outside of the uterus and of course of the brain. So that was like the first.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:29.820]   And then of course, I guess I'm a developmental neurobiologist by training and, you know,
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:35.100]   I've done a lot of circuit work in early days. Of course, an obsession of mine was that especially
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:42.220]   for conditions as complex as autism and schizophrenia, we need to recapitulate some of the circuit
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:47.420]   properties of the brain, right? So we now know that, you know, probably both for schizophrenia and for
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:52.620]   autism, it is very unlikely based on the evidence that we have so far that there are cells really missing
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:56.220]   from the brain. You know, we thought for a while that maybe some cells are missing or maybe other
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.700]   cells are in, you know, in excess. But now the studies that have been done, especially with single cell
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.660]   profiling of brains of patients that have already died, showed us that the composition of the brain,
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:11.340]   of the cortex in particular, it's very, very similar. So it's unlikely that the cells are missing or like,
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:16.860]   but likely the way they're connected with each other is that makes a difference. And of course,
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.220]   in the beginning, we were just making this clump of cells. They're all for the cortex,
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:26.460]   but they're like not connected to anything else. So then came the idea of assembloids.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:32.860]   Because most of the cells in the brain connect with cells across the nervous system. And in fact,
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:38.540]   even more interestingly, cells do not reside in the place in which they're born in the nervous system.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:44.860]   We have the largest cell diversity of any other organ, almost 2000 cell types. By the end of the first
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:50.220]   trimester, there are about 600 cell types in the human brain. You know, think about the liver, right?
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:56.540]   Maybe a couple of dozens. The brain has to make, you know, hundreds of times more. So how do you do that?
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:14:02.300]   The only way is to actually make the cell types in different parts of the brain, provide local cues
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:08.620]   there. And then once the cells have been specified, let them move and find their final position. So the first
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:15.740]   assembloid that we've actually made were of a very stereotypical canonical movement of cells in the
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:20.540]   nervous system, which has to do again with the cortex. So the cortex, again, the outer layer of
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:26.460]   the brain has both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. It turns out that most inhibitory neurons are not born
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:33.180]   in the cortex, but they're born deep in the brain. So essentially, all we did is we made two brain regions,
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:38.540]   the ones that has excitatory neurons and the one that has inhibitory neurons. And the plan was to put them
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:44.060]   together, hoping that at one point, you know, the cells will like sort of like know what to do. And in fact, that was
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:49.820]   like one of the first projects in my lab, kind of like planning that. And I remember, gave to one of the students like
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:55.660]   this very difficult task of figuring out how we're going to fuse these two cultures. And they're about three millimeters in size.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:59.180]   So you can see them by eye. And I thought it was going to be very difficult to put them together.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:04.780]   So the student worked for months trying to figure out like biological glues, you know, kind of like
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:10.700]   using various electrodes and impaling them and everything else until somebody else came one day and said,
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:17.100]   like, it's very simple. You just put them at the bottom of a tiny eppendorf tube, which is the
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:21.500]   tiniest like of tubes that you get. You put them there overnight. And next day, they're completely fused.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:25.820]   But they're not just fused. Because now if you look inside, within a few days,
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:30.700]   the cells that are supposed to move, start to actually point out towards the cortex. They
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:37.420]   literally smell the chemicals from the cortex. And they start to move in this very stereotypical way
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:44.620]   towards the cortex. And so that was the first assembloid made around 2015. And I still remember,
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:50.460]   it was Ben, actually, Ben was so excited. Ben Barris was so excited about like seeing the cells. He
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:56.380]   wanted to look at these movies every day. And then he said, I still have this email from him,
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:01.820]   where he was very preoccupied that he kept saying like, this new preparation is not an organite.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:05.580]   It's not a steroid. It's something else. You have to find another name.
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.500]   He loved naming things. He loved naming things. Yeah. And he understood the importance of naming
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:14.300]   things, not just for like career reasons, although he understood a lot about how to build a career.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:22.220]   Perhaps. But because naming like Yamanaka factors made sense to name it after Yamanaka. He got a Nobel
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:29.660]   and is immortalized that way, like stem cells immortalized. Yes. But I think the naming is
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:36.460]   essential because otherwise things can get lost in the technical details. Yes. So who came up with
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:41.580]   the name assembloid? So he kept insisting that I should find the name. So I made this long list.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:47.260]   I still have like the, in my notebook, like I had a long list of about 20 and I would like keep sending
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.420]   Ben one. And you know, like Ben was always awake, like 24 hours. Yeah. He didn't sleep much.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:56.460]   He never slept. So I remember after sending many emails going back and forth and he was just like,
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.860]   no, bad name, bad name. I don't like it. And then at one point I thought, well,
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:06.460]   OID because it's life and then assemble because we're assembled the circuits. So I thought assembloid.
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:10.060]   And I sent this and it says, perfect. I love it. So you named assembloids.
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:15.580]   I named assembloids and Ben sort of like blessed it, like one night at like 3:00 AM.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:21.100]   And so that was the first assembloid. And the first assembloid was for cells migrating.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:26.140]   But then the question was, cells have to find each other and form circuits.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:31.580]   And so within a couple of years, we started making assembloids that will have exons. So the long
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:39.020]   projections of neurons finding other partners. And, uh, you know, how forgot who said this must have been
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:46.380]   Rodolfo Linas or, you know, who said that the brain is sort of, uh, you know, the next evolutionary
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:53.100]   step towards movement, you know, so like the nervous system has been this theories that has evolved as
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:57.980]   a way of like moving around. That was Sherrington. Sherrington said, uh, the final common path is
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:02.540]   movement. He was a physiologist. He was kind of vague in a statement, but I think it was Sherrington.
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:06.540]   And I don't doubt that Rodolfo said something about it too. I'm not going to try and take anything
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:10.540]   away from Rodolfo. Anyone that knows a Rodolfo, Luna says he's not somebody you want to piss off.
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:14.220]   Well, we should check it. Like who actually said it, give him credit. I like Rodolfo.
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.620]   But, but for us that became like the next objective, like, can we actually build a circuit
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:23.420]   that will have a very clear output? So we would know that we've actually built that circuit.
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:27.820]   So what we did is essentially, we thought about like the simplest circuit for movement,
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:33.820]   which is like the corticospinal tract, right? So that means that a neuron in deep layers of the cortex
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:40.540]   sends a long axons all the way to the spinal cord, finds a motor neuron, makes a connection,
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:45.820]   then the motor neuron leaves the spinal cord, goes to the muscle. And essentially you only have
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:49.980]   these two neurons, right? That are connecting with each other, with the muscle, two connections,
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.540]   one between the two of them and one with the muscle. So the simplest of circuits that you can have.
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:57.260]   Now lets me move my big toe. Right. Exactly.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:00.780]   It's pretty, pretty long distance. It's a very simple. And of course, like in other species,
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:04.460]   a little bit more complicated. It turns out that in mice, there's an additional neuron there.
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:09.580]   So there are some changes that, you know, happened over evolution, but for us and in primates,
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:15.500]   it's, it's as, it's as simple as this. So what we did was we essentially made an organoid that
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:21.420]   resembles the cortex and has some of those neurons. And then we made an organoid that resembles the
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:27.180]   spinal cord and has some motor neurons in it. And then we made a ball of human muscle that you can
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:32.620]   make from a biopsy. You can literally biopsy a muscle, you get the myoblast, you grow them and you get a
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:38.540]   nice ball of muscle. And then of course the challenge was that, you know, the reality is
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:43.260]   that we don't know how those cells find each other. Like in development, we know some of the molecular
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:49.180]   cues that they use, but it's, we're far from having a comprehensive understanding of how they find each
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:54.140]   other. And I remember we were sitting down in the lab and kind of like thinking, I resisted actually
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:59.740]   doing this as the first assembloid in the lab for a while, because the probability was like against us.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:04.700]   Like those cells in the cortical organoid that are less than 5%, the motor neurons are less than 10%.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:08.860]   So the probability that they find each other perfectly and in enough numbers to trigger muscle
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:15.660]   contraction was close to zero. And yet you do it, you put the three parts together, you let them assemble.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:21.660]   And within a few weeks, you can actually now stimulate the cortex with whatever you want to
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:27.580]   use, with an electrode, with light, and then the muscle starts to contract. And in fact, the more you
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:33.180]   do it, the more reliable the process is. And then of course we went on to like reverse engineering it and
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:38.940]   figure out that indeed the cells have connected in that precise way. So I think what we started actually
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:44.860]   to realize was that of course a lot of stem cell biology was, you know, I think a lot of biology
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:50.620]   was based on chemical and physical factors that we were leveraging, but we've never truly leveraged
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:59.180]   this kind of like next level of, um, law or power in biology, which is self-organization.
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.660]   The ability of a biological system will build it itself. If you think about it,
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:08.780]   the human brain builds itself, right? There's, of course there are instructions, but there's no blueprint.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:13.260]   There's no plan that the brain constantly looks to make sure that it actually made all the connections
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:18.940]   properly, right? Instructions are sort of revealed at every step for kind of like the next step. Uh, and
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:24.700]   it mostly comes from the cells, uh, finding each other. So I think what we also started to learn from this
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:31.740]   was that all we need to do is make the parts. And if we make the parts right, then the parts will come
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:36.860]   with the instructions and then the circuits will assemble on their own. And so that has been really
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:41.580]   kind of like the, the beginning of it. And of course it became progressively more difficult to build circuits.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:47.580]   And so of course, if you put two, you may think, oh, let's make three. And if you make three, can you make four?
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:53.180]   So actually we just published a few months ago, the first four part assembloid, uh, that actually now
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:59.420]   reconstitutes the pathway that processes sensory information in the nervous system. So you think
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:05.580]   about the cortex, you know, sends out, uh, to control movement and has an output, but it receives
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:10.540]   information from the outside constantly. And that happens through neurons that sit close to the spinal
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:18.300]   cord, have projections in the skin where they sense, uh, tactile vibrations or pain stimuli, send that
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.580]   information to the spinal cord. From the spinal cord, they cross, they go up to the thalamus in the middle
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:28.940]   of the brain. And from the thalamus, they go to the cortex. So this is a four part pathway. So it took us
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:35.180]   years, first of all, to make the parts, um, and then to put them together. And then again, the beautiful
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:40.460]   thing about it is that while we still don't know all the rules of assembly, you can make this four part,
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:45.820]   we call it a sensory assembloid or a somatosensory assembloid, because it turns out that the sensory
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:51.740]   neurons that we can make are mostly sensory neurons that sense pain stimuli. And so, uh, you can actually
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:56.620]   put the four parts together. So the sensory, the spinal cord, the thalamus and the cortex, and you have to
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:01.420]   put them in that order. If you change the order, the cells will not find each other. So you just
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:05.020]   have to create the minimal conditions for them, making the right cell types, putting them in the
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:10.140]   right order, and then they'll find each other. And within a few weeks, so it takes, you know, hundreds
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:15.180]   of days to build a circuit like this. But the beauty of it is that suddenly you look at it and you just
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:21.500]   see spontaneous activity that arises in the entire pathway, just starts to flicker all in sync.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:26.620]   Can you use this assembloid to study the effects of different pain medications?
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:31.820]   Yes. So that is certainly one potential. The other thing that you can do in the first application
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:37.580]   that we've had was for genetic forms of pain conditions. So we very often think that genetic
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:42.460]   conditions where you have a very clear cause, or so like entry points, like Rosetta stones for
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:47.500]   understanding anything. So there are these interesting mutations in a sodium channel. So another channel,
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:53.100]   but the sodium channel turns out that if the channel is overactive because of a mutation,
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:58.860]   you'll have excessive pain. So this patients are highly sensitive, but then if the channel is
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:04.700]   essentially unable to function, then this pain that these patients have loss of pain. And that's equally
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.060]   bad. Many of these patients actually will die because they can't sense pain at all.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:11.660]   Yeah. I think people don't realize that in mutations where people can't sense pain,
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.980]   people fail to make the postural adjustments. Exactly. That, um, allow you to stay alive
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:24.140]   and or to, because you, uh, they, unfortunately they can be resting a little bit too much on their
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.140]   right leg. We, we normally think, okay, no big deal, but you're constantly making these postural
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:33.580]   adjustments. If you don't do that, you actually, uh, can damage the legs that you're, you know,
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:37.340]   you're pushing down too hard on. It seems like a trivial amount of weight, right? It's your own body
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:43.260]   weight. Right. But we fail to recognize just how often we're redistributing our, uh, our position.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:47.660]   No, no, no. And it's absolutely true. Like feedback in general is very important, including through like
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:53.740]   this, uh, painful stimuli through all stimuli in general. And it turns out that if you now make
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:59.900]   essentially a four part assembloid that carries the mutation that causes excessive pain. Now the sensor
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:05.020]   neurons are excessively active. So they keep bursting with activity throughout. And then we thought we're
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:09.260]   going to take it out. And of course, in this patients, they can fire. It turns out that it's not true that
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:13.580]   they can fire for some reason. They're probably other channels that are helping them compensate,
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:20.220]   but they fail to engage the rest of the pathway in a synchronized way. So that's why we need the four
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:25.100]   parts. And I think that's why assembloids generally are going to be very useful because there are emergent
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:29.820]   properties that are arising from the interactions of the cells at distance in the brain and likely many
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:33.340]   disorders. And of course, they're very far from understanding complex disorders such as autism.
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:39.340]   But certainly this interactions, fault interactions at a distance in the circuits
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.780]   are probably going to be, you know, key to understanding the biology of these conditions
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:44.780]   and hopefully at one point like reversing them.
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:50.460]   I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Function. Last year, I became
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:55.340]   a Function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing. Function
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:26:01.500]   provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of your entire bodily health. This
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:06.460]   snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health, hormone health, immune functioning, nutrient
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:11.980]   levels, and much more. They've also recently added tests for toxins such as BPA exposure from harmful
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:17.900]   plastics, and tests for PFASs or forever chemicals. Function not only provides testing of over 100
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:22.860]   biomarkers key to your physical and mental health, but it also analyzes these results and provides
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:28.460]   insights from top doctors who are expert in the relevant areas. For example, in one of my first tests
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:33.420]   with Function, I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood. Function not only helped me
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:38.700]   detect that, but offered insights into how best to reduce my mercury levels, which included limiting my tuna
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:43.500]   consumption. I've been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:47.900]   supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine, both of which can support glutathione production and
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:53.340]   detoxification. And I should say by taking a second Function test, that approach worked. Comprehensive
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:58.220]   blood testing is vitally important. There's so many things related to your mental and physical health
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:03.420]   that can only be detected in a blood test. The problem is blood testing has always been very expensive and
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:09.180]   complicated. In contrast, I've been super impressed by Function's simplicity and at the level of cost.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.980]   It is very affordable. As a consequence, I decided to join their scientific advisory board and I'm
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:18.220]   thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast. If you'd like to try Function, you can go to
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:24.700]   functionhealth.com/huberman. Function currently has a waitlist of over 250,000 people, but they're
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:31.420]   offering early access to Huberman podcast listeners. Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman to get early
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:38.540]   access to function. So I want to discuss an ethical consideration/concern, but before we do that,
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:45.420]   I want to take a step back and just have you reflect. I mean, I will never forget
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:52.060]   the first time I learned neural development, like sperm meets egg and then you get cell duplications
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:56.300]   and then the embryo figures out what's going to become muscle, what's going to become nervous system.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:03.420]   And it's really a, it's a humbling thing to be able to realize that we understand even a small bit
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:09.500]   of that. Yeah. And very little was known until, you know, the sort of early parts of the last century
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:15.100]   really is where some of the defining tissues and interactions were first discovered. It was a
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:23.580]   relatively young science. Nowadays, I'm even more humbled by it because one only has to see a child that,
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:28.620]   you know, nine months ago didn't exist and you, and you really start, I mean, most people understand
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:35.420]   how babies are made. Um, and yet it just kind of, it's staggering. And I think what's so staggering
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:40.700]   about it, what's so miraculous that it really is, it's a miracle is the self-organizing aspect of it.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:48.220]   Yes. And now I'm hearing that these self-organization knowledge of the cells own knowledge about what
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:57.900]   they should do and when is maintained. Uh, and I also have to just, um, both highlight again and, um,
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:03.420]   applaud the fact that regardless of where one stood on the, uh, embryonic stem cell debate,
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:09.740]   you're describing assembloids that were made from essentially taking a fibroblast, a skin cell
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:14.700]   Exactly. From a patient or from a non-patient, a healthy person that doesn't, at least doesn't
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:20.140]   have that mutation, putting them in a dish, reverting them to stemness through the Yamanaka factors,
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:25.020]   then giving them certain things to drive them towards neuronal fates and then other fates,
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:30.940]   putting them together. And none of this involves the use of aborted tissues. No. May I ask you this,
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:41.660]   if today you could bank your fibroblasts turned into a few neurons, um, would you do it? Um, knowing
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:45.820]   that those cells could eventually be used to create any tissue, like, I hope you live a very, very long
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:53.020]   life, Sergio. But let's say when you're a hundred, your heart has an issue. We humans can do heart
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:58.460]   transplants. Yeah. Um, from another human, their immune rejection issues, their, um, pig hearts have been
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:05.100]   transferred into humans, but we could potentially, you could potentially build a heart that is of your
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:10.780]   cells, no immune rejection. Why wouldn't you bank your cells? I think you, you can collect them at any
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:15.260]   time in principle, as long as you can get them on your 99th birthday. I think you can still get them.
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:19.340]   Okay. For sure. It could be an argument. So you have time folks. Right. So it could be an argument made
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:24.140]   that all the cells are going to be aging. So there are going to be some changes happening in those cells.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:29.100]   Yeah. They'll accumulate mutations. Yeah. That could be an argument made about it. On the other hand,
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:34.700]   what we're also seeing with some of the cell therapies that are just being developed now more broadly,
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:39.900]   is that, um, they don't have to be necessarily personalized. So they don't have to be made from
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:47.660]   your own cells. Uh, because, uh, you know, you can use immunosuppression. That's one way in which you can do it.
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:53.500]   So you can transplant the cells from somebody else. Uh, of course that poses more challenges.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:57.900]   If you think about the brain, um, replacing large parts of the brain, which certainly is like,
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:02.540]   yeah, you know, far to the future whose brain about about. Yeah, certainly. But in general, like,
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:06.540]   uh, you know, you can see how in the future we may have like off the shelf.
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:13.820]   Right. Uh, cells that have been made, uh, from a generic individual, uh, that you transplant with
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:18.860]   immunosuppression or cells that have been genetically modified so that they're not rejected by the
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:24.540]   immune system. So they're compatible with all of us now. It's much more likely to become a therapy
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:30.940]   that is broadly used. Uh, I think so that's why I'm not that worried about like harvesting my own cells
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:36.460]   like right now. Where do you sit on this idea that at some point in the not too distant future,
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:43.420]   we will be able to immortalize entire organs within our body, perhaps not ourselves, but our colleague,
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:49.420]   Michael Snyder chair of genetics at Stanford told me, um, that he thinks that at least in my lifetime,
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:55.660]   I'm a little bit younger than he is. Um, I'm almost 50. Uh, I forget how old Mike is almost 70,
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:03.340]   but he said at least in my lifetime, um, that immortalization of tissues, human tissues will be
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:09.980]   possible. He doesn't think that's a, a, a fantasy. Yeah. I think different people mean different things by
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:15.820]   immortalizing something. We generally, you know, think like for in vitro studies or for an additional
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.900]   study, when you immortalize something, it means that the cell is maintained forever, but it generally
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.860]   involves using a cancer like factor, giving them cancer properties. I mean, the cells that are immortalized,
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:30.700]   if you think about it, are either the stem cells that we talked about or the cancer cells. So we always
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:36.860]   have to be careful about like what it means to actually immortalized a cell. Rejuvenate cells.
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:41.820]   That's kind of like an interesting concept. Will we be able to actually rejuvenate ourselves even if they're
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:48.700]   aged? So a lot of discussions have been, um, happening lately, whether you can actually use the Yamanaka
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:55.340]   factors, not to the extent that you completely reprogram a cell, but that you just use them,
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:33:01.260]   you know, just a little bit so that you rejuvenate the cells, uh, not fully. But as you can imagine,
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:06.060]   those are complicated experiments, right? They're going to have to be tuned. You need to control very
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:11.500]   carefully the dial there. Microdosing Yamanaka factors, right? Because you would actually, you, you risk
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:17.900]   moving into another, uh, uh, state, uh, but, uh, you know, you know, that may be possible at one point.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:24.620]   Yeah. I thought that at one point, one of the concerns of using Yamanaka factors and this whole
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:33.180]   technology therapeutically was that you could set the reversal and age of cells back to stemness,
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:40.300]   back to stem cells, but then how do you stop them there? Um, and also how do you send them? I mean,
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:44.700]   ultimately it's not a stem cell that you want. You want a fully differentiated heart cell or neuron,
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:49.260]   you want to stop there. Right. I mean, the idea being, uh, for anyone trying to reverse their age,
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:53.740]   I mean, how far back are you willing to go? Right. Right. And it's true when you use the Yamanaka
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:58.380]   factors or a combination of them, cause you know, we've discovered afterwards that it's not just those
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:03.660]   factors that can do that. There are combinations of other factors that can do the same. So there are
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:08.700]   various combinations. There is a lot of redundancy in that pathway. And if you hit the right combinations
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:16.860]   in a cell at the right time, you can push it back in time. Uh, now, of course, the challenge is that,
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:22.780]   uh, you know, that reprogramming is full in the sense that everything is going to be erased. If the
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:30.060]   reprogramming is done properly directly, all the methylation. So all this metal groups that you put across
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:36.140]   DNA that, you know, accumulate with age are going to be removed, uh, all the sort of like the, all the
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:42.220]   signatures of, you know, are essentially removed. So the cells truly rejuvenated as like in the beginning.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:46.540]   And as you mentioned, you know, perhaps you don't want to do that, right. Fully. Uh, can you do it
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:52.220]   in a way that is a partial reprogramming as some people refer to? Um, but, but certainly that these
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:55.260]   are still like early days for that. Certainly it's a possibility.
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:04.460]   I think for most people, if I said, look, uh, scientists are developing, um, engineering eyes
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:09.900]   that can replace eyes for, uh, people that are blind, maybe one eye, maybe both. They'd say, great.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:15.180]   Right. You're curing blindness effectively. Um, and people are trying to do this. Neuralink
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:22.300]   is doing this. E.J. Chichoniski and Dan Palenka at Stanford are trying to do this. Um, if I said,
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:28.860]   you know, there are, um, scientists and companies trying to develop chips so that, um, paralyzed people
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:34.940]   can walk again, or that people who have locked in syndrome can speak again, uh, through one modality
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:37.420]   or another, they'd say, great. But if I said,
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:47.740]   there are scientists who are building assembloids in a dish so that maybe you don't have like two
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:54.460]   hippocampi, you have three, you have a super memory. Yeah. I think most people be like, whoa, slow down.
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:36:02.940]   You're playing God. That's not okay. And as a parallel example, CRISPR gene therapy, which we talked
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:09.420]   about earlier. Yeah. Was employed by a Chinese scientist to, I think it was to mutate the HIV
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:15.660]   receptor. To modify, yeah, two individuals, two babies. Yeah. So there are at least two babies that
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:21.980]   we're aware of and probably more, uh, around the world, but not terribly many who, for whom CRISPR was
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:28.860]   used to make a genetic modification. Um, those babies were carried to term and it wasn't to fix any particular
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:33.340]   disease. It was to confer them with something additional. Yeah. To, to prevent, in this case,
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:39.980]   to prevent presumed transmission of HIV from the mother, which is not necessarily justified in that
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:46.300]   case. No. Right. Uh, did the mother have HIV? I think the idea was that, yeah, to avoid maternal
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:52.620]   transmission, uh, to the fetus, you would not not have that, but there are other ways in which that can
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:58.300]   actually be avoided. So in this case, it was not perhaps the best choice of a disease to correct.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:05.020]   And I think that's why the scientific community has been quite outraged by both gets the rationale
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:11.100]   and the way the experiment was done, which was not following certainly. Yeah. Yeah. The, uh, the scientific
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:16.700]   community, as you, as you said, um, was very upset about that, which brings us to the question of ethics.
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:21.340]   Yes. So I'm sure being really familiar with this technology that you've thought about a number of
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:26.140]   ethical issues that aren't going to occur to me, or perhaps you've heard about things from the general
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:31.500]   public or from physicians and psychiatrists. What are some of the key ethical issues that come to mind
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:36.940]   when thinking about how assembloids are going to be implemented as eventually treatments for disease?
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:41.180]   Yeah. So we think a lot about like the ethical issues and we think this as a group at Stanford,
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:45.980]   that's part of like my center. Uh, we have like Ken Greeley who's a professor of law and an ethicist.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:51.020]   Uh, but actually we've engaged, uh, many ethicists, sociologists or religions. We're actually going to have
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:56.940]   the first meeting at Asilomar this November on the ethics of neural organoids assembloids and their
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:02.380]   transplantation. And, uh, you know, there are various ways of classifying the ethical issues. The way I,
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:08.380]   so I think about it is that on one hand, there are ethical issues that are related to the cells.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:15.020]   We are taking cells from a human. And so you expect that you have received proper consent, uh,
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:19.980]   for the use of those cells, whatever that is. On the other hand, if for instance, you put them into
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:26.220]   an animal, then there are ethical issues related to that animal. Are you doing any harm? How do we manage
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:33.020]   pain in the, in that animal that has been transplanted? And then there are sort of like issues that are at the
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:39.260]   interface between the two. So for instance, are there any emergent properties that are arising at one
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:45.100]   point, whether they're like in a dish or maybe perhaps in an animal, how complex can a circuit
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:51.100]   like this become? Is there any form of learning of computation? Of course, some people have raised the
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:57.420]   issue that perhaps there is sentience or awareness consciousness. Are they feeling pain? So for instance,
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:01.820]   that has been like one critique for one of the recent work that we've done. Of course, in that case,
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:07.660]   we know, you know, the emotional component of, uh, pain is processed in different brain regions. We don't
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:11.980]   have those, uh, in a dish. So we know that they're not really feeling pain. We have the pathway of pain,
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:18.540]   but also speaks to the fact that we need to be very careful about how we communicate this type of
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:24.540]   research. Even just using terms that are trivializing can actually create a lot of confusion. And the classic
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:31.260]   example in our field has been to call this preparations, this organotor assembloids, to call them
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:39.180]   mini brains, right? Then it may seem like as a trivial joke that it can do anything, uh, you know, any harm.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:45.180]   But you hear that for the first time, scientists have made mini brains in a dish, right? And what do
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:50.860]   you think? You think, oh, it must be a miniature human brain that they're keeping in a dish, right?
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:55.820]   Isolated. And of course that's not true. We have not made the entire nervous system. We can make parts of
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:00.700]   the nervous system. We can put them in various combinations, but we've never made that entire brain.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:07.100]   Actually, I don't know of any scientist who has as a goal to try to build the entire nervous system as
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:13.740]   an exact replica, uh, of the brain. So I think the words matter, uh, a lot. And in fact, that has been,
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:18.620]   uh, you know, one of the things that we've done over the years, uh, a few years ago,
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.620]   I thought it would be really important to get most of the scientists in the field
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:27.980]   together and start thinking about these terms really carefully. And so we got together, created,
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:35.100]   so like an ad hoc consortium and through many, many calls, one-on-one in various groups, we came up with
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:39.900]   one paper, which was published in nature a couple of years ago, which really comes as a nomenclature for
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:44.300]   the field. We, as scientists decided, this is also like the way we classify them. These are the terms
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:52.540]   that we all agreed should be used, uh, and not use, not for instance, um, you know, project, let's say,
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:58.860]   complex terms onto this. We'll never say that an organoid like sees just because there's a retina,
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:03.980]   right? We'll never say that a cortical organoid has intelligence because that's a property of an entire
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:08.620]   nervous system. So we think that this is actually quite important, especially in communicating with,
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:13.900]   uh, the public and that that consortium turned out to be an actually great exercise of getting
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:20.220]   everybody together and now thinking, what are some of the common practices that we should all use when
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:25.100]   we report this experiment? So we just had a few months ago, another paper, uh, that came also as a
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:31.260]   perspective in science where, in nature, where we also, uh, lay it out. So like the framework for the field,
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:36.060]   I think this also speaks to the fact that we're entering. So like a new era in science where I think,
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:40.300]   you know, you would say all these labs are working separately. They're competing with each other. And yet we
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:47.260]   all got together, you know, 25 or so labs discuss some of these issues, reach some consensus, you know,
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:53.180]   and I think that moves the field forward. And I think in general in science, we will need more and more of
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:58.060]   this collaborative efforts because the science is getting more complex. Biology is getting really, really
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:02.940]   complex and there's no one single lab that can solve all of that. Yeah, I completely agree. I think,
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:08.860]   uh, some years back collaboration became the norm as opposed to the, uh, occasional thing. And, uh,
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:13.260]   I always thought that laboratories should be named after projects, missions as opposed to individuals,
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.820]   but that's a, that's another story. Well, kudos to you for thinking about these issues so carefully
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:23.740]   and for gathering people around them, um, in order to come up with nomenclature, going back to this
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:29.580]   issue of naming, what things are called is so critical. It's so critical. And, and we see this
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:35.340]   in the public health sphere. Um, you know, when people talk about gain of function research now,
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:38.860]   you know, it's rarely mentioned that, you know, gain of function studies are critical for
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:42.940]   understanding things. It's not always the case. You're mutating a virus. It's like gain of function
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:48.460]   as a general technology, more specificity of language, I think is going to be immensely beneficial.
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:53.100]   So I appreciate you doing that. And, and these terms change with time. I think it's also important
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:59.100]   to like mention that our understanding evolves, science progresses, and sometimes there are things
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:03.420]   that we thought we understood and then new techniques come and change that. You know,
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:09.500]   I think it was Sydney Brenner who said that progress in science usually comes from a new technique
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:14.540]   that will yield new discoveries and that will create new ideas. So, you know, you think you
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:18.940]   understand something and suddenly you have a new machine that can measure it much better with more
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:23.340]   precision. Or let's say you have this technology when you can now recreate some of the circuits and
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:29.260]   suddenly new ideas come out of it, new discoveries. And then we rethink and we adjust. And I think
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:34.700]   that's the beauty of science that in a way it's self-correcting as we get a better and better
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:39.020]   understanding of the world around us. Also essential for people to hear, because I think whenever
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:46.940]   science or medicine comes out and tries to correct itself, often the general public, not all, but
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:53.100]   components of the general public will go up in arms as, you know, similar to like a teenager realizing
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:56.780]   that their parents also did some bad stuff when they were younger and they're like, see, I shouldn't
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:02.140]   believe anything you say. It turns out science as a whole, I think is a very well-intentioned
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:08.140]   endeavor. You get your occasional bad apples, but I think that this notion of self-correction is,
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:13.420]   it's fundamental. Just like engineering has gotten better. The phone you use now doesn't look anything
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:19.180]   like in terms of technology or speed of the phone you used 10 years ago, likewise with any technology.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:22.620]   That's why it's so important that both when we communicate as scientists to the public,
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:27.020]   we use terms that are not trivializing. I think very often we're told like, you know,
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:31.420]   try to simplify so that the public understand. The public understands much more than we think.
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:35.500]   You know, there are always ways in which you can explain something without trivializing it,
[01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:41.900]   without using a new term or, you know, some comparison so that they understand that. Because
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:49.180]   very often analogies can also be dangerous, right? But I think, you know, I always sort of like assume,
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:54.300]   and that is sort of like being my, you know, my mantra, that somebody really has, when you explain
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:59.500]   even to the general public, that, you know, they have zero knowledge and yet, you know, infinite
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:03.980]   intelligence, right? I think as the saying goes in science. So I think there are always ways of
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:10.380]   explaining science very simply, but also communicating that science changes over time. There are new
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:14.780]   understandings that are correcting the science. And we've seen this, of course, in medicine. We've
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:21.100]   sadly seen it in psychiatry, right? Many, many times by labeling, relabeling, doing treatments that
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:27.660]   perhaps were like not the most, you know, fortunate, right? Over time. But I think it's important to tell
[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:31.500]   the public that, you know, we're, you know, always trying to move towards. I think most physicians
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:37.500]   that I know, most psychiatrists that I know are really motivated by really trying to make their patient
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:49.020]   better. So let's play a, uh, a game where if I say, um, if you take two human cortical neurons,
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:58.220]   or three or five or 10 or a thousand that were developed from, uh, you know, one of my fibroblasts
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:02.220]   and you put it into a mouse or a non-human primate, like a macaque monkey,
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:09.340]   I think you've still got a mouse harboring a few of my neurons or a macaque monkey harboring
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:15.740]   a few of my neurons. At what point does that animal no longer, uh, become strictly a mouse or strictly a
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:21.900]   primate? Um, and then the parallel example, of course, is let's say I could get some neurons from
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:28.300]   fibroblasts that were made from you and those were put into my brain. Right. Um, at what point do I
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:34.380]   become more Sergio-like than, uh, Andrew-like? Yeah. So how do you think about those questions? And it,
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:40.300]   while it might seem too early to consider those, we've learned through history that it's never too early
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:45.420]   to start thinking about the ethical implications of a technology like this, where there's transplantation
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:49.420]   involved. No, it is absolutely not too early. Actually, it's, uh, the right time to think
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:53.100]   about this is as experiments are actually being planned, not when experiments have been done.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:56.380]   Ah, good point. And that's what we've been, that's what we've been doing. And that's why actually,
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:47:03.260]   you know, all experiments that we do undergo ethical approval at Stanford. We, uh, you know, and I think
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:08.860]   most major institutions, right, and certainly in the United States, you have to first propose what you're
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:14.780]   going to do, uh, especially with pluripotent stem cells and especially with animals and a committee,
[01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:19.420]   you know, will decide whether that is acceptable or not. Now, of course there are experiments that
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:25.020]   perhaps are not necessarily illegal, but you know, when you try to break a new frontier, but I think what
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:29.500]   it's important to think about like this process of transplanting or transplantation that you take
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:36.140]   cells and you put them either in another individual or another species is that what really matters a lot,
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:42.460]   we've learned now, is the timing when you actually transplant those cells. So it turns out that the
[01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:49.500]   brain, the adult brain is not very permissive to forming new connections. We don't form them and we may
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:54.460]   form small connections. There's a lot of plasticity at the connections, but we don't have, let's say,
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:59.100]   in our adult brains, we don't have cells that are moving now across the nervous system. We don't have
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:02.860]   entire pathways that are being rewired. You know, you're never going to have a cortical neuron that
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:07.820]   just simply regrows and now connects to a spinal cord neurons, which is why injury to the nervous
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:14.460]   system is so devastating, right? There's so little recovery because the cells are usually not, um, you
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:18.780]   know, not essentially rejuvenating. There are no cells that are replenishing them. It's not just that
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:23.900]   there are no cells to actually replace them. It's also that the cells are just not that eager to connect
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:30.700]   with other cells as they are early in development. And so years ago, we've discovered that, you know,
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:35.820]   while we can keep some of these cultures in a dish for very long periods of time and connect them in
[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:41.500]   ever more complex assembloids, and now they're like literally like dozens and hundreds of assemblies that
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:45.100]   people have made, and not just in the nervous system, actually even outside of the nervous system,
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:49.420]   because now they're assembloids of cardiac assembloids and endometrial assembloids. And so the
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.180]   concepts are like took over and I'm glad to talk about it. We're going to have the first conference
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:56.860]   on assembloids at Cold Spring Harbor this year, which is sort of like to bridge across
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:49:02.220]   fields and try to understand complex cell cell interactions. But even with this most complex
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:07.420]   assembloids, we realize that the cells are still missing cues that are present in vitro. So a few
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:13.180]   years ago, we were doing an experiment looking at some of the neurons that we made in a dish.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:19.180]   And you know, these neurons in the cortex are very often called pyramidal because they look like a
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:22.860]   pyramid. They really have this beautiful triangular shape. And we're looking at the neuron, it looked
[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:29.660]   beautiful, exactly like a pyramidal neuron. And then around that time, we got a piece of tissue that was
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:35.820]   removed from a child who underwent surgery for epilepsy. So when you sometimes have to undergo the
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:41.580]   surgeries, intractable epilepsy is really severe. Maybe you talked about this like previously, you have to
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:45.180]   remove some tissue. And when you remove some of that tissue, you also have to remove some healthy tissue.
[01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:51.100]   And so we got some of that healthy tissue. And of course, we're always like eager to understand how
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:55.740]   the cells that were made in a dish are similar or dissimilar to the ones in the actual brain. We still
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:50:00.700]   like need to benchmark before we use that for a therapy or for anything else. And we compare one day
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:07.020]   some of the cells and we realized to our amazement, I don't know how we'd never notice it or nobody has
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:12.060]   really like made a big deal out of it. But the neurons that we're making in the dish were about
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:18.300]   10 times smaller than the ones in the cortex on average. I mean, there are kind of like miniature
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:22.860]   versions of what was happening. And so it was like, of course, immediately it was like, what is happening
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:29.580]   in vivo? You know, is there something, you know, as they say in vivo veritas very often, right? We know
[01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:35.020]   this has been the case for immunology, that many experiments in vitro have not always panned once
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:39.900]   you actually studied them in an actual patient. So that's when we actually started to also use
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:44.460]   transplantation. Meaning we started thinking, could we actually put some of the cells in an animal
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:49.500]   and see whether they acquire new properties or they look much more like this? And of course,
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:54.700]   transplantation has been used for 40 years. Many of these experiments were done before I was born,
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:51:01.340]   especially in Sweden, when scientists will actually take various cells and transplant them into animals.
[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:06.780]   And so what we did, we started doing is like taking actual organoids, cortical organoids,
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:15.660]   organoids and then transplanting them into a rat, a early born rat in the somatosensory cortex. So
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:20.860]   the, so like the, the part of the brain that senses, uh, it receives information from whiskers.
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:27.340]   And done that, we've done that in the first few days after birth. And it turns out that that was key,
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:32.220]   because if you do it later, the cells don't really integrate that well. They integrate, but they don't
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:38.380]   fully integrate. And if you transplant that organoid into the somatosensory cortex of the rat, and then
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:44.380]   you wait for a few months, that graft starts to grow. The cells become vascularized by the rat.
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:49.580]   They will even receive microglia, the immune cells of the nervous system of the rat start to populate.
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:56.140]   And then when you use, look on an MRI, you now can see that about a third of one hemisphere of the rat is
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:52:02.620]   now made up of human cells. So you can see really from an MRI from the ventricle to the pia. Now you
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:07.420]   may think that that's like an inert piece of tissue that sits there, but it turns out that it is quite
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:13.020]   well connected to the host. And that happens because the brain is still eager to connect at that early
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:18.140]   stage of development, but later on is not. And so for instance, you can do experiments where you can
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:24.140]   actually record the activity of human neurons and at the same time move the whiskers of the rat. So if you
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:28.220]   move the whiskers of the rat onto the opposite side, obviously because the pathway is crossed,
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:34.860]   then human neurons now start to respond to that. And then the, I think probably the most important
[01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:39.900]   consequence of that is that they receive now input. They're now in an environment that is much more
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:44.780]   physiological. So when we now looked at the cells, it turned out that they're like six to eight fold
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:51.180]   larger than when we were making the dish. They're not yet identical replica, but they're very, very close.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:57.020]   And that for us has actually been key and started to actually understand the biology of some of these
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:04.700]   conditions. So for instance, for Timothy syndrome, there is a very dramatic effect in the size of
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:09.260]   the neurons. They're almost twice as smaller than a control neuron.
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:15.020]   In the patient. Well, in the patient, only when you transplant the cells, we can see that defect.
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:19.740]   In a dish, you look at them and they're identical. And then you transplant them and some of them grow
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:25.420]   really large to control and the patients fail. And that phenotype can only really be seen properly in
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:30.380]   vivo. So that has been actually essential also, as we've been developing a therapeutic for this condition.
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:36.060]   And you start thinking like, how do you test a therapeutic? You know, if there's no animal model
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:43.180]   of the disease, you test everything in a dish. You do want to have some safety check, first of all,
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:46.940]   for making sure that there are no adverse effects, but also you want to make sure that it works in an
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:51.500]   in vivo environment. And actually it turns out that this model that we've built was essential
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:58.860]   because now we could take actually the animal and inject the therapeutic into the nervous system of
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:05.100]   the animal, but look at the effect on human neurons in an in vivo context. And, uh, you know, so I think
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:10.140]   that's one application for this, but if you do the transplantation at a later stage, like for instance,
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:15.900]   in an adult, that integration will probably not happen. I see. So it's quite dependent on the species.
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:22.940]   And there's another thing, the farther away the species are, the less likely it is, of course,
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:28.700]   that the cells will integrate. So, you know, think about it. It takes just a couple of weeks for the
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:35.660]   rats to make the cortex. It takes us 20 weeks to make most of the cortical cells. So the human cells
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:41.580]   are always behind. The rat is finishing development very quickly. The humans are trying, but they're keeping
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:46.780]   their pace. So the integration between the two species happens at some level, but it's not perfect.
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:51.500]   And that's actually not our goal. Our goal has never really been to have perfect integration. All we
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:56.700]   wanted to do is to have a better system where we can capture aspects of disease that we wouldn't be able
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:01.740]   to see in another way or test therapeutics that we wouldn't be able to test in any other way. And so that's
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:08.460]   where this actually comes in handy and it's been very useful. It's so interesting that for most people,
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:15.900]   again, I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but for most people, the idea of a chip of a, you know,
[01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:22.780]   electrode implanted into the brain of a patient or spinal cord of a patient, isn't that disturbing to them? I mean,
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:28.140]   no one would choose to do that in the absence of a clinical issue, but well, there are some people who are
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:34.940]   interested in brain augmentation through the implantation of chips to create super memory or to be able to, you know,
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:39.180]   process more bits of information in whatever, whatever capacity, but typically it's discussed
[01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:45.020]   in the therapeutic context. But as soon as we hear about, for instance, you know, a pig heart or baboon
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:50.220]   heart was, was transplanted into a human, you know, all of a sudden it's, it gets to some really core
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:55.580]   things about our humanness. Yeah. And then of course, I can't help but be reminded of all the
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:02.700]   anecdotes that you hear where, oh, you know, a patient died, had donated their heart to medicine.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:06.460]   The heart was transferred. And then the person who received it thought that maybe they had adopted
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:11.340]   some features of a person's experience. And there's a, you know, you can't really do the control
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:16.140]   experiment, but there's a lot of interesting questions that, that border on mystical, but that,
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:21.900]   you know, given that experience is mapped into the nervous system, it's not inconceivable that you
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:26.860]   would have memory traces, at least of bodily experiences built into the organ system. Although
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:31.900]   typically we think of that stuff as in the brain. So, you know, as I hear and learn more about these
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:39.420]   incredible assembloids, I'm very enthusiastic about where this is headed. I also, of course,
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:44.780]   think that treatment of diseases that is like the primary entry point. This is what, you know, as opposed to
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:51.100]   building, you know, superhumans, which is, I think, why that CRISPR experiment mutating the HIV receptor
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:56.220]   was also disparaged. There was this idea that maybe the HIV receptor in the absence of HIV is
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:57:00.140]   performing other roles related to learning and memory. And so there was this, there were kind of hints of
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:07.180]   eugenic type approaches. And that raises a question for me. You mentioned that there are many genes that
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:14.620]   are associated with autism. Yeah. I think most parents or parents-to-be don't take a test for those
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:20.620]   genes. There are companies like ORCID in the Bay Area now that will do deep sequencing of embryos in
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:24.700]   IVF. You know, they'll do, depending on how much you pay, they'll sequence more. This was in the news
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:29.180]   a few weeks or months ago. Yeah. And then people, people start thinking, oh, this is like eugenics,
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:34.380]   right? On the other hand, partner selection, who one chooses to have children with, is its own form of
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:40.700]   genetic selection. Yeah. They'll say, oh, you know, he's very kind. She's very kind. She's very smart. You know,
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:45.340]   that there are people are basing their decisions, hopefully according to features that they would
[01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:50.940]   like to create in the offspring. It's not always the case, but so I think sometimes the boundary
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:59.820]   between, you know, what we call eugenics and mate selection and creating offspring in the purely old
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:08.060]   fashion way, it's blurry. It becomes a continuum. How far off are we from genetic testing of parents
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:15.100]   as a kind of obligatory thing? Now that we know some of the genes associated with autism,
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:23.740]   we test parents for things like Tay-Sachs, sickle cell anemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
[01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:32.940]   things that are almost deterministic. Down syndrome, right? Trisomy. And in some countries,
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:39.340]   they'll implant embryos that are not, as we say, eucloid, you know, the proper assortment of
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:46.220]   chromosomes. But in the U.S., typically that's discouraged. So how do you think about all this?
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:52.460]   Like, I mean, you're not responsible for deciding for everyone, but you're right at the kind of leading
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:57.980]   edge of what's possible and you can kind of sniff what's going to be possible. I mean,
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:04.140]   how much information should a person thinking about having a child have in order to make the best
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:11.500]   informed decisions? So for some of these conditions, you know, it's more straightforward than for others.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:17.900]   You know, as you were saying, some of them are very deterministic. So if you have like 321 chromosomes,
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:22.700]   you're going to have Down syndrome and that's going to be associated with the very classic presentation,
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:28.540]   you know. But for others, it turns out, and I think that's where it's much more complicated than just
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:35.180]   testing and making a decision, is that the, what we call in genetics, the penetrance of the genetic
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:42.780]   mutations is variable. Meaning that you could have a genetic mutation that in one patient could cause a
[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:48.780]   very severe presentation or phenotype and another would be very mild. It's not the case for Timothy
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:53.580]   syndrome, where actually it's quite predictable. Most of the patients that we know, we've never
[01:59:53.580 --> 02:00:00.140]   identified a patient who is non-affected and they're very severely affected. But there are other conditions
[02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:06.780]   that are much more common. I think the classic one is a deletion that is happening on chromosome 22,
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:14.780]   the so-called 22Q11.2 deletion syndrome, known by many, many names. Velocardiofacial syndrome,
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:19.580]   Dijors syndrome, known by many names because it's been, it's so common. It's actually the most common
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:30.540]   micro deletion in humans. About one in 3,000 births. Now, the condition is associated with cardiac issues,
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:36.620]   immune conditions, you know, many of which can actually be addressed medically. But it also comes
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:44.940]   with a 30% risk for schizophrenia. 30%? Yeah. So you think the general population is 1%. So this is
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:53.580]   about 30 times higher. It also comes with the 30% risk of autism. But you could also not have any of this.
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:01:00.460]   There are individuals who are carrying the 22Q11.2 deletion, which is a large deletion, by the way,
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:06.540]   there's 60 genes that are gone in the classic deletion. And yet, still carry it around and have
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:13.100]   minimal defects or phenotypes. Do we test for this 22Q? This is tested generally these days, yes,
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:20.700]   because it's so common. But I think that the challenge is this problem of penetrance. And in
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:25.580]   some patients, and we don't know what the context is, each of us has a very complex genetic background.
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:31.580]   So it could be that, you know, the same mutation, two different individuals will have different
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:36.700]   levels of severity, because one of them perhaps compensates much better, for whatever reason,
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:42.220]   there's a lot of stochastic forces in development. And if a cell, it's much faster at opening the other
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:46.620]   gene, you know, like the similar gene that is unmutated, and in the other case, it wasn't and,
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:51.260]   or maybe there are other environmental factors that are, you know, interacting. But the other
[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:55.980]   possibility is that the genetic background that we have is very different. And so we're still like in
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:02:01.340]   early days of truly understanding what are the effects of the genetic backgrounds in modulating
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:07.100]   the severity of these conditions. But in itself, it's a very interesting question, why some individuals
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:12.940]   can have, you know, a massive deletion, right, of 60 genes, and yet still move around.
[02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:18.220]   So I think that that that's going to be a lot of interesting biology to discover behind this. And
[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:22.140]   then of course, we know that there are differences between animals and humans, right, that we already
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:29.020]   know, that very often, a mutation that would be very severe in a human has almost no, you know,
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:34.060]   defect in an animal model, partly because that gene maybe plays a different role or perhaps the genetic
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:40.140]   background is very different. Speaking of which, what are some of the other diseases that are being
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:47.420]   modeled and studied with assembloids? So Timothy syndrome has sort of like been the first example,
[02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:53.100]   because partly because it was some of the first neurons that were derived from iPS cells, and from
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:58.140]   patients with neurodevelopmental disorders in those early days. And also partly because it's the disease that
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:04.860]   we studied so much on all possible angles, first with 2D neurons, then with 3D organoids, then with
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:12.060]   the assembloids, that at one point, and I like to say that it kind of like a therapy became self-evident,
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:17.260]   so to speak. I mean, we were honestly not, I was not thinking that we would develop a therapy for
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:24.540]   Timothy syndrome, like not in the near future. But at one point, we just accumulated enough biological
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:27.820]   information that you just look at it and you say, oh, this is exactly what we need to do.
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:34.380]   And it turns out that, and this we did about like five years ago, that we understood so well how this
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:39.180]   channel is processed in the cells and what it causes that at one point we realized that all we need to do
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:48.540]   is generate this tiny piece of nucleic acid that we can get inside the cells, it will go in, switch the way
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:54.060]   the channel is actually processed and rescue or reverse the phenotypes. And it turns out that every
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:59.340]   single defect that we've described over the past 15 years in the studies can be rescued by just adding
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:04.780]   the tiny piece of nucleic acid. It's almost like a gene therapy in a way, it just doesn't involve a virus.
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:09.900]   And so this is the first disease and we're preparing for a clinical trial. These patients are very rare.
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:13.660]   So I've been traveling around the world trying to find most patients with Timothy syndrome, even try to
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:19.260]   understand the complexity of the disease, the severity of the disease. And so we now have a large cohort of
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:24.300]   the patients ready and we're preparing for the first clinical trial. We already started producing the drug.
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:29.100]   So it's druggable. We think that it's druggable, but this will be the first therapeutic
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:34.460]   for a psychiatric disease that has been exclusively developed with human stem cell models without
[02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:39.420]   anything else, you know. I like to joke about probably you knew very well Luber's dryer. He developed the
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:45.420]   so-called gene chip, the early days of evaluating genes in different cells. He passed away recently.
[02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:50.140]   He passed away recently. He also, um, yeah, he would bring coffee by. He would bring coffee by.
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:54.700]   He had our office across our D222, right? So he would come at nine.
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:58.860]   Anyone who's ever taken biochemistry, the big red biochemistry book, Stryer.
[02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:03.500]   It's Stryer. That's what it is. I mean, he was an amazing communicator. I think above anything,
[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:08.780]   he was just a larger than life figure who like be able to like go with you in a conversation from like
[02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:11.420]   a deep molecular mechanism to what does it actually mean?
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:12.860]   Yeah. Very kind person too.
[02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:18.460]   So my last conversation with Lubert, which happened, I think a month before he passed away,
[02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:22.700]   he came to my office at Stanford. We would meet like every few months. He was just like so interested
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:27.580]   about like how this is evolving. And I remember he was sitting in my office and then he wanted to
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:31.500]   know, where are you with Timothy syndrome? The paper was still under revision at nature was coming in
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:36.700]   the next few months. And, uh, and then he said like, you know, like the saddest thing is like,
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:38.060]   I'm not going to see this paper published.
[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:41.100]   Like, I want to see this paper published. And I said, like, why?
[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:46.860]   And he goes, do you know what you've done? You know, cause he would usually use with that intensity.
[02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:50.620]   And I thought like, oh my God, maybe, you know, he realized some, you know,
[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:54.220]   we've made the mistake somewhere in the paper or like, you know, it's going to point out to some flaw.
[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:58.780]   And then he says, no, you've demystified the psychiatric disease.
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:00.060]   I said, what do you mean?
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:02.460]   I said, well, you think about psychiatric disorders.
[02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:08.700]   They're so esoteric, so complex mental processes in, you know, that are arising behavioral changes.
[02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:15.340]   And yet you went all the way down to like a molecular defect, a point mutation, figure out the rest.
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:19.980]   And now you're on a verge of potentially, you know, perhaps not reversing, but at least improving some.
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:24.940]   So he was so excited about this. I think I never kind of like think enough perhaps about it,
[02:06:24.940 --> 02:06:29.660]   but he was the last one who's like reminded about like how important it is actually to
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:33.820]   focus on these genetic disorders of which we know more.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:38.700]   Of course, this is just one form of disease. There's so many more afterwards.
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:43.020]   But our hope is that just by understanding and learning from this, we're going to be able
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:47.500]   to apply to other disorders. So another one that we're studying now, there are forms of epilepsy,
[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:51.420]   which are very difficult to study. There are intractable forms of epilepsy.
[02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:56.220]   Patients who have some of these genetic mutations, whether they're in an ion channel or in molecules
[02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:58.460]   that are important for cells to stick with each other,
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:03.820]   they can cause 60 seizures a day. So there are really devastating conditions that are actually
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:08.620]   causing impairment just by having those seizures every single day for 10, 15 years.
[02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:14.940]   And so those are a really big issue right now. So we've been focusing a lot on trying to build our
[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:21.500]   models for this epileptic seizures, either through in vitro studies or after we transplant. And then we study
[02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:27.260]   more complex networks in patients. And then of course, intellectual disability, so severe intellectual
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:33.820]   disability, schizophrenia, forms of schizophrenia. So we've been studying now for almost 12, 13 years,
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:40.860]   22Q11 deletion syndrome. We think it's like an entry point. It's the highest genetic risk factor
[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:47.580]   that we know of for schizophrenia. So we think it may give us some windows into how molecular defects
[02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:54.060]   arise. So I think you can think of most psychiatric and neurological conditions that you can study now,
[02:07:54.060 --> 02:08:00.540]   as long as they have a strong biological genetic component. So I think those that have a social
[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:05.980]   component, those that are triggered by social stress, let's say, right, like forms of anxiety,
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:13.580]   you know, depression, those are much more challenging to study because of course we can mimic that social environment.
[02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:15.260]   Can I make a request?
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:19.580]   - Please. - That someone in your lab tried to tackle dystonia.
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:25.820]   - Yes. - I had the experience last year of somebody contacting me. I get contacted a lot, you know,
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:34.220]   for requests to help with horribly sad situations, right, as one does if you're in the neuroscience field.
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:40.860]   Typically it's people with visual deficits who've gone blind or losing their vision. This time it was a
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:47.100]   mother of a young kid who had a form of dystonia where he was essentially just going from a, by all accounts,
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:53.180]   normal appearing and acting kid to having basically no ability to move or do anything. Couldn't go to
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:09:00.620]   camp, couldn't go to school. And just, it was just a very, very tragic situation. He had a neurosurgery. I
[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:06.940]   will know soon how, how he's doing, but I learned that these dystonias are not super uncommon. I mean,
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:13.100]   fortunately they're, they're uncommon enough, but you just have to witness one of these stories and, and
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:19.260]   turns out there, there is a genetic basis for these. So I'm putting in a vote for dystonia for the parent
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:25.420]   and for the child. It's, it's devastating. Um, and we don't hear from these people very often. Um, and
[02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:31.020]   they're, they're sociological reasons for that. Um, certain diseases are underrepresented in the public
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:36.620]   sphere. Autism we hear a lot about, not just because of the prevalence, but because, um, there's a,
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:44.540]   we have a certain affinity to, uh, kids, um, and that, that explains that discussion for another time.
[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:51.980]   But these dystonias are very hard to witness in a way that, um, has made them kind of, um, uh, veiled.
[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:57.820]   Yeah. To, to the public and that, but they're very, very detrimental and it would be amazing. I know you
[02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:02.380]   already have a lot on your plate. Um, but I'm putting in a strong vote for, but we are, we are
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:06.940]   actually working on, on dystonias because there are devastating conditions and there are now genetic
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:12.380]   mutations that cause really severe forms of dyskinesia and dystonia. So really uncontrollable movements
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:17.180]   in these kids that are really devastating for social, uh, functioning and in general, in general for
[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:23.420]   development. And so we do know a little bit about the biology behind it. We do know that the basal
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:28.700]   ganglia, this deep structure into the brain is very important for movements. You know, we very often
[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:34.060]   stimulate that brain region for Parkinson's disease or parts, you know, of those circuitry. So we know
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:39.340]   it's very important. So we've been trying to rebuild it in a dish. So we now can build some of the circuits,
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:44.300]   we call them loop assembloids, where essentially you can put a cortex and we've made the striatum and
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:48.780]   then you put parts of the mesencephalon and the midbrain and the thalamus and the cells connect in a
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:55.260]   loop and now they have activity. So you can now induce mutations at various levels of the circuit and see
[02:10:55.260 --> 02:11:00.620]   where is that mutation most important. So let's say if you were to develop a gene therapy, where would you
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:05.820]   deliver that gene, right? If you were to choose, if you can deliver it in the entire brain. So these are
[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:11.900]   really, so like early days, but I think the, uh, it can be applied. And I think in general, you know, you're
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:16.380]   mentioning this before about autism, right? And this, you know, even the ability of sort of like
[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:23.420]   communicating, uh, these disorders or how much awareness there is, right? I think when I refer
[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:30.700]   to autism, I generally refer to the severe forms and profound autism. And as we discussed earlier,
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:37.100]   there's certainly a continuum and there are many individuals that are high functioning, right? There are,
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:44.780]   uh, uh, uh, they have high skills. Uh, they may lack certain social skills, but they have other skills.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:51.580]   They're different. They're productive in society. I am not talking about discovering or developing a
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:57.980]   therapeutic for any of these individuals. We are talking about the profound forms of autism. The ones
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:02.940]   that actually the parents are still struggling to even communicate about, right? The kids who may never go to
[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:08.860]   school may, uh, never be able to actually live on their own. The same is the case for many of these
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:15.020]   patients with severe dystonias. So I think it's very important because, uh, I think in the case of autism,
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:20.540]   partly because it's being talked about and I can, because it is a, a spectrum is, uh, you know,
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:26.140]   it's also part of the identity, right? Of a part of the population. And that's absolutely fine. I think
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:30.380]   perhaps like at one point having different terms. Yeah, that would be useful. It may be useful because
[02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:35.820]   we were talking before about terminology, which is so important. Um, so perhaps that would be so like
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:42.460]   useful at one point to define, um, you know, the border between, uh, profound forms of autism and forms
[02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:47.740]   of autism that are, are not really a disease. Yeah. As well-meaning as the psychiatric community is,
[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:53.180]   it's bound by this, you know, DSM, whatever number it happens to be on for, for understandable reasons.
[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:59.500]   But I think, uh, better, um, nomenclature would really help that has societal implications. It has
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:04.780]   to do with how we treat people generally. Um, actually just as a quick reflection years ago,
[02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:11.500]   I sat down with Bob Desimone who, you know, world-class neuroscientist, as you know, but he was the head of the
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:16.300]   national institutes of mental health at that time. And he said to me directly, it was over lunch. He
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:21.020]   said, um, do you know why there's so much more money spent trying to understand autism as opposed
[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:25.340]   to schizophrenia? At least that was the case at the time. And I think it is still now. I said, no. And
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:31.900]   he said, because the, uh, strong genetic link in schizophrenia means that, um, oftentimes the parents
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:38.860]   are struggling as well. They're not bringing their children in and with severe, uh, nowadays it's not
[02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:44.620]   politically correct to call them schizophrenics for people with severe schizophrenia. Uh, it's scary
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:50.620]   to be around. Yeah. It's really scary. Whereas with autism, um, even in the profound cases, these are
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:56.940]   children and as a human species, we, we naturally have this, we want to care for our young and it just,
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:14:01.820]   it just pulls on us. And he said, you know, so there's been this incredible lobby, uh, of the
[02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:10.380]   government and therefore pressure on NIH to, um, direct funds towards studying autism far, far less
[02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:15.500]   for schizophrenia. That's interesting. You know, in light of the homeless problem in California and
[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:20.060]   elsewhere and the huge amount of mental disease and drug addiction, I think nowadays there's a kind
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:25.500]   of a broader understanding of brain diseases as diseases that people suffer from as opposed to
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:31.100]   cold mothering or something, you know, like ridiculous theories like that. I definitely
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:37.340]   want to talk a little bit about, um, you, um, not getting too personal here, but, um, I've known you
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:42.860]   for some years and, um, from the first time I met you, it was clear you were going to work on something
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:48.220]   important. You were going to figure it out and your, your work ethic is like something to behold,
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:54.380]   uh, without inflating numbers. Um, uh, how much time are you, are you spending these days either
[02:14:54.380 --> 02:15:00.380]   at the computer working on things related to your science or in the lab or thinking about your science?
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:05.900]   I mean, of, of your waking hours, what percentage? Well, I've never seen this at work. So probably all
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:10.060]   the time, I think about this all the time. I mean, luckily now, of course I have a lab of incredible
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:16.300]   scientists and many of them now have their own labs. And, uh, we've been teaching so many people
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:21.260]   around the world now, like more than 350 labs around the world to just implement this technology very
[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:25.500]   systematically through courses that we do at Stanford. So I feel we've kind of like amplified
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:29.900]   so much. So there's always something happening, uh, but I've never seen it honestly at work. I mean,
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:35.260]   I think it's, it's, it's so fun to think about, you know, the human brain. It's certainly fascinating
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:39.740]   to think about the biology of these conditions. And of course, for me training as a physician,
[02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:44.380]   I think seeing firsthand some of the devastating effects of, of psychiatric disorders,
[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:49.740]   which it was a very strong, um, you know, motivation to actually go into neuroscience.
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:55.340]   I'll never forget when the org, when your first paper was published as a postdoc.
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:59.420]   Yes. You brought in, um, a cake for everyone else.
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:03.100]   I don't know if you remember that. You brought in cake for everyone else.
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:06.220]   I don't remember. And I was like, this is the first time I've ever observed this. This is awesome.
[02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:12.460]   At the time I was eating cake. I don't eat cake anymore. With each successive decade, I, I get stricter and
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:17.660]   stricter with my eating. I still enjoy food very much, but, um, it's, it really speaks to your,
[02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:21.900]   your spirit and your generosity. I feel so blessed that someday I'll be able to say,
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:27.020]   I can tell you stories from way back when D two, two, two, when we took over that room without
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:29.900]   permission, I think we just did it. I think we just took it. Which is the way to,
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:31.820]   which is the way to do it. It's unincorporated.
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:36.780]   Ben was the one who always said, you know, ask for forgiveness, not permission within the proper
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:43.660]   context, uh, of doing science. Um, he, he, uh, was famous for bringing his experiments to talks
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:48.940]   as a postdoc, so he wouldn't lose time on his experiments. He, and then I think at one point,
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:52.860]   there's a story where somebody called it out, him out and said, Hey, you know, like, why are you
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:56.460]   bringing your experiments to seminars? Everyone else is drinking coffee and doing stuff. And he said,
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:59.820]   because I don't know if your seminar is going to be any good and I don't want to waste the time on
[02:16:59.820 --> 02:17:05.900]   my experiments. You know, he had such a, an incredible spirit about just ceaseless pursuit
[02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:13.420]   of knowledge, uh, which clearly you do as well. Um, Sergio, I am so grateful for you taking time out of
[02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:18.460]   your immensely busy schedule to come here and educate us all on this incredible technology that you've
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:24.060]   developed and that other laboratories are now using. I realize it's a field, um, but clearly a field that
[02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:29.020]   you've been seminal in launching. And, you know, I think for a lot of people, if they were to just
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:34.540]   hear about organoids in the news or hear, okay, we took these neurons and we were able to grow them
[02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:39.100]   in a dish and they formed some, uh, things that resemble circuits and we're putting them into mice,
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:42.780]   they'd say, you know, this sounds a lot like a parlor trick or something that scientists do to keep
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:47.500]   themselves busy with our tax dollars. But I just want to thank you because you've beautifully illustrated
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:55.580]   the linear fashion in which you've gone from human disease to building up technologies, one cell type
[02:17:55.580 --> 02:18:02.300]   in a dish, two cell types, circuits in a dish, three synapses, modeling, using drugs and other
[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:07.900]   approaches, genetic therapies to figure out what actually needs to be fixed, going back into patients,
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:12.700]   which is super exciting. I'm absolutely convinced this is the way science is going to be done on the
[02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:19.100]   brain to cure neurologic and psychiatric diseases. I'm absolutely convinced because animal models,
[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:23.660]   while they have their place, they just can't recapitulate everything we're interested in.
[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:28.620]   And we know that as you mentioned from other fields. So, uh, whatever we have to do to keep
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:33.020]   you going, uh, you look younger than the last time I saw you, which was a while ago. So, uh,
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:36.060]   you told me before we started, you walk a lot. How many steps a day are you doing?
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:40.460]   I do more than 12, 15,000 for sure. So you're walking to and from work?
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:46.300]   Yeah. And I walk all the time. I like to walk, especially when I travel. I, you know, I visit a
[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:51.980]   lot Europe and parts of the world and I love to just walk and art is the only other thing that I do.
[02:18:51.980 --> 02:18:53.740]   Oh yeah. Other than science. I love art.
[02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:54.700]   You paint?
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:59.500]   I used to paint right now is mostly thinking about art and like what, you know, I've, I've seen most
[02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:01.820]   museums in Europe at this point, like several times.
[02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:07.980]   Whose art is exciting? You know, I'm fascinated by, I love art, but whose art are you, um, intrigued by
[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:08.300]   lately?
[02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:13.260]   Well, I mean, I've, my favorites have always been impressionist. Uh, but then I go through phases
[02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:18.540]   and, uh, so I, I love all art as an expression. And I think that's sort of like, uh, you know,
[02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:23.180]   I walk a lot in museums. I think you could, you could probably trace like where I've done most
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:27.340]   of the walking and it's probably done in museums or in California walking at night. And so like
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:29.580]   discussing science with students or others.
[02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:34.460]   Fantastic. And none of this biohacking nonsense, you eat one meal a day. That's how you stay so fit.
[02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:36.620]   I generally eat one meal a day. Yeah.
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:37.660]   How long have you been doing that?
[02:19:37.660 --> 02:19:43.180]   Uh, years, I think, uh, years. I mean, I think in medical school, uh, initially as a necessity,
[02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:48.780]   because, uh, uh, I grew up in Romania and I went to medical school there and there wasn't really
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:54.620]   dedicated time for research. So I had no option, but to do my experiments either very early in the
[02:19:54.620 --> 02:20:00.620]   morning or very late at night. So there'll be very little time, um, to actually like eat to be
[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:05.660]   honest at that time. So I felt that was like running all the time doing experiments or clinical work.
[02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:11.100]   Well, like I said, your, your vigor seems to be just increasing with time as it's really wonderful.
[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:16.540]   Clearly you've found the career path for you and it's going to benefit us all. It already has. So
[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:23.180]   so please come back and tell us about your progress, um, in six months, a year, uh, whenever the time is
[02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:27.500]   right, we'll have you back. And once again, thanks for doing everything you do. You're, uh, in this time
[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:33.020]   of hearing so much negative news and like thinking like science is so, you know, hobbled and all this
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:38.700]   stuff, science needs support obviously, but, um, you know, what's that saying you see on the internet?
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:42.620]   Uh, you know, not all superheroes wear capes here. You're, you're doing God's work. So thank you.
[02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:47.820]   Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr. Sergio Pasca.

[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:21.660]   comments about the podcasts or guests or topics that you'd like me to consider for the Huberman
[02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:26.460]   lab podcast, please put those in the comments section on YouTube. I do read all the comments.
[02:21:26.460 --> 02:21:30.540]   For those of you that haven't heard, I have a new book coming out. It's my very first book.
[02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:35.100]   It's entitled protocols and operating manual for the human body. This is a book that I've been working
[02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:40.940]   on for more than five years. And that's based on more than 30 years of research and experience. And it covers
[02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:47.500]   protocols for everything from sleep to exercise, to stress control protocols related to focus and
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:53.660]   motivation. And of course I provide the scientific substantiation for the protocols that are included.
[02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:59.420]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com. There you can find links to various
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:04.780]   vendors. You can pick the one that you like best. Again, the book is called protocols and operating manual
[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:09.580]   for the human body. And if you're not already following me on social media, I am Huberman lab
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:15.820]   on all social media platforms. So that's Instagram X threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn. And on all those
[02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:20.140]   platforms, I discuss science and science related tools, some of which overlaps with the content of
[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:25.020]   the Huberman lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the information on the Huberman lab podcast.
[02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:29.660]   Again, it's Huberman lab on all social media platforms. And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:34.860]   to our neural network newsletter, the neural network newsletter is a zero cost monthly newsletter that
[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:40.220]   includes podcast summaries, as well as what we call protocols in the form of one to three page PDFs that
[02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:45.180]   cover everything from how to optimize your sleep, how to optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:50.060]   We have a foundational fitness protocol that covers cardiovascular training and resistance training.
[02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:55.260]   All of that is available completely zero cost. You simply go to Huberman lab.com go to the menu tab
[02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:59.580]   in the top right corner, scroll down to newsletter and enter your email. And I should emphasize that
[02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:04.380]   we do not share your email with anybody. Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:14.460]   with Dr. Sergio Pasca and last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
