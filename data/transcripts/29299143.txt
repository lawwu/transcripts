[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.760]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.240]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.960]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.480]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.760]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.440]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.600]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.840]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.060]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.160]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.960]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.320]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.560]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.420]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.660]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.580]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.520]   Well, listeners, I can't believe it
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.400]   and I bet you can't either.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.960]   It's January again.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.820]   A whole new year is here again.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.400]   I hope that your family was blessed by fellowship
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.880]   and deep conversations over the holiday.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.560]   But I know that a lot of us are looking 2024 in the face
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.960]   and thinking, oh my goodness,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.600]   now I have to get started again.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.080]   I don't know if I have it in me.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.740]   You do, and we're here to encourage you.
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.140]   And I brought one of the best encouragers ever.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.140]   One of my best classical learning compatriots,
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.340]   Jennifer Courtney, is here with me today.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.600]   And we are gonna encourage you
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.500]   so that we are all ready to get started again.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.280]   Jennifer, thank you for coming in today.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.640]   - Oh, thanks for having me, I'm excited.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.600]   - I know that you and I have been through
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.780]   a lot of ready, reset, go moments
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.800]   in our long years of homeschooling.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.640]   How long, I want you to tell the listeners,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.760]   how long have you been homeschooling?
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.960]   - So I have been homeschooling since 2005.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.480]   Three of my kids have now graduated from my homeschool
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.960]   and one of them has graduated college
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.780]   and is in the workforce.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.960]   - I think, listeners, that you're probably thinking,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.600]   oh my gosh, she has the wisdom of the ages.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.480]   And she does, she has lots of wisdom.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   But I happen to know that just like me,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.040]   lots of Jennifer's wisdom was hard fought for.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.080]   And we did a lot of the wrong thing
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.600]   on the way to finding a better way.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.660]   Jennifer, would you agree?
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.720]   - Yes, and it seems like every year,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.780]   you might think, well, I made a couple of mistakes
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.080]   in all the years I was homeschooling.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.440]   But really the truth is,
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.120]   it's a little bit of an experiment as you go,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.760]   finding out what works with that particular child
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.020]   in that particular season.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.120]   And so usually, I love your title for this podcast
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.060]   because every year I found that I needed,
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.880]   I would make all these great plans in August
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.340]   and then after the Christmas holidays,
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.140]   I needed to definitely reset for the winter.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.200]   - Yep, it's just there's something different
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   about restarting at the beginning of the second semester
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.300]   than the beginning of the year when everybody's fresh.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.200]   And it's like Anne Shirley used to say,
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.260]   every day is fresh with no mistakes.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.560]   And so I always felt more like that
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.240]   at the end of the summer than I felt in January.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.160]   So why is hard?
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.260]   Well, I gave it away for me.
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.820]   I was gonna ask you, which is harder
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.220]   for you beginning the year each fall
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.220]   or restarting the academics after the long holiday break?
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.320]   - For me, it was always restarting.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.400]   I'm in your camp 'cause it felt like in August,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.780]   I live in Oklahoma, it's hot.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.460]   And by August, we had been through a lot of summer
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.520]   and we were tired of swimming
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.100]   and tired of not having a schedule.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.700]   And we were eager to dive into our new books
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.040]   and use our new school supplies and all those things.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.340]   So it was pretty easy to get us started
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.600]   in August or September.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.320]   But coming back after Christmas can be very brutal.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.140]   - I like what you said.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.780]   In the fall, we are maybe not tired of summer,
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.680]   but we're tired of being hot.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.640]   We've done all the swimming that we can do.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.560]   We've been on all the vacations our family's gonna take.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.160]   We're ready for something new.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.700]   But you know what?
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.080]   Nobody's really tired of being off.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.180]   Nobody's tired of having three or four weeks of vacation.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.780]   And the other thing that you said that's really true is,
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.720]   you're excited about fresh notebooks
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.140]   and sharpened pencils and new textbooks.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.960]   Well, none of that is new.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.740]   When you come back in January, it's just a different page
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.660]   and the pencils need to be sharpened.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.760]   And you've already looked through that book
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.360]   and you know what's coming
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.600]   and not all of it is what you want to see.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   And so, yeah, I agree that it's harder to start over.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.200]   Why do you think that is?
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.640]   Why is after Christmas so hard?
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.820]   Actually, okay, let's be real.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.880]   Why is January so long?
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.640]   Why is January so hard?
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.280]   - Yeah, I think partly,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.200]   so you and I have some mutual friends
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.240]   who live in New England
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.000]   and they always say that this time of year,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.560]   your brain is addled because you're full of cheese.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.520]   - That's right.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.260]   - So I think the lack of good habits over the break
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.900]   probably have something to do with it.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.840]   The lack of good sleep schedules
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.860]   and normal food and all those things.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.080]   But so I think just getting out of our routine
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.900]   makes it hard.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.120]   And then for some people, it's just the weather.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.240]   Kids are cooped up in the house.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.020]   I can remember when my children were small,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.500]   making my son run laps around this one part of our floor plan
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.300]   because otherwise I could not live with him.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.400]   He needed some exercise and it was too cold to go out.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.380]   So some of it's that just lack of routine
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.060]   and then also just the weather, I think.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.100]   - Yeah, yeah, I think that,
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.300]   and we're gonna talk about this
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.620]   'cause y'all, this is not gonna be a podcast
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.180]   where we're all just bemoaning our fate together.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.780]   'Cause while it does make you feel better
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.020]   to think you're not alone in your misery,
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.020]   it's even better if we can think of some positive antidotes,
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.680]   some positive things to do.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.620]   So we are gonna encourage you to maybe think outside the box.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.180]   I mean, like Jennifer,
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.720]   maybe you need to suspend your don't run in the house rule.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.220]   And maybe you actually need to have your kids
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.440]   running up and down the kitchen floor,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.500]   picking up peanuts or dust bunnies
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.600]   or whatever you put on the floor
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.240]   just to get the wiggles out,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.680]   especially if you have little kids.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.160]   And it may be that with older kids,
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.000]   you need to switch the chores up.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.780]   Everybody gets a new chore assignment in January,
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.740]   something they don't already know how to do
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.420]   so that they have to use their brain
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.440]   for something besides schoolwork.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   So we'll give some of those good ideas too.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.960]   I think that a lot of us, parents included,
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   just feel tired when we're starting out again.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.700]   Why do you think that is, Jennifer?
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.380]   - Yeah, I think some of it is just repetition of things.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.820]   So the analogy that I've used in the past
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.780]   is that I come from a long line of Oklahoma farmers
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.340]   and several of them farmed cotton
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.000]   right through the Dust Bowl years,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.440]   which was a very difficult year to be.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.660]   And my grandmother would tell me these stories.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.060]   So I really became curious after I was assigned
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.800]   to read "The Grapes of Wrath" when I was in high school.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.020]   But she would tell me these stories
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.540]   about how she and her sisters and her mom
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.620]   would dust the house.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.540]   And then an hour later,
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.860]   there'd be an inch of dust on everything again,
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.320]   'cause there was dust blowing across the prairies
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.780]   and the houses weren't well insulated.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.580]   And so they had to tie handkerchiefs around their faces
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.460]   to keep from breathing it,
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.500]   and they just had to dust once an hour.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.800]   I can't even imagine.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   - Me either.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.400]   - But I think sometimes that's what we feel like.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.660]   We're just dusting and then we look over
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.500]   and there's more dust.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.780]   So I think it's a good analogy sometimes for our homeschool.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.860]   One thing I always remember is when my kids were little
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.120]   and I was teaching the third and fourth one to read,
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.800]   that when they get to the word "the"
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.340]   and they say things like "to her,"
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.420]   you're like, "No, still 'the.'"
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.600]   - Nope, still "the." - It was "the" yesterday,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.880]   it will be "the" tomorrow.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.540]   - Yes, yes.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.240]   - It's just some of that, I think, repetition,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.580]   that constant dusting and knowing you have to do it again.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.520]   So you can use that analogy for their struggles in math
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.300]   or their struggles in reading, fill in the blank.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:22.120]   But one of the things that I think was true for my ancestors
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.060]   is that they kept on going because they loved their home.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.780]   They loved the farm and the land and so they kept laboring.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.180]   And I think that's true for us too.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.180]   We love our kids, we love our homes, and so we keep dusting.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.140]   - Right, we keep doing what we believed in
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.560]   in September and October and November.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.480]   We keep doing what we believed in.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.020]   And if you've had one child already,
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.300]   you know that the repetition,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:01.700]   while it seems relentless and on some days fruitless,
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.040]   it's not, because you do see the fruit,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.100]   that repetition, duration, intensity over time
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.040]   is what brings mastery of math problems
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.180]   and reading words and everything.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.180]   And so I think that we have to give ourselves permission
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:28.220]   to be tired, but we have to remind ourselves
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.460]   that there is a rainbow on the other side of the gray clouds.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.340]   - And it happens suddenly.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.300]   I think your analogy is a good one, Lisa,
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.400]   because I can remember with my firstborn,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.720]   just practicing, practicing, cultivating the habits,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.020]   checking the work, inspecting, having the conversations,
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.480]   working out the frustrations.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.960]   And then it really felt like all of a sudden,
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.520]   there he was in a suit and tie presenting a senior thesis.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.560]   - Oh my gosh, that is so true.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.720]   That is so true.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.700]   - It was over and he was grown
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.940]   and a beautiful human being standing before me.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.940]   - Yes, yes, it's become such a trite statement
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.080]   that we've heard and we've all said it.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.040]   The days are long, but the years are short.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.780]   But I discovered that even trite statements
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.280]   have a lot of truth in them.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   When my girls got, they grew up and it did seem sudden.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.760]   Now there were lots of days that I thought would never end
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   and lots of ditches that we seemed to take a long time
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:47.040]   to climb out of, but all of this sudden, it was done.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.100]   And they were beautiful young women
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.940]   that the Lord had allowed me a hand in nurturing.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.240]   And it was all worth it in that shining moment.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.920]   It is all, all worth it.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.380]   - And then they get to be adults.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.880]   And I don't know about your experience,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.560]   but my oldest two particularly now will come
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.760]   and tell me thank you for things that we worked through.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   And they'll tell me they're so grateful that we homeschooled.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.000]   And they didn't always say that when they were 14,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.200]   just to be clear.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.360]   - Yes, yes.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.940]   - You work for CC and you're so committed,
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.300]   your kids just must love it.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.940]   And as far as I know, they're kids just like everyone else.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.520]   - My kids also beg not to do the one AC.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.780]   - Oh, yes.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.880]   - Yes, I mean, I had kids who said,
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.720]   "Please, can I stop with the Latin
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.860]   "or do I really have to do advanced math?"
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.320]   And so, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.660]   We are the same.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.460]   - Yes, and I had one that really was very fearful
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.480]   of public speaking and just for years,
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.840]   begged to get out of speeches and debates.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.340]   And then her last year in Classical Conversations,
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.540]   she just gave, she won her team policy debate.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.780]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.880]   - And she gave a beautiful advocacy speech.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   And it was just really fun to see that we made,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.860]   that we made the right decision to keep pushing
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.460]   into something that she didn't feel comfortable with,
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.200]   yet she conquered it.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.640]   - Right, the Lord honored her effort
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.400]   and honored her obedience to you.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.200]   - And that was beautiful for you to see, I know.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.880]   Okay, so let me ask you this, in your experience,
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.940]   'cause Jennifer, you haven't just been a homeschool mama,
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.520]   although that's never a just, okay?
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.760]   But you've also been a curriculum developer
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.360]   and a state manager and a practicum speaker
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.560]   and all these other things.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.420]   So I know that you have talked to people,
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.600]   well, all over the country, but all over the world as well.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.340]   What is it that you have heard, what is hard
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.700]   and why is it so hard for mamas,
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.480]   for us weary mamas in January?
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.800]   What is it that's hard for mamas?
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.600]   - Well, one thing I can say is that the children
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.360]   may be resting and having fun over the holidays,
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.560]   but moms are usually working triple time
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.800]   to make the holidays happen.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   The cooking and the entertaining and all of those things
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.260]   that made it hard even just to get the laundry done.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.680]   And so moms come into January tired
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.360]   because they've spent at least three weeks on overdrive.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.480]   And so I think one thing is just to take a minute
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   to rest yourself and sit still and think about
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.080]   what you wanna do for the second semester.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.480]   And then also as my kids got older, I sat down with them
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.600]   and said, let's assess our first semester.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.440]   What went well, what do we need to do better?
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.560]   Do you have any suggestions for something new
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.840]   you would like to learn and do you have suggestions
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.000]   for how we can tackle the thing that you just said
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.280]   needed to go better?
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   And I've had kids in my home tell me all kinds of things.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.460]   One of them said, I really think we need to start
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.800]   this science book over.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.680]   I did not understand it, I would like to start over.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.020]   And so that's what we did.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.940]   I thought that was a reasonable suggestion
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.280]   for a 14 year old to make.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.480]   - Good, all right, so those things are hard.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.640]   Yeah, I think you're right, that's actually very profound.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.280]   Moms come into January and we're just tired.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.420]   December was not a vacation.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.240]   It was different, but it wasn't a vacation.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.520]   But then I also love what you said.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.520]   Sometimes January is hard because we have been pulling
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.920]   an 800 pound load uphill by ourselves
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.880]   and it wasn't the right load.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.080]   We need to redistribute the load or get some fresh horses
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.440]   or something, you're right, that we sometimes,
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.120]   January is hard because contemplating doing more
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.240]   of what we did in the fall, we know is not the right thing.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.260]   And we just need to do something else.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.100]   That's really good.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.820]   Anything else that you think is just hard for moms and why?
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.400]   - I think when we're tired, so generally speaking,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.680]   after years of working with homeschool families,
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.960]   I think that there can, one of our besetting sins
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.880]   is that there's a lot of fear that we're gonna do something
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.280]   that will ruin our kids or that we are gonna make a decision
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.020]   causes them to miss out on something amazing.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:47.080]   And so when we're tired, those doubts and fears,
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.520]   we're even more likely to listen to them
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.200]   because we're tired.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   And so, resetting our time in the word
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.020]   and getting some friends to encourage you
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.140]   becomes super important in those moments when you're tired.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.620]   So I always counsel people to get,
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.360]   to have their classical conversations directors
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.200]   pray for them.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.220]   They are standing by wanting to do that thing.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.600]   They want to pray for all the members in their communities.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.960]   And so being transparent with each other
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.600]   is important at this time of year when we're tired
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.200]   and those fears creep in.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.880]   - That's really good.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.720]   That is good.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.600]   And you know, I think it's wise that we recognize
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.200]   that when we get still again after being so busy
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.120]   through the holidays, we can hear those niggling fears.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.680]   We can hear those, but what if this is not working
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.880]   and what if I'm not doing the right thing
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.180]   and I haven't seen the results I thought I would,
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.620]   is it my fault?
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.720]   When we get still in January,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.980]   that's when we hear those fears.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.600]   Really, really good, Jennifer.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.980]   All right, so why is January hard for students
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.920]   and how can we help them?
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.280]   - Well, I think they've had a complete lack of routine
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.660]   for three weeks.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.980]   They've had no sleep and tons of sugar.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.960]   It's a bad combination.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.240]   And so I always used that first week in January
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.560]   when our community wasn't meeting
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.100]   to try to reset what we were eating and how we were sleeping
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.600]   and to try to ease back into the school schedule
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.740]   of getting up and at least doing some math and reading
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.820]   and just getting us gently back into the routine.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.380]   - I like that.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.020]   Y'all, you heard it here.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.020]   You have permission to ease back in to January.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.580]   I think that that is a kinder, gentler approach
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.140]   to second semester and it will bode well
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.180]   'cause the truth is we are all off our schedule.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:00.180]   Most of us did bend the rules of everyday life
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.180]   a lot for the holidays.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.940]   We stayed up later, we did more, we ate more poorly.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.300]   We let the kids go, go, go and watch, watch, watch
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.700]   and do, do, do.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.300]   So now we have to get back to the reality.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:20.300]   And if we make it a comforting routine
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:27.140]   and a privilege to start slow,
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.020]   then I think our children will appreciate it.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.980]   - Yeah, and I know you and I both are strong believers
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.440]   in reading aloud to our kids.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.300]   So I always tried to find something really charming
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.400]   to read in January and February
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.220]   so that we could turn on our gas fireplace
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.320]   and have something warm to drink and read
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.560]   and start our day reading scripture
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.920]   and then reading something either cozy or funny
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.400]   or something that just helped us be excited
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.160]   to get back in our rhythms.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.280]   - That's really good.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.120]   I think that's good.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.520]   It entices our children to thinking
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.600]   and deep conversations again and that's a good.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   All right, so let's be super practical.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.080]   What can moms and dads who are listening to this,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.440]   who are heavily involved in homeschooling,
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.760]   what can we do to encourage ourselves?
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   How do we encourage ourselves in this dark winter season?
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.360]   - Yeah, one thing besides the prayer
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.140]   and the getting back into reading scripture
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.000]   that I've mentioned is that I was always encouraged
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   by finding a mentor whose kids were older than my kids.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.400]   It's one thing to sit around and air your frustrations
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.440]   with your friends who are in the same trenches with you
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.320]   and that's not a bad thing to do
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.240]   but it can be more helpful to do it with someone
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.060]   who's just a little farther down the road
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.720]   so you can get their wisdom.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.360]   And so I was doing that one day with one of my,
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.280]   and I've had several great mentors who I'm so grateful to.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.160]   But I was grumbling a little about some complaining
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   and some other teen habits and this wise older mama,
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.960]   even though she didn't know about my dusting analogy,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.760]   she said, "You need to wait and pray and keep working
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.860]   "just the way you're doing and they will come around.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.120]   "They are not quite who God intends them to be yet."
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.520]   And she was right, they did come around.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.200]   And so I think having a mentor is extremely important.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.880]   - I like that and I like what your mentor told you.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.320]   Give yourself some grace.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   Give yourself permission to wait on a result.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.880]   I think that our world today is the instant gratification
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.280]   and we're gonna try this plan
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.800]   because it promises instant results or fast results
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.920]   and when we don't get fast results,
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.480]   we feel like we're failures or that that plan was not for us
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.240]   or that we were definitely not for that plan.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:11.040]   And so that is real wisdom, to wait and persevere
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.560]   and give yourself grace that just because everything
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.720]   has not righted itself in the first week
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.960]   does not mean that it's not coming around.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.400]   - Yes, and we also, besides the instant gratification,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   we also can't think that it is a straight upward line
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.120]   that marks the progress of our home education.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.200]   You're tempted to think it's a graph
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.800]   that just goes right up at a constant and steady pace.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.040]   You do your work and the development comes in kind
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.100]   and it's not like that, it's more like a scatter plot.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.040]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.160]   - Ups and downs and going gangbusters for a while
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.440]   and then hitting a wall and falling flat.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.840]   - Oh, that is so good.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.160]   Okay, so listeners, you might think that's not encouraging,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.720]   that's not encouraging, but it is, okay?
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.200]   We're not, we want you to know that it's natural
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.560]   that things don't always get better, you know?
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   It really may, there may be a season or a subject
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.160]   of three steps forward, two steps back with you
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.760]   or with one of your students, one of your children.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.600]   I like that, things are sometimes a scatter plot.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.280]   Yes, that is so true and you just realize,
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.080]   but in your own life, mamas and daddies,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.240]   think about the things that you have been pursuing
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.800]   that you have wanted to get better at.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   Is it always a steady clear upward climb?
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.000]   Do you just keep getting better and better
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.860]   or do you stay at this level where you're not very good
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.860]   at something for a long time and then you have a breakthrough
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.640]   and then it unravels a little bit and then you go forward?
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.960]   I think that's really wise, that's really good.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.320]   All right, tell me some creative things
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   that your family has done to fight the doldrums, Jennifer.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.240]   I have shared before, one of my daughters,
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.820]   we hit a wall and it may have had something
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.880]   to do with the weather.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.320]   It was cold and gray, but one of the walls we hit
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.840]   was in challenge A when there was so much
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   to memorize geography-wise and spelling was not her forte
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.680]   and having to memorize the names of all of these
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.240]   world capitals and spell them correctly,
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.360]   it just took a toll on her soul.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.120]   And so we had some days where things just seemed
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.640]   very bleak to her and it wasn't just the geography,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.400]   it made everything else seem covered in gray too.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.120]   And so one thing that we did, and you'll laugh,
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.560]   Jennifer, I still have the candle of happiness.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.640]   We called it the candle of happiness and we went
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.920]   and we picked a scent that she really liked.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   It was a really warm vanilla scent and when we were having
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   a bad day, we would go, we would light the candle
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.840]   of happiness and we would sit really close to it
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.560]   and we would ease into the day and ease into our subject.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.800]   And so that sounds like a silly thing, but I will tell you
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   it made a huge difference in her outlook and I'll be honest,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:43.240]   I'm not sure if it was the candle of happiness scent
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:48.640]   that made the difference or if it was just the relationship
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.560]   that we built, I honestly think it was that she saw
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.560]   her type A, make a list, go, go, go mama be willing to say,
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:05.120]   wow, we need to take a step back and a deep breath
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.240]   and you know what, it's okay if we just sit together
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.880]   and work on this as we're able.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   I think what made the candle of happiness a success
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.640]   was that she felt heard and important and she had a partner
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.980]   and it was her mama.
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.320]   - Yeah, I think that's so good and for us in our house
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.560]   it was running the gas fireplace all winter.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.600]   We moved school mostly into that room and it just made
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.960]   cozy happy feelings and my husband got over the gas bill.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.600]   - Yes, yes.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.040]   - Wasn't sure we needed to run it as often as we thought
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   we did but it made us feel, it made winter special.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.900]   We have good memory of having the fireplace on
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.020]   and lighting some candles and eating something warm in there.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.560]   So and then I think you're right, breaking the routine
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.360]   sometimes is super important.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.240]   So one of my, I'll never forget, one of mine was doing
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.900]   a math lesson on fractions and I am a type A list making
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.160]   kind of a person and let's get through things and move on.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.100]   And so she brought me the math book and said,
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.840]   "Look, at the introduction of this lesson there is
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.680]   "this recipe for molasses cookies, can we make it?"
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.740]   And I thought, I technically know that fractions
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.160]   in a recipe are math but it feels wrong.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.200]   - Right, it feels like it will not help us get to the end
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.280]   of this lesson.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.440]   - Exactly, and we made the molasses cookies.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   I think she was in fourth grade, she's now a freshman
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.040]   in college and we still make those molasses cookies
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.720]   in our family because it was such a special yes
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.520]   that I was able to say, yes, we can stop in the middle
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.120]   of our school morning and make a cookie.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.100]   And so that, just sometimes stopping and doing something
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.680]   that they want to do is really important.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.240]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:07.240]   And I think, and it doesn't happen just in January,
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:12.200]   I think our children from time to time need to be reminded
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   that the homeschooling for us is because we're choosing
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   to invest our lives in them knowing the Lord
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.840]   and learning about his word and his world.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.120]   And we're not invested in them getting a college scholarship
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.500]   or finishing the textbook or becoming the valedictorian.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.640]   I think that they need from time to time to be reminded
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.880]   that we chose homeschooling so that we could be with them
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.800]   and we are glad to be with them.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.460]   We are glad to be learning together and they just need
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.040]   that reminder instead of we're all slogging through,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.700]   be reminded that we're all learning together.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.400]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.100]   And one of the ways that we do that without throwing out
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   the lesson plans altogether is when a subject is hard,
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.720]   like let's take the challenging cartography
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.520]   that was for that child.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.460]   And sometimes I would just set a timer and say,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.980]   you know what, I know this is hard right now,
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.620]   but it's important for us to have good habits.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.560]   And so instead of me saying, you're going to draw
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.100]   and label this entire map today, I'm going to set a timer.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.740]   And you have to judge on your child and where they are.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.500]   So, or I would do this with Latin a lot of times
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.800]   when things are hard and I'm just gonna set a timer.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.080]   And as long as you work diligently while the timer's on,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.600]   then when it's off, we are through
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.260]   with that subject for today.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.680]   No matter where we are, which was really hard for me to do,
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.220]   I feel like we need to-- - Yes, oh my gosh.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.440]   - But if I was just willing to make that deal with them,
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.400]   that if you will form these habits with me
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.360]   of working a little bit every day,
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.860]   even if we're struggling with something,
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.220]   we can't finish where we thought we should be for the day,
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:05.100]   we have cultivated the habit of doing a hard thing
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.780]   for a little bit of time every day.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.300]   So. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.960]   That's really good.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.900]   Cultivating habits are important.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.500]   So there are things, listeners,
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.020]   we all know the right things to do.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.460]   Okay, let's not pretend.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.620]   We all know that we need to get enough sleep.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.780]   We all know that we need to make good nutrition choices.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.860]   There are things that, you know,
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:38.580]   if my kids ate too much sugar or too much carbs,
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:43.580]   they were not alert, shall we say.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:49.140]   It made them want to just nap and watch movies
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.420]   or curl up with a book that was of their own choosing
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.420]   and not necessarily something that was gonna help them
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.860]   with a group conversation later.
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.180]   And so there are things that we know.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.500]   What are the things?
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.740]   What are some simple things, Jennifer,
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.660]   that you know that we all know,
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.180]   but things we need to remember
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.580]   that will help us get back on track in this new year?
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.540]   - Yeah, well, I know that like most of our listeners,
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.380]   I listen to a lot of podcasts and it's so interesting.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.580]   So when you and I were first raising our kids,
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.960]   I think we didn't have that.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.820]   We had books and friends. - Yep, yep.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.500]   - These are sources of information.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.620]   We can go to the Christian bookstore
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.800]   and get a good book on parenting,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.760]   or we could listen to some other mommas at church.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.400]   But I've been listening to a lot of podcasts
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.380]   and not surprisingly, they echo a lot
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.140]   of the practical things we've said today,
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.300]   which is that they see a national epidemic
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.700]   of kids not getting enough rest,
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.700]   not getting enough exercise,
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.920]   not getting enough time to play freely
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.420]   without being directed by others,
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.580]   and not enough responsibility and too much screen time.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.740]   So I think when you said we all know what to do,
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.540]   you're right, and so I had to really concentrate
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.800]   after the holidays on those simple things
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.820]   of an hour before bedtime is we don't,
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.920]   we can't concentrate on bedtime at bedtime,
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.180]   no matter how old we are.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.140]   We need to do the things that signal to our bodies
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.780]   that the day is winding down.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.420]   And so whether you've got teens or babies,
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.620]   that is still true, is just getting that sleep to me
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.300]   was the number one thing in January.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.140]   Let's get back on our sleep schedule
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.960]   and then eating and exercising.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.760]   So it is much harder to exercise in the winter.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.340]   And so either my kids learned to bundle up well
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.060]   and go on outside when I,
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.180]   or we figure out something to do in the house
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.420]   to move our bike.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.680]   - Right, and those are good things.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.820]   And parents, your kids are not naturally,
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:57.060]   they're not necessarily going to naturally embrace
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.500]   all of these things.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.140]   And so you are going to have to force the issue
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.540]   and set the example.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.900]   'Cause it's not just our kids that have most likely
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.620]   gotten out of good routines, it's us too.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.060]   And so we need to be getting enough rest.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.900]   We need to cut back on our screen time.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.340]   We need to eat better.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.260]   We need to exercise.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.080]   We need to go back to our good habits
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:31.020]   of folding the clothes as soon as they come out
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.980]   of the dryer.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.460]   We need to get back to the good habits.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.900]   We need to give ourselves rewards.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.580]   We need some unscripted free time as well.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.620]   What do you think, Jennifer?
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.380]   These are all great ways.
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:51.380]   You have helped us all to have good ideas
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:56.500]   for creating a reset plan for our January,
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.280]   for our homeschool and for our homes.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.660]   What does a plan like that teach our kids?
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:08.860]   - Well, hopefully, just like we're teaching them
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.220]   academic content, let's say, for lack of a better word,
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.180]   we're also teaching them how to live well.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.240]   Every time we give them responsibilities around the house
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.040]   or every time we demonstrate simple things like,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   you know what, we got off track here and we need to reset.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.900]   Then when they are older and out of our homes,
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.060]   they are equipped to know when they have gotten off track
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.460]   and to be able to reset.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.480]   And they know how to make a plan to do it
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.900]   because we are modeling that for them
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.980]   while they live at home with us.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.560]   And I think that is super important.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.220]   I mean, I know when my kids would call stress from college,
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.780]   that's exactly what we would do is talk back through
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.460]   just what you and I have talked about today,
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.140]   what you need to do to get back on track
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.680]   and make this manageable.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.760]   - Yeah, and really and truly, parents,
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:02.240]   isn't that why you're raising your children?
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   You're raising them to be, not lifetime homeschoolers,
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.500]   you're raising them to be successful adults.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.620]   You're raising them to be people who know
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.600]   how to manage their own lives well.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.580]   And so, I think you're exactly right, Jennifer,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.920]   that learning to put together for our families
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.220]   and ourselves a reset plan teaches our children
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.880]   that starting over is a good thing
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.440]   and that there are simple ways
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.280]   that we can get ourselves back on track.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.260]   That's really good.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.400]   Thank you so much.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.600]   - Can I say one last thing?
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.200]   It'll be quick. - Of course.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.680]   - As you're assessing how your first semester went
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.400]   and getting ready for the reset,
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.840]   it is super important not just to look at the things
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.960]   you feel like you're doing wrong,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.200]   but to take a moment to put your feet up and sit still
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.020]   and think about all the great fruit
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.340]   that you have already seen in the first semester
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.440]   because if you will allow yourself time to dwell on that,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.800]   you will think of many successes that you had
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.720]   and that will give you a great boost
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   to count your blessings before you try to make a new plan.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   - Oh, that's so good and this is the funny thing.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.820]   The next podcast is going to be about assessing
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.020]   as we begin a new semester.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.080]   So that is a perfect add in to that.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.500]   I also, I want to thank you, Jennifer,
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.480]   for being such an encourager
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.620]   to homeschool moms and dads everywhere.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.840]   The weary homeschool parents
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.300]   who are turning the corner into January
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.700]   have been blessed by your encouragement.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.980]   But I also want to ask you about a program
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.060]   that you are part of every week
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.580]   because I think that this might be a shot in the arm
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:56.580]   that some of our parents might like to receive in January.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.780]   Tell us a little bit about
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.780]   the Words Aptly Spoken Book Club.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.620]   - Yeah, so Lee Bortons and Tim Knotts and I
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.060]   and sometimes members of our team, including Lisa,
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.780]   will gather for an hour a week to go through
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.580]   and just discuss the books
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.020]   that are in the Classical Conversations curriculum
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.860]   and also the parent resources.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.260]   And we have a blast and we laugh and we cry
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.720]   and we have great conversations together about books.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.980]   So if you just need a break
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.620]   and you want to grab something hot to drink
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.620]   and put your feet up and listen in
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.940]   as we have these book discussions, it is a bundle of fun.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.280]   And they can be found on leebortons.com
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.980]   under the Words Aptly Spoken tab
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.440]   or you can also find them
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.460]   on her YouTube channel @leeebortons.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.900]   - That is wonderful.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.800]   And you guys would love it.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.060]   It would be a good way to reset your brain
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.880]   and your thinking for the new year.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.340]   So hopefully you guys will take advantage
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.940]   of the Words Aptly Spoken Book Club.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.700]   Thank you, Jennifer, for telling us about that
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.800]   and for being here with me today.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.140]   - Thanks for having me, Lisa.
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.060]   - All right, see you guys next week.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.640]   (gentle music)
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.700]   you
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:18.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
