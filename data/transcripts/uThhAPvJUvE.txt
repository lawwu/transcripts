[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820]   In episode 19 we talked about times when God withdraws his presence from the
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.920]   Christian, and Pastor John, there you talked about Micah 7, verses 8 and 9 in
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.500]   that context. I think it's worth revisiting this theme to ask the
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.780]   question, what does Christian hedonism have to offer a depressed Christian?
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.920]   Besides that Micah 7, 8, and 9 text, there's another beautiful text for people in
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.340]   darkness. In Psalm 139, that's the psalm, "Where shall I flee from your presence?"
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.060]   And in verse 9 it says, "If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.400]   uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me and your right
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.320]   hand shall hold me." And then it says this, "If I say, surely darkness shall cover me."
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.640]   Now notice it doesn't say, "If darkness covers me." It says, "If I say." So this is a
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.400]   person who is despairing and speaking to themselves darkness. "If I say, surely
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.640]   darkness shall cover me and the light about me be night, even the darkness is
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.360]   not dark to you. The light is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.680]   you." I think that's picturing a person who is on the brink of despair and is
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360]   saying, "Darkness is all over me. It's just covering me. I don't see any light." And
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.080]   what it's calling us to do is say, "In that experience, in that very moment,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.800]   feeling all of that desertion and all of that darkness, we say, 'This darkness is
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.560]   not dark to my God. He sees me. He knows me. He's with me. And though I can't see
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.400]   Him, He can see me and there's nothing dark about my light to Him." So I would
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.280]   say we learn these things from the precious Word of God and we preach them
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.760]   to ourselves, even though the very moment of preaching, there is almost no feeling
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.360]   for them. We assert them as true. We throw them in the devil's face. We stick him
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.120]   with the sword of the Spirit and then, like I said with regard to Psalm 40, we
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.720]   wait. We wait for the Lord. One more thing. This is a really, really
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.760]   crucial pastoral issue when it comes to dying. There's a young woman in our
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.040]   church who died. She's about 40 some years ago. She had four kids. She got
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.760]   cancer and her death was just horrible. I mean, there was nothing beautiful about
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.720]   it. It was just horrible. She basically choked on her own vomit at the end and
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.280]   everybody around her would just say, "God, please, God, please have mercy and take
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.200]   her." She had made a video for our church and we did the funeral and
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.480]   everybody wanted some explanation or some word from the pastor about saying
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.680]   something about her suffering at the end because usually we think of suffering as
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.280]   having a sanctifying effect. "Well, she's going to die in ten minutes. There's no
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.960]   life to be sanctified here. She's going to die." And what I said was the incredible
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:27.160]   triumph of her death is that she didn't curse God. In other words, she had no
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.600]   physical, emotional, mental wherewithal to sing a song. She's throwing up her own
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.840]   blood and guts and all she could do was hold on and not curse him and she
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   didn't. She just held on to him. So I think there are some moments of darkness
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.640]   where the most beautiful triumph is when Satan is probably screaming in your ear,
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.160]   "This is your God so much for your merciful God," and you just look back at
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.800]   him and say, "I'm not going to curse my God." I think that's what Job basically said to his
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.000]   wife, you know, when she said, "Curse God and die," he just said, "Look, we're going to
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   receive evil and good at the hand of the Lord. We're not going to curse him."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.840]   That is a powerful testimony. Pastor John, thank you, and thank you for listening to
