[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the eleventh verse in that third
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.280]   chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, which has been read to us. The eleventh verse
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.640]   in the third chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians. "For other foundation
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:34.560]   can no man lay than that is laid, or which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ."
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.760]   Now this great apostle came to write these words in this first section of this somewhat
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:52.720]   long letter which he wrote to the church at Corinth because he was dealing here with a
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:01.760]   problem that had arisen in that church. The church at Corinth, like so many other churches,
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.560]   had come into being as the result of a visit that the apostle had paid to that city. There
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.800]   was no church there, no Christianity there before he arrived. But as a result of his
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.880]   preaching, a number of people had been converted and had become Christians, and he formed them
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.360]   and established them as a church. And it was a particularly brilliant church. But unfortunately,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.800]   after the passage of some time, difficulties had arisen in the church. And one of the difficulties
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.280]   was caused by certain other preachers and teachers who had visited the church and whose
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.800]   message had deviated from that which had been preached by the great apostle himself. And
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.760]   the result was the church was in a state of trouble and confusion. Factions, divisions
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.040]   had arisen within the church, forming themselves around these various preachers. Some said,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.560]   'I am of Paul', others said, 'I am of Apollo', others said, 'I am Cephas'. They'd formed
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.840]   these groups and factions around their favourite preachers, as it were, and the whole life
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.640]   of the church was being threatened by these divisions. And so the apostle writes his letter
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.400]   to them. He's heard about this and he's very troubled and concerned, and he wants us to
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.480]   put them right with regard to this matter. And what he really says is this. He says,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.760]   'I wouldn't take any notice of this matter if it were merely something superficial, something
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:57.120]   peripheral, with regard to the Christian faith'. But he said, 'Unfortunately, it isn't. It
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.080]   is something that affects the very foundation, the whole basis of the faith'. And that is
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.520]   why he feels compelled to deal with it. He's already told them in the first chapter something
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:20.000]   like this. He said, 'Christ sent me, not to baptise, but to preach the gospel, not with
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.200]   wisdom of words'. That means philosophy. 'Lest the cross of Christ should be made of none
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.360]   effect'. The trouble about this false teaching was that it was affecting the view of the
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:45.240]   cross of Christ, the very foundation and basis of the whole of the Christian position. So
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:54.480]   in other words, he's calling their attention here to something which is foundational, elemental,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.680]   something that concerns the whole origin and basis of what we believe. And it's because
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.040]   of that I'm calling your attention to it tonight. This really is calling us to consider the
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.480]   most important question that confronts every one of us who's born into this world. And
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:26.280]   the question is this. Have we got a foundation to our life? I believe this is the most urgent
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.840]   problem, the most urgent question facing every one of us and facing everybody in the world
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:41.480]   at this very moment. Now I may take very little time in demonstrating to you or reminding
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.560]   you of the all-important other foundation. If the foundation is not right, nothing is
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:58.000]   going to be right. And in order to remind you of that, let me tell you about an incident
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.960]   that I remember reading in the newspaper a number of years back. It was an account of
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:15.360]   a certain man and his wife who had had a house built. They had decided many years before
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.240]   that when the time came for them to retire, that they'd build a house for themselves
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.840]   in a certain spot. They had always liked it, they liked the view, the prospect, and it
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.880]   did greatly appeal to them, so they decided that when they came to retire, they'd build
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.760]   a house there. And the time came, and they called in the services of a builder, and he
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.800]   had built a house for them according to their specification. And the time came that the
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.360]   man and his wife moved into the house, and they were very pleased with it and enjoying
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.480]   their life in their new home in this delectable spot. But after a few months, to their surprise
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.960]   and amazement, a crack appeared in one of the walls. And of course, they sent for the
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.760]   builder. And the builder came, and he looked at it and examined it, he said, "This is
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.640]   all right, this is nothing serious. I can plaster it over and paint it over, you'll
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.120]   be all right." They said, "Nothing." And he did so. And they went on, everything was
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.520]   all right, but after another few months, a crack appeared in another wall. Well, there
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.320]   was still more surprise. And again, they sent for the builder. And he came, and again, he
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.120]   did exactly the same thing. He said, "This is all right, just a crack. I'll plaster
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.600]   it over, paint it, it'll be all right, don't worry." And he did so, and on they went,
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.640]   but then a crack appeared in another wall, and on and on it went. So at last, the man,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.000]   of course, and his wife, became impatient with this builder, and they called in the
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   medical services of a qualified architect. And the architect came, and he met and examined
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.080]   the structure. And he shook his head, and he said, "Of course, the trouble here is
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:04.040]   not in the walls. The trouble with this house is that he didn't lay a proper foundation.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.960]   There isn't an adequate foundation here, and it's because of that you're getting
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:15.760]   these cracks. And you'll go on getting them until something is done about the foundation."
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:22.840]   Now there I see a great parable with respect to life at the present time. Our world is
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:31.400]   full of problems. Almost every day you read about some new problem, some new difficulty.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.840]   The world is in great trouble. And this seems to me to be the tragedy, that those who are
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:45.480]   responsible for government and law and order and so on, so closely resemble the builder
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.600]   in my anecdote. They all come along and say, "It's all right," and they have an instant
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.680]   solution, dealing with this crack or that crack. "Quite all right," they say, "it
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.240]   can easily be put right." Instant solution, instant politics, no difficulty. And each
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:11.440]   man is concentrating on the particular crack. Some say that all our problems are political.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.080]   Others say that they're all economic. Others say that they're all sociological. Others
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.920]   say they're all moral, and so on. Others say it's a problem of ignorance and education.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.440]   We have a whole series of experts on particular cracks. And they all say they can put it right,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.840]   they plaster the door and put on a bit of paint, everything's going to be all right.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:41.960]   But unfortunately, the cracks keep on appearing. And the world tonight is in a state of very
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:49.440]   grave crisis. What's the matter? What's the cause of it all? Well, the message of
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:58.640]   the Bible is to say this to us, that there's one common cause to all the problems. As there
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.600]   was one common cause for all these various cracks that appeared in that man's house,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:14.760]   so there is one common cause for all the ills and troubles and problems that are perplexing
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:24.360]   the human race at this very moment. And the trouble is the absence of a solid and a true
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:31.760]   foundation to life. Now that is the great case which is made by the Bible. It's the
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.280]   thing to which the apostle is calling attention here.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:42.440]   And I want very hurriedly to show you how this is true. In every relevant department
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:49.760]   of life in this country of ours, at this present moment, it doesn't matter what realm you
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.520]   look at, you'll find that this is the case. Take the realm of what is called philosophy,
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.400]   thought. It's very popular. Many people, most people perhaps, have left the Christian
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.040]   church during this century because they say they turned to philosophy. These great philosophers,
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.040]   Bedford and Russell and others, these are the men they say, these are the men who lead
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.760]   us and give us understanding. Well now there was a time when the philosophers were fairly
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:27.200]   clear in their ideas and they could help us up to a point because of the clarity of their
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:35.640]   understanding. But you know that's no longer the case. Everything is in a state of flux.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.200]   I remember a time, I'm old enough to remember a time, when we were told there was an essential
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.960]   difference between matter and spirit. But you know today they're telling us there's
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:54.920]   no such thing as matter. Everything is energy, movement. They used to talk about laws, laws
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:02.520]   of Newton and various other laws. They don't do that now. It's relativity, probability.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:10.440]   Can't be certain or sure of anything. So you see in the realm of pure thought there
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:18.520]   is no solid foundation. Everything's in a state of flux. Or take the realm of politics.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.800]   Again I'm old enough to remember when there were clear divisions and distinctions between
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:31.200]   parties and each had their principles on which they stood and which they advocated. But not
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.600]   to be unduly critical. Surely that's no longer the case. The difference between the
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.480]   parties is becoming less and less and you have divisions amongst them all and there
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.840]   is uncertainty and the whole danger today is the problems are not solved in terms of
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:53.320]   great foundational principles. But as I say some immediate action, dealing with particular
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:12:00.560]   problems as they arise. And nobody seems to be troubling to take an overall view and to
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:09.520]   rediscover foundational principles. Everything again is in a state of flux and of uncertainty.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:16.600]   Opportunism, simply getting over an immediate crisis and the great principles are very little
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:24.760]   heard of at the present time. And so it is I think in most other realms. I gather from
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.880]   my reading and talking to men that it's the same in the realm of industry. That there
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:38.240]   is this same uncertainty, this same insecurity with regard to basic principles. And of course
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.840]   when you come to the realm of morals and of conduct and of behavior, it's still more
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:51.800]   obvious, isn't it? Tragically obvious. Look at the troubles today in the moral realm,
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.480]   the social and the moral realm. Look at the mounting problems. I'm not only thinking
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:05.920]   of crime and things like that but the breakdown of marriage and the idea of a home. All these
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:13.640]   sanctities which have made life great and worth living in the past. We're in an age
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:19.560]   which is given the name of the designation of permissiveness. What's it mean? It means
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:28.040]   this, that people no longer recognize such a thing as morality at all. Fifty years ago
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   most people would agree that there was a difference between right and wrong and good and evil,
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.560]   moral and immoral. That's no longer the case. The problem today is not the problem
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:46.000]   of immorality. It's the problem of amorality, non-morality, that people don't recognize
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.320]   such a category as morality at all. And the argument is, if I want a thing why shouldn't
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   I do it? Every man did that which was right in his own eyes. If I want to do a thing why
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:03.680]   shouldn't I do it? Nothing matters except my desire and the gratification of my immediate
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:11.520]   desire. Isn't that the position? No fixed principles, no great foundations which are
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.640]   recognized by everybody. And then, to be honest, and we've got to be honest, the times are
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:24.600]   so desperate. When you come to the realm of the church and of religion, I feel the same
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:31.440]   is true. And that is why Christianity counts for so little in this country tonight. Let's
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.480]   be frank and honest. I'm not surprised that the majority of people are outside the Christian
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.560]   church. I think I can tell you why they are outside. They're outside for this reason,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.400]   that they say, "What is Christianity?" They say, "I don't know. I listen to the
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:53.040]   television and the wireless and I hear men speaking in the name of Christianity and contradicting
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.200]   one another quite blankly. Some say that Jesus the Lesser isn't the eternal Son of God,
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:03.640]   others say he's only a man, but they all call themselves Christians." And so on.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:10.560]   The great principles seem to be forgotten. And people are more concerned about an artificial,
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:17.800]   superficial unity than they are about the great foundations of the faith which were
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.520]   brought to light in the early church and at the time of the Protestant Reformation in
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:32.040]   all the really great periods in the history of this country. Unfortunately, in every realm
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:39.880]   there is this state of flux and of uncertainty, the absence of great foundational principles.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.920]   And this is why life is as it is. And this is why so many people, and I can understand
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.000]   them in a superficial sense, so many people say, "What's the good of anything? Let
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.360]   us eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die." I'm particularly sorry for the young
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.280]   people at the present time. Here they come into this troubled world and they say, "You
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.800]   older people, with all your claims, you've landed us in a world where you've already
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.560]   had two world wars in this one century, and you've landed us with these teeming problems.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:19.280]   What are we to do? Where are we to turn?" And everything is uncertain. And so I say,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.600]   people are in a state of utter confusion.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.960]   Now, lest somebody may think that I'm simply voicing my own opinions, let me read to you
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:35.360]   some words written by a very distinguished professor of sociology, Professor Daniel Bell
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:43.200]   of Chicago, who was a guest professor in Cambridge during this present year. This man's not
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:50.520]   a Christian, but this is what he wrote recently. "For the rest, the British economy is in
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:57.560]   crisis." And we know that, don't we? There is a crisis in the realm of economy and of
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:06.600]   finance and of industry. The British economy is in crisis. Every philosophical position
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:17.880]   is in crisis, and British intellectuals of all colors are wandering aimlessly. Now there's
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.800]   the opinion of a man who's not a Christian, but who's a very able man and an observer
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.640]   of society and of the trends in society, an expert on what is called sociology. And that
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   is how he puts it, and it is, unfortunately, the simple truth.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:42.920]   Well now then, all this you see simply demonstrates the basic fundamental statement of the Bible,
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:53.680]   which is this, that without a foundation, life inevitably becomes completely chaotic.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:59.600]   That's the basic statement, that all our troubles are due to that. Of course, the tendency
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   is for one group to blame another, not realizing that the trouble is in all the groups. The
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.360]   trouble isn't in any one section of society or in any one realm of the realms that I've
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:19.280]   been mentioning. It's in them all. As Daniel Bell says, there is this common absence of
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:25.200]   a foundation, an understanding of basic truth and basic principle.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:32.280]   Now this, I say, is the great statement of the Bible. It's the introduction to its message.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:40.800]   But then it goes on to make a second statement, and the second statement is this, that man,
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:52.520]   by his own unaided efforts, will never be able to provide or to make this needed foundation.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:19:00.280]   Other foundations, says the apostle, can no man lay. Man can't do it. Now this is very
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:07.840]   important. This is an essential part of the message of the true Christian faith. Man needs
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:16.440]   a foundation. Without it, his life becomes a chaos. Secondly, do what he will. Man can
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:25.400]   never make or create or establish the needed foundation for the whole of life. Other foundations
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:33.200]   can no man lay. Now the question is, is this true? Can I demonstrate this? Well, unfortunately,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:40.080]   I can't. And I'm going to do it for you in this way. I'm going to prove the truth of
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:50.240]   what the apostle says by showing you that what we call civilization has ended in failure.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:57.040]   Civilization. What is civilization? Well, it's the great word today, isn't it? We're all
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:05.160]   interested in civilization. You saw the famous lectures of Lord Clark, Civilization. And
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:11.960]   it was a wonderful story, wasn't it? These marvellous achievements of men, these magnificent
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:18.480]   buildings, the ruins of which you can see in Greece and in Rome and so on, these magnificent
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:26.720]   paintings, the great cathedral, civilization. But you know, civilization doesn't stop at
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:35.560]   art and literature and culture in that sense. Civilization, of course, includes this thing
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:43.600]   which Paul calls here wisdom of men, human wisdom, what we call philosophy. You see,
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.080]   these Greeks who lived and taught before Christ ever came into this world, they were very
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:57.400]   great men, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, and the rest. And as thinking men, they began
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:05.200]   to face the facts. They said, "Here we are in this world, and well, why is it as it is?
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.440]   Why have we got problems and trouble?" And they began to think and to reason and to work
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:18.480]   out their teaching and to propagate it and to offer their solutions. Now, this is civilization.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:25.000]   But you see, it was they who introduced what we call politics. They invented the term.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   They introduced all this. They began science, Euclid, Pythagoras, and all these other men.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.640]   These were all Greeks who had lived and taught before Christ ever came into this world at
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.560]   all. And so, you see, there has been this great effort on the part of men to improve
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:48.840]   this world. They set out to improve the mind and the understanding. They had ideas about
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:56.080]   the ideal state. And they outlined this. We talk about utopia. It was the Greeks who introduced
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.920]   that term and that idea. They said, "You know, we're not all meant to be miserable.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.520]   We're meant to be happy and to live harmoniously together." And they drew up blueprints for
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.040]   utopia. "Do this," they said, "and all's going to be well." And so you've got a blueprint
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:18.320]   for utopia. But the question is this, isn't it? Have we got utopia? These ideas have continued
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.600]   throughout the centuries. Men have rarely believed that you could legislate in a kind
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.720]   of perfection, that by passing acts of parliament, giving more education and knowledge and culture,
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.800]   giving more money, better housing, and so on and so forth, that you could make a perfect
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:42.600]   state. This is civilization. Thank God for all the benefits we've had and all the improvements
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:50.200]   which we rejoice in. Thank God for it all. But the vital question is this. Are the problems
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:57.760]   solved? I've already given you the answer. The world is in great trouble. Men in the
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:05.240]   last century thought that as the result of education and increasing travelling facilities
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.280]   with the steam engine and then the internal combustion engine, that there'd never be
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.600]   another war. They said war is due to the fact that people don't know one another. If only
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.680]   they met a new one another, there'd never be any more war. And yet we've had these two
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.360]   devastating world wars in this century with all our knowledge and travel. The world is
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:29.320]   in a state of grave crisis tonight. What's it mean? Well, there's only one answer. It
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:36.880]   is the failure of civilization. It is the failure of men. We can man people on the surface
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:43.320]   of the moon, but we can't live together. This is the whole tragedy. All our advances
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:49.760]   are in the realm of technology. But when you come to the basic questions of a man living
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:55.320]   happily with his wife and bringing up a family in a state of love and all these other things
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:02.040]   that make life worth living, we are disastrous failure. And the problems are mounting up
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:09.800]   almost daily round and about us. The apostles said it. Other foundation can no man lay.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:16.360]   In spite of this unrivaled effort of the human race over so many centuries and especially
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:24.480]   the last hundred years, the world as I say tonight is in this state of terrible crisis.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:33.120]   Other foundation can no man lay. Well now then, here is the question, isn't it? Why
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:42.840]   is this? Why have all the great endeavors of mankind come as it were to nothing? And
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:48.920]   the Bible alone gives us the answer to that question. And its answer is roughly this.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.880]   Here's the general answer. The main trouble with all of us by nature is that we're in
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.400]   too much of a hurry always. We say it's quite simple. It can be put right. We've
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:06.640]   all passed through this phase. In our adolescence and afterwards we were idealistic and optimistic.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.360]   We said our fathers were fools. They didn't realize what was the matter of it. If only
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.480]   they'd realized they could have put it right. We are going to put the world right. Doesn't
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   last very long, does it? And when we become middle-aged we tend to become a little bit
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.440]   cynical. And when we get a bit older we feel hopeless. What's the use of anything? Let's
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:32.960]   make the best of it while we are here. Cynicism and despair. Why? Well because you see we're
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:40.360]   in too much of a hurry. Now our Lord surely has settled this question once and forever.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:45.160]   In the famous parable that he spoke at the end of the Sermon on the Mount. Do you remember
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.600]   it? It's a parable about two men building a house each. I always like to think that
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:57.440]   these two men were friends and that they had agreed years before that when they came to
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:04.080]   retire they'd build a house each but they'd be next door to one another. They were such
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.960]   great friends and they liked the same spot. So they both put up a house. And the two houses,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:16.600]   if you looked at them, you'd say they're absolutely identical. Same size, same shape,
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.760]   chimneys in the same position, same number of windows. You'd look at them and say well
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:29.720]   there really is no difference between those houses at all. But there was one difference.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:36.360]   One difference is this, that in the construction of the houses the first men had finished building
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:42.080]   his house long before the second men. Why? Well the first men said if you want to have
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.880]   a house and a home what you do of course is you start building. But the second men instead
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:54.960]   of putting down his stones or his bricks, he seemed to be digging down. And the first
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.680]   men was very amused at this. He said look at my friend. He told everybody, look at my
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.800]   friend. He wants a house like I do. But instead of building as I'm doing, he's digging down.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:11.600]   Don't you go in down when you want to go up? Wonderful joke. It was a standing joke. However,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:17.200]   the second men eventually finished his house. So they both went to live in their houses
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.840]   next door to one another and there they were enjoying life. But unfortunately that wasn't
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:29.320]   the end of the story. According to our Lord this is what happened. The rain descended,
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:37.920]   the floods came, and the wind blew and beat upon that house, the house of the first men.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   And it fell. And great was the fall thereof. The same thing exactly happened to the house
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:51.680]   of the second men. The rain descended and the floods came and the wind blew and beat
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:28:01.640]   upon that house. But it fell not. Why? Because it was founded upon a rock. No difference
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:09.080]   on the surface. But there was a difference in the foundation. And when the trials come,
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.720]   it makes all the difference. You see the trouble with the first men was he was in a hurry.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:20.860]   That's a house. No problem, no difficulty, just build. Don't waste time with foundations.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:28.040]   What are principles matter? Immediate results. This is what we want. And so the first men
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.320]   ends in disaster. That's the great trouble with all of us. But you know, it isn't only
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.840]   a general problem, difficulty. There are many, many particular difficulties. Let me put it
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.680]   to you like this very hurriedly. What do we all want? We all want to be happy. It's
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:52.000]   a legitimate desire. We are not meant to be miserable and unhappy and always fighting
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.560]   against problems and difficulties. Well then, what do we want? Well, we want to build a
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   great building, a great edifice in which we can house all the things that we desire, the
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:11.680]   things that have got to be satisfied before we can have a really full life. What have
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:18.520]   we got to cater for in our building? Well, here are some of the things. The first is,
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:28.120]   what is man? Isn't it amazing that in the midst of all our problems, very few people
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:34.200]   trouble to ask that question. They're all concerned about the problems of man, but they
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:40.920]   don't stop to ask, what is man? And you see, it's the fundamental question, isn't it?
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:49.200]   Because your view of man is going to determine how you treat the various problems. For instance,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:56.280]   the common view of men today is that man is just an animal. Man, this is an animal that's
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.760]   evolved from some primitive slime and he's come up to the earth. He's nothing but an
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:06.880]   animal. And here he is in this world to eat and drink and indulge his sex. That's man.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:13.000]   Well, very well. If man is an animal and nothing but an animal, you mustn't be surprised if
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.040]   he behaves like an animal. You mustn't lift up your hands in horror of permissiveness
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.240]   and pornography and all these other things. If man is only an animal, well then surely
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.640]   he'll behave as one, and you shouldn't complain. So you see, this is a fundamental
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:39.120]   question. What is man? And the simple truth is this, that there is no answer to that question
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:46.800]   which is satisfactory except the answer given in this book. So man fails to answer this
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.080]   fundamental question.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:31:00.280]   God. Every man in this world has some vague sense of some supreme being. If you go and
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:08.120]   visit the most remote places in the world and the most primitive savages, you'll find
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.160]   some of them in Northwest America, you'll find them in Central Australia and Central
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:21.440]   Africa. Utterly illiterate, but they've all got a sense of a supreme being. And these
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:28.440]   great Greek philosophers to whom I'm referring, they all have this. When Paul visited Athens,
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.800]   he found there was a temple with this inscription, "To the unknown God." Man has a feeling that
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:41.040]   there is some power above himself, some influence, and the great quest has been to try to find
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:48.440]   God. But man can't find God. Paul has reminded these Corinthians in chapter 1 that the world
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:54.320]   by wisdom knew not God. They can seek after him, but they can't find him. And they're
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   no nearer to finding him today than they were in the first century. They failed there. What
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   else do we need to know?
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:07.080]   Well, the next question is this. What is life? What are we for in this world? What are we
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.880]   supposed to be doing with this life? We find ourselves in the world. Well, what's it all
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:19.240]   about? How am I to live? It's a basic fundamental question. As I say, most people don't even
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:26.040]   face it. They just do what they feel like doing and they go on with no sense of responsibility,
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:31.200]   claiming that we have a right to enjoy ourselves in our own way. Is that life? Has it got any
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:39.720]   purpose? Has it got any object at all? The modern man can't answer it any more than men
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.640]   have been able to answer it in the past. What else do I need to know? Well, I need to know
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:54.360]   this. Shakespeare spoke about these slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and they
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:01.200]   come to all of us. We haven't lived very long before we get problems, perhaps disappointment
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:10.040]   in love, the treachery of some trusted friend, illness, failure in an exam, failure in a
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:18.680]   career or in a profession, loss of money, ill health, serious illness of a loved one,
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:26.200]   death of a loved one, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:33.120]   Now we all are aware of these and you know, talking in terms of putting up a building,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.480]   this is what these constructional engineers have to be so careful about with these skyscrapers
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.640]   that they're putting up today, isn't it? They go down and dig a deep foundation. Why?
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.640]   Well, they say we've got to put up these massive walls and a heavy roof on the top
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.120]   of the lot, but then there are the stresses and the strains, the gales and the wind and
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.000]   the hurricanes and the rain. The walls have got to stand up to that. They have to make
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.880]   their calculations. And it's the same with life. But men don't seem to be able to cater
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:08.240]   for this. That's why people turn to drink and become alcoholics. That's why they're
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.760]   turning to drugs. That's why they rush to pleasure. Get away from it. Go to the bingo
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:21.040]   hall, some entertainment, switch on the television, terrible news comes, switch on the comedian,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.760]   anything to get rid of it, not facing it, because they can't face it. Isn't this
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:34.960]   the reality about life today? And then another question. It's bound to come. We can't
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:43.840]   evade it. We can't avoid it. Death. Every one of us has got to die. And yet the simple
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:53.080]   truth is that most people never think about it at all. This absolute certainty. A modern
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:58.840]   man is no more able to cater for death than men were a thousand years ago or two thousand
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:04.920]   years ago. Let me prove it to you. There's a great German at the beginning of the last
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:10.000]   century, perhaps the greatest philosopher, certainly the greatest dramatist and poet
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.400]   that Germany's ever produced. His name was Goethe. And Goethe was a great man. He was
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.240]   not a Christian, but he was a great man and a great thinker, and as I say, a great poet
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:26.480]   and dramatist. And he rejected Christianity. But the time came when Goethe, like everybody
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:33.000]   else, had to die. And there he was on his deathbed. And do you know what he was saying,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:40.440]   crying? It's in his biography. There, face to face with death, he was crying, "More
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:48.160]   light, more light." He didn't know where he was going. It was an impenetrable darkness.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:54.560]   So men, you see, with all this culture and civilization and development, he can't cater
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:03.600]   for this inevitable, ineluctable fact of death, which we've all got to face. Man's a failure.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:10.320]   But he doesn't even stop at that. Did you notice what was read to us? Paul writing says
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.760]   this, "Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid." Then he says, "If
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:21.920]   any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:29.440]   every man's work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it." What's he
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:38.800]   talking about? He's talking about the day of judgment. For death is not the end. It
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:46.920]   is appointed unto all men once to die. But after death, the judgment. We've all got
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.200]   to stand before God and give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:58.760]   bad. The day shall declare it. But people don't stop to consider this. They have no
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:04.360]   idea of any day ever, any sense of responsibility. You know, they're like another man I heard
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:10.480]   of, a man who happened to live in a hilly, mountainous part of Wales. And he had felt
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.520]   for many years he'd like to put up an extra building. And at last he did so. And he was
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.720]   very pleased with himself and the building. But poor man, he was having tea with his wife
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.240]   one afternoon, and there was a knock at the front door. And he went to the door, and there
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.400]   was a man standing there. He didn't know who he was, and asked what his business was.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.320]   And the man at the door said, "I hear that you put up a new building here." "Yes,"
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.360]   he said, "I'd thought of doing so for many years, and I've done it." I thought,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.680]   "There it is. I know my friend," said the man. But he said, "I happen to be an inspector
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   from the Town and Country Planning. And you know, your building does not conform to the
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:52.520]   regulation. We stipulate that a certain kind of building must be put up in this part of
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.560]   the country." Well, I thought that this was all a... I know, said the man, but it,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.880]   you know, it isn't what you think. It's the Town and Country Planning Act that matters.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:09.200]   And that man was made to pull down his building. The day of the clergy, the inspector arrived.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.480]   And whether you like this or not, or whether we agree with it or not, the great message
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.680]   of the Bible is that every one of us will have to stand in judgment before God. Death
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:29.560]   is not the end. Man has a soul which is immortal, and he goes on and faces his maker.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:35.280]   Well, now, it's because, you see, that man fails to cater for all these things which
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:44.000]   are so vital and essential that he fails completely. He can't establish a foundation that is big
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.960]   and solid and strong enough to maintain a great edifice in which all these things will
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:59.120]   have their appropriate places. Other foundation can no man lay than that which has been laid.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:10.640]   Man at his best has failed to solve his problems. But thank God the message doesn't end there.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:22.280]   Other foundation can no man lay than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:27.520]   This is the message of Christianity. It does show us our failure, for no man becomes a
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.240]   Christian as long as he thinks he can succeed. The only people who turn to Christ are those
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:37.720]   who realize the truth about themselves and about their world. They're like the prodigal.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:42.440]   You have to come to yourself and realize what a fool you are. Sitting there in the foreign
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.720]   country with the swine and eating the husks that are meant to feed swine, realizing what
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:53.880]   a fool you are, he came to himself. And so we have to bring one another to ourselves
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:02.040]   and realize our failure. But then, the message of the gospel. While man fails to provide
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:11.240]   the foundation, there is a foundation. Jesus Christ. Now you notice what the apostle says.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:18.400]   He's the only foundation. No other. And this is my message tonight. There is literally
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:25.320]   no other hope for any individual in this world tonight except this gospel. Try any other
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:31.160]   one. We've tried them all. They've all failed. Not only the culture, civilization
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:36.680]   I've been talking about. All your Eastern religions, they're all hopeless. The only
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:41.640]   hope they give you is that you may come back in many reincarnations and then suddenly dissolve
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:51.200]   into nothingness, hopelessness, despair. No foundation. There's only one. Jesus Christ.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:58.400]   And of course a foundation is something definite and solid. It's because the Christian church
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:05.000]   is no longer preaching Jesus Christ, that she is as she is. While men calling themselves
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.920]   Christian write books called the myth of God incarnate, well you can't expect anybody
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   to listen to them. There's no hope. There's no gospel. All you've got to believe is what
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.880]   these clever fellows are trying to say. And they contradict one another. That's not gospel.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:26.720]   There's no hope. Jesus Christ. A foundation is definite. You can't build a house on a
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.880]   jellyfish or on jelly. Of course you can't. You must have something solid and discreet
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.920]   and definite, length-breath-wide-depth. Here it is. And it is Jesus Christ. Jesus, he was
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   a man. Yes, but he wasn't only a man. Christ. The Christ of God. The eternal Son of God.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:53.240]   The great message of the incarnation. How the Son of God came into human nature unto
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:42:00.280]   himself and was born from the Virgin's womb. The great miracle of the incarnation. It's
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:06.840]   all there in him. Jesus Christ. And it's definite. And not merely that he came and
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:13.360]   he taught, but that especially he went to the cross on Calvary's Hill to bear the punishment
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:20.920]   of our sin. God is a holy and a righteous being. There's no darkness in God. God is
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:27.760]   light and in him is no darkness at all. God can't wink and pretend he hasn't seen something.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.840]   That's what we do and we call it justice. It's not justice. It's not straight. It's
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:41.120]   a sham. It's pretend. God is light and in him is no darkness at all. And sin must be
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.640]   punished because man's a responsible being. And if man were punished it would be the end
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:53.440]   of him. So God has worked out this way of salvation. He sends his only Son into the
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.360]   world as a man and he lays our sins upon him and punishes him instead of us and offers
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:08.440]   us free pardon and forgiveness. That's the only foundation. And you see it has been laid.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.920]   We are not waiting for something that's going to happen. We look back to something
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:18.000]   that did happen on a cross on Calvary's Hill in the first century. There was the solution
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.360]   once and forever. The only solution. God's own Son bearing our sins in his own body on
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:34.120]   the tree, dying to save us, to give us a new life and a new hope and a new everything and
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:40.240]   eventually to present us faultless to God in the glory which we shall spend with him.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:47.360]   It has been laid once and forever. And though nearly two thousand years have passed since
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.840]   then man has not been able to add anything to it at all. He hasn't helped us in any
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:44:00.280]   one of the basic problems to the slightest extent. It is only Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   Nothing else. The only foundation.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:10.000]   But before I close I must ask a question that may well be on the mind of someone listening
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:18.600]   to me at this moment. And the question is this. Are you really saying, says the questioner,
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:29.600]   that that old gospel of yours is still adequate in 1977, in this last quarter of this twentieth
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:36.880]   century, with all our scientific and technological advances and all our great increases? Are
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:43.440]   you telling us that that is still adequate and that that is the only foundation? It's
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.880]   a perfectly fair question. And I am ready to answer it. And I can answer it. It is still
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:58.400]   adequate. And this alone is adequate. And you know I can prove it to you in this way.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:05.840]   I can prove it to you by using a very modern analogy. As I was saying a short while ago,
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:11.760]   you've noticed in, when they put up these enormous high buildings, you notice how careful
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:19.880]   they are to build these deep, strong, solid foundations because of the height of the building
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:28.320]   and so on. Very well. I see a parable there. I remember a time when men used to put up
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:34.360]   some sort of a building. There didn't pay much double attention to the foundation. They'd
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:41.920]   take in a wheelbarrow full of earth and of stones and so on and build. But then if they
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:49.360]   had to put up a more solid building, they'd use mortar to bind the stones together instead
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:56.560]   of earth. Bigger buildings, stronger foundation. Then they advanced from mortar to what they
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.480]   called cement. And cement was so much stronger than mortar. Then they went beyond cement
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:10.400]   to what was called concrete. Ah, they said, this is it. Concrete is really solid. And
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.680]   if you want a really strong foundation, you must use concrete. Have you noticed the new
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:24.440]   term in connection with these high buildings? What they're talking about now is reinforced
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:31.040]   concrete. Even concrete isn't strong enough. You've got to enforce it, reinforce it. With
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:37.040]   metal, you've got to put some steel into it. To strengthen even the concrete, you've
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:44.040]   got to put some metal into it to bind it all together to carry the weight of these enormous
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:52.440]   structures. What a perfect parable of what we have in Jesus Christ.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.600]   Many a time I've been asked the question by young people, and this is the question.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:05.360]   They say, you know, there's one thing I don't understand. Believing what you say, that God
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:12.080]   created a man called Adam, and that he fell and sinned against God and brought chaos into
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:22.040]   the world. Why didn't God immediately create another perfect man? Why all this long interval?
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:28.800]   And you see, the answer is quite simple. If God had created another man, he would have
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:35.000]   failed. He would have fallen in exactly the same way as Adam. Adam was a perfect man.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.520]   He was made in the image and likeness of God. There was no evil in him at all. He was put
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.520]   in a place called paradise where there was nothing against him. All was in his favor.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:51.920]   But it was there that the perfect man failed. The enemy was too strong for him. So if God
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:48:00.280]   had created another perfect man, he would have failed in exactly the same way. Man alone
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:10.120]   is not. What is the incarnation? It's this. It is the Godhead reinforcing the humanity.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:17.600]   Christ is man, yes, but he's Godman. The Godhead has taken humanity unto itself, reinforcing
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:27.320]   it, making it strong enough. And that is why Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ alone, is the
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:36.760]   only adequate foundation. He's the start of a new humanity, the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:43.880]   And he, and he alone, solves our every problem. He answers our every question. Look at the
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:49.160]   questions I've put to you. What is man? You want to know what man is? Look at Jesus of
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:55.720]   Nazareth. That's man. That's what we're all meant to be like.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:01.840]   Second question. How can I know God? It's our greatest need, every one of us in the
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.920]   world tonight, to know God. Christ said in his great high priestly prayer just before
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:17.720]   his death, "O righteous Father, the world has not known thee, but I have known thee."
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.440]   That's the trouble with the world. That's why you've got lawlessness. That's why you've
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.960]   got indiscipline in the home, in the school, in industry, everywhere throughout society,
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:34.560]   in every class without distinction. Indiscipline. Why? No supreme lawgiver. They don't know
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:41.840]   God. How can a man know God? Can a man, by searching, find out God? He can't. The philosophers
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:48.800]   have already failed. There's only one who can introduce us to God, Jesus Christ. No
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:55.880]   man hath seen God at any time. The only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:03.280]   has declared him. Christ said, "He who has seen me hath seen the Father. I am the light
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:09.080]   of the world, and he alone is. What do I do about my sins, my failures? I can't get rid
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:17.160]   of them." He's born them in his own body on the tree. He's paid the penalty. God was in
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:23.640]   Christ reconciling the world unto himself. How can I make a fresh start? I take my New
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:29.360]   Year resolutions. I always break them. I need a new nature. Where can I get it? Christ can
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:36.680]   give me a new nature, a new birth. This is the need. What do I do fighting the devil?
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:42.000]   The devil's too strong for me. I go down. Here's one who's conquered the devil, and
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:49.220]   the only one who's ever conquered the devil, mastered it. What do I do about the slings
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:57.960]   and arrows of outrageous fortune? He alone can help me. Nobody else can help me. He has
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:05.120]   promised never to leave me nor forsake me. He alone gives me explanations and understanding
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:15.720]   and enables me to go on resolutely without faltering. What about death, the last enemy?
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:23.040]   He's conquered it. He's risen in glorious resurrection. He's brought life and immortality
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:29.360]   to light through his gospel. The only one, the first begotten from among the dead, he's
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:34.640]   taken the sting out of him. So that I can say with this apostle in the 15th chapter
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:40.000]   of this first epistle to the Corinthians, "Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.080]   where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law. But
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:53.160]   thanks be unto God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." What about
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:52:00.760]   standing before God in the judgment? It's all right, says the apostle Jude in his epistle.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:09.000]   He's not only able to keep us from falling, but to present us faultless before the presence
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:19.240]   of his glory with exceeding joy. My every need is satisfied. My questions are answered.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:33.360]   My problems are solved by Jesus Christ and by him alone. Other foundation can no man
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:47.520]   lay than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ. Are you on the foundation? Can
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:58.240]   you say from your heart, "My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' love and righteousness.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:08.600]   I dare not trust the sweetest frail feeling, but wholly lean on Jesus' name, on Christ
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:20.360]   the solid rock. I stand. All other ground is sinking sand." Or as the hymn we're going
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:29.280]   to sing puts it, "Things of thee has spoken Zion, city of our God. He whose word cannot
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:38.680]   be broken, from thee for his own abode on the rock of ages founded. What can shake thy
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:50.920]   sure repose? With salvation's wall surrounded, thou may smile, but all thy foes." Are you
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:54:00.480]   on the foundation? If not, my dear friend, you'll be utterly bereft. As life darkens,
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:06.840]   as death comes, you'll be without hope and have nothing to look forward to except that
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:14.400]   darkness through which even a genius like Goethe couldn't see. The hopelessness, the
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:24.600]   eternity of despair. But that need not happen to you. The foundation is laid. You have but
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:44.480]   to come on to it and to be eternally safe, safe in life, safe in death, safe to all eternity.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.000]   Let us pray. Almighty God, we know not how to thank thee, but in a world of so much insecurity
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:55.520]   and pain and shame, that thy word still comes to us. We humbly thank thee, O God, that thou
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:02.800]   hast not lost patience with us, that the door of hope is still open, that the foundation
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:10.760]   is still there and available, and that thou dost ask nothing of us except a realization
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:21.080]   of our need and of our failure and our simple acceptance of thy word. God, have mercy upon
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:27.640]   all who are unhappy and troubled, all who are conscious of sin and of failure and of
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:37.920]   shame, all who have no hope with respect to the future. O God, open the eyes of the blind
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:47.120]   to the foundation that thou hast already provided in the person of thy dear Son, our blessed
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:56:00.280]   Lord and Saviour. Hear us, O Lord, for his name's sake. Amen.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:14.040]   We're going to sing together the hymn 257, 'Glorious things of thee has spoken, Zion,
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:33.080]   city of our God'. The hymn 257.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:44.200]   Glorious things of thee has spoken, Zion, city of our God.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:57:01.080]   The earth cannot be broken, only for his own abode. On the rock of ages counted, Mark and
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:19.160]   James the glory-born, where salvation was surrounded, of the exodus of thy son.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:35.320]   See the streams of living water, raining from eternal power. Well supply thy sons and daughters,
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:50.120]   and all fear of what they do. Who can make the water river, ever flowed in the earth to
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:58:05.480]   break? Praise his name, the Lord, the giver, ever a-fail from age to age.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:21.640]   Blessed having and of Zion, what victory he has won. With the truth let souls be one,
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:35.080]   praise him, we can preach to God. Give his love, his people, praises, for ourselves,
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:52.680]   to reign as king. Hark! the priesthood's song of praises, each for us a song of praise.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:59:03.720]   Major things of Zion's city, I to praise the heaven-born are.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:14.680]   Then the world divine all pleading, I will glory in thy name.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:25.880]   May he be in the world in pleasure, all his world with hope and soul.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:43.000]   Glory, joys and marvelous pleasure, God's one Zion in heaven's glory.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:50.280]   Gracious Lord, how we thank thee for intervening into history. We thank thee for thy love in
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:58.040]   sending the Lord Jesus Christ. We bless thee that he is the same yesterday, today and forever.
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:07.080]   We ask tonight, O Lord, that in thy love thou give us no peace, no rest, no respite from
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:13.560]   longing and searching until we find it in Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.840]   Therefore, O Lord, we pray that thou protect us from the enemy who would snatch away the
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:25.560]   good seed of thy word. May the cares of tomorrow, the burdens of life, the problems that we have
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:31.320]   to cope with, may they not, O Lord, submerge the very things that thou hast been saying to us
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:37.160]   tonight. O Lord, continue with us, we pray, by the gracious ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:43.240]   Grant that we may be built upon that solid foundation, even Jesus Christ our Lord.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:49.400]   Hear us, for we ask all of these things in and through his name alone. Amen.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:56.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
