[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.120]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.320]   Today on the show, we're going to talk about the week ahead or the few weeks ahead as I
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.320]   record this.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.320]   It's Saturday, March 14th, just before 8 o'clock in the evening, and it's been quite the momentous
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.680]   last few days.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.720]   But I wanted to share with you a few ideas.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.520]   Now recently I've been sharing with you what I've been thinking about, trying to help guide
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.080]   you, give you someone to hopefully thoughtful and rational to talk through some of the events
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.440]   that we're living through.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.320]   And it seems like you can't keep up.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.880]   News is changing very, very fast, which is why I'm recording this.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.080]   And basically what I'd like to accomplish in today's show is I'd like to give you some
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.760]   ideas so that you can understand basically what the different options are.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.560]   And as we think about the path ahead, as we think about where we're going from here, I
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.360]   want to share with you what I see as the best case scenario and the worst case scenarios.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.480]   And then you can watch over the coming days to try to figure out what we're more in line
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.480]   with.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.720]   And I want to talk about this in light of the specific threat of the virus itself, talk
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.080]   about kind of what a best case scenario looks like and what a worst case scenario looks
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.360]   like as I see it, and then also talk about it economically.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.920]   What is an economic best case scenario and what is an economic worst case scenario?
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.480]   And I did this analysis for myself because as I look around and watch the events of the
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.240]   day, it makes me, it's hard to believe.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.280]   I think we're probably all in that same situation where it's hard to believe.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.540]   And I figure if I'm finding this hard to believe, and the reason I say me is simply I'm someone
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.240]   who's thought about this for years.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.640]   I've read novels about viral outbreaks.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.840]   I've read history of previous viral outbreaks.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   I've thought about it.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.960]   I've considered what it would mean, and I find it hard to believe where we are.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.800]   My normalcy bias is quite strong.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.400]   I just think, man, my analysis says that these are the events that are happening, but I can't
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.480]   really believe it.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.560]   And that's that normalcy bias kicking up its head.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.440]   And so I figure if I'm finding it this hard to believe, then you're probably wrestling
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   with the same thing.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.000]   So I want to talk it through with you.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.600]   Let's begin with the virus.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.240]   Where do we go from here?
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.440]   Well, obviously we don't know, but let me paint out what I see as the bad situation,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.560]   the really bad situation, and also the not so bad situation.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.800]   And then you can consider where the facts are taking you when you look at this data.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.120]   Let's start with the not so bad situation.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.440]   That's actually where we are, again, on Saturday evening at a quarter to eight.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.160]   If we're going to say that the virus itself is not going to be so bad, here are some of
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.560]   the things that you would need to be convinced of.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.960]   Number one, you would need to be convinced that there aren't actually that many people
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.160]   sick in your country.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.640]   You would probably need to be convinced that the official statistics are accurate.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.240]   You can go and you can look up the official statistics.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.500]   There are many websites that are tracking it, saying something like almost 150,000 people
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.320]   around the world currently have this virus.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.280]   Those official statistics are tracking the number of people that have it, the number
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.160]   of people recovered, the number of people who have died.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.520]   And so perhaps you can look down at the official statistics in your country and you can say,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.240]   "Look, it's not quite so bad.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.400]   There aren't actually that many people sick.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.520]   Maybe there's only 5,000 people sick.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.760]   Maybe there's only 2,000 people sick."
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.400]   And perhaps that would be worth considering.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.800]   After all, the official statistics are official.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.320]   Now let me go through the list and then I'll come back and poke some of the holes in this
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.720]   because I don't think that this kind of best case scenario is realistic.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.880]   But that's what you would need to believe.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.320]   There aren't actually that many people that are sick in your country.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.920]   The second thing that you would need to believe for a not so bad scenario—notice I'm not
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.960]   saying great, just saying not so bad—is that the social isolation and various containment
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.920]   procedures that have been instituted in your country and in countries around the world,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.880]   that they're going to work, that they are effective in slowing the spread of the virus.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.040]   Not entirely, but they're effective enough to slow the spread of the virus so that the
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.800]   healthcare providers can actually keep up.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.720]   There's a good chance that happens.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.200]   It is true that social isolation will work.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   It's basically the only strategy that's really going to be effective.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.320]   That and washing your hands, which is why you hear it everywhere.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.720]   So if you're looking for the best case scenario, you want to believe that it's going to work.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.160]   Number three, you want to believe that because this is not such a serious sickness, for a
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.980]   best case viral situation, you're looking around and you're going to find that not very
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.320]   many people get seriously sick and die.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.520]   Basically you're looking for a low morbidity and a low mortality rate.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.400]   Yeah, we know that you get the virus, but it's a little bit of a cough, a little bit
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.040]   of a fever, a couple of days in bed and some chicken soup and people get better.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.160]   And so there's much debate and discussion about what's the actual mortality rate.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.480]   Is it 1%?
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.240]   Is it 0.04%?
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   Is it 20%?
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.680]   Well, of course there are various complicating factors to it, but if you want to see the
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.880]   best case scenario, that's what you're going to look for.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.100]   And I think there's evidence to think that it's not as bad as it could be.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.100]   Another thing that would really lead to a best case scenario with not that many people
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.700]   getting sick is just that we find some ways to really help treat people who are currently
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.580]   in serious condition.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.700]   There are some breakthrough therapeutic reliefs or methods of relief that are developed to
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.620]   help people who are really sick.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.540]   Maybe a company develops or maybe a physician or hospital proves that an antiviral drug
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.780]   is really helpful to people who are suffering from this condition.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.580]   Perhaps somebody finds a really breakthrough way to develop a new drug that provides relief
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.560]   for somebody who's experiencing the symptoms of the disease.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.620]   That would be really helpful.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.740]   Another thing you would want to see is that perhaps those who do get the virus develop
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.620]   immunity from it and they don't suffer any serious long-term effects.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.220]   Yeah, they got it, but they were young, they were healthy when they started and they were
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.540]   healthy afterwards.
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.580]   And then they also developed antibodies and they developed immunity to the virus.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.220]   That would be good because in many ways then you could say that the people who get it earlier,
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.220]   that's the best situation.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.720]   So that's one thing.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.120]   You would look for the virus to be pushed back with warm summer weather.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.700]   Many viruses are not tolerant of the heat and so perhaps the warm summer weathers that
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.260]   are coming to the northern hemisphere would help to have a relief from the virus and its
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.540]   effects.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.980]   Another thing you would look for is you would look for a successful vaccine.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:12.080]   You would look to see that a company or some companies or researchers are able to develop,
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.180]   are able to test, and then are able to manufacture and deliver a vaccine.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.260]   And that that vaccine would have wide acceptance, there would be wide vaccination rates, and
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.580]   that it was effective.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.940]   That it didn't have a lot of side effects, people were willing to take it, and they're
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.340]   able to develop and deliver billions of doses of the vaccine.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.940]   And then another thing that you would want to see for kind of a not so bad case scenario
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.940]   is simply that internationally the virus is only bad in the countries where it's already
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.940]   bad.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.940]   Yes, we know it's bad in Italy.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.100]   Yes, we know it's bad in Iran.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.120]   We know it was bad in China.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.060]   But people in other countries all around the world learn from the successes and failures
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.860]   of the countries that were hit first and they successfully follow the same procedures.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.420]   And that would help to mitigate its spread.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.960]   Now I see this scenario as the not so bad scenario.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:14.180]   This is about the best case that I can say because realistically, although the total
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:24.860]   number of people who are killed by it so far is less than some past sicknesses and viral
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.500]   infections, you have to acknowledge that it's pretty bad already.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.740]   There are many, many people dying.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.780]   Hundreds and hundreds of people dying all over the world.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.460]   Many hundreds and now thousands of people have died.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.300]   So it's pretty bad already.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.540]   So I don't think that we could call this a really good scenario, but I would call it
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.980]   just a not so bad scenario.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.140]   Certainly there are other factors, but if you're trying to think it through, those are
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.900]   some factors that I think are significant.
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.860]   Now let me give some quick analogs to those points.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.380]   First you'd have to believe that not very many people are currently sick in your country.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:06.340]   And in the last days I'm seeing many public officials openly and clearly acknowledge that
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.620]   the official statistics are simply not accurate.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:18.340]   And they're not accurate either because of problems with testing people or various factors.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.700]   Some estimates are that the true rates of infection are 10 times higher than what the
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.620]   official data is reported.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.720]   Some estimates are much, much higher than that.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.020]   In countries where there have been major problems with the testing, such as in the United States,
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.260]   where only a tiny number of people have actually been successfully tested, it's almost impossible
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.420]   for a rational person to believe that the numbers are accurate.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.260]   It just can't get there.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.620]   And so it's much more likely that there are many people sick.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.700]   If we switched from the not so bad condition to the really bad condition, what would make
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:59.060]   the viral infection really, really bad would be if there are hundreds of thousands of sick
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:04.500]   people already here, here being where you live, and that the virus has been spreading
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.100]   in the community for weeks and weeks and weeks, and that it wasn't accounted for due to poor
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.580]   testing or due to people not understanding the symptoms, et cetera.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.740]   That would be the really bad scenario.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.060]   Now is it really hundreds of thousands of people?
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.060]   I don't know.
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.940]   I'm not an epidemiologist.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.860]   This is not my area of expertise, but I don't believe the official statistics.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.940]   And so I would say realistically, we're probably somewhere between the official statistics
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.740]   and the worst case scenario.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.340]   But my instinct at this point is that there are at least thousands and thousands and thousands,
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.180]   if not tens of thousands of people who are sick and who've been spreading the sickness,
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.620]   and it just simply wasn't detected.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.100]   I hope I'm wrong.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:53.980]   The next thing that you would say, back to social isolation and containment procedures,
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.740]   to make something really bad, a really bad scenario, would mean that instead of social
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.900]   isolation and containment procedures being put in place quickly, that they're put in
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.500]   place very slowly.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.980]   They're enacted too late, and they're followed too little.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.580]   The social isolation and containment procedures are most effective if they're done before
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.520]   there's really strong evidence that they're needed.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.180]   If you wait until somebody's demonstrating symptoms, you wait until you have several
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:25.580]   sick students before you close schools, then you get better results.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.900]   Sorry, you get worse results if you wait for them to be sick.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.900]   If you find out about a sickness, find out that it might be closed, and then you close
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.320]   the school, it's much, much more effective.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.140]   And so a really bad scenario would just be that social isolation and containment procedures
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.260]   are enacted too late, and then they're just simply not followed.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.220]   They're not enforced, they're not followed.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.740]   People take it casually, they interact with one another.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.360]   Now here, my assessment is that it's probably a little of both.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.460]   Probably some of the hardcore social isolation and containment procedures are a little bit
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.100]   too late to be maximally effective.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.880]   I think people were caught sleeping and too slow because of the heavy cost of imposing
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.260]   those social isolation procedures, that people responded very slowly.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.580]   But I do think that people are taking the advice seriously.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:21.780]   If we look at some of the scenarios like in Italy currently, and Spain last couple days,
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:26.140]   and then France today, locking down France as of tonight, I think that people are taking
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.140]   it seriously.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.760]   And I think that people are taking the risk seriously in the United States and other places
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.820]   around the world.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:41.780]   So probably not at the really bad scenario, but probably not at the very best scenario.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.520]   Now the third factor, that not very many people get seriously sick and die.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.240]   If the virus were not going to have a severe impact, you would be looking for low morbidity
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.380]   and low mortality rates.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:58.060]   Whereas if you were looking for a really bad scenario, where it was really impactful, instead
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.060]   of it being low morbidity and low mortality, people would be very seriously critically
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.020]   ill and you'd have a very high death rate.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:12.260]   Now here, one of the things that's been encouraging to me over the past weeks has been that people
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.100]   who are generally healthy don't seem to suffer the most severe of complications from the
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.420]   virus.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.700]   Unfortunately, that means that those who are unhealthy do.
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.840]   And so we know of course that people who are older are at a high risk.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:33.080]   And here's one where I think the United States may face some very significant problems.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.140]   In the United States, there's a generally unhealthy population, significant levels of
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.360]   obesity, significant levels of diseases, lots of elderly people.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.100]   And in that population, it's possible that there would be a much higher rate of illness
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.100]   and a much higher rate of death.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.700]   So it's not the worst case scenario.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.340]   The disease is certainly not unsurvivable.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:14:01.900]   But when you consider the factors of who's involved, it's pretty significant.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.020]   And so the short answer is we don't know.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.980]   But the United States population is not the healthiest around.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.580]   Right now I'm focusing on the United States.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.660]   The bulk of my listening audience is in the United States.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.420]   But there are also other places in the world as well, which also have generally low health.
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.460]   We'll cover that in a moment.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.900]   The next thing that would make it really bad would be that instead of there being some
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:32.340]   breakthrough way to, you know, some great therapeutic relief, development of an antiviral
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.860]   drug that proves really helpful, what would happen is the opposite.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.120]   That not only is there not a breakthrough relief, but the healthcare system could be
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.680]   completely overwhelmed.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.020]   The healthcare system is flooded with cases, just far too many for the healthcare workers
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:54.100]   to handle, and then perhaps even worse, maybe due to the shortages of personal protective
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   equipment, of masks, of face shields, the healthcare workers themselves get sick.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.460]   Hospitals are overwhelmed.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.380]   And then the hospital workers have to—they can't treat everybody who needs help.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.740]   They have to engage in triage.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.500]   And there's a very high death rate because not only are there a lot of people who are
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.380]   sick, but the hospital systems are overwhelmed.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.900]   The healthcare workers are overwhelmed.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.100]   There's not enough ventilators.
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:21.180]   There's not enough relief supplies, and there are not enough doctors, not enough nurses,
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.180]   etc.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.740]   I think this is a very possible outcome.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.460]   I hope it doesn't happen, but it's a very possible outcome.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.700]   And I think if you look at Italy, you see that outcome right now.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:35.660]   You see the tents set up outside the hospitals, and you could see that same thing in the United
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.660]   States.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.460]   Instead of being able to treat people in hospitals, you're treating people in gymnasiums or out
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.420]   in tents, things like that.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.060]   And they're just simply triaging people.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.100]   They're saying, "You're too old.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.420]   We can't treat you because we don't have the facilities to actually treat you."
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.180]   And that would be very, very significant.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.900]   In addition, one thing that would go to the far end, the end of making it really bad,
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:04.100]   is simply instead of people who develop the virus getting immunity and not really suffering
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.880]   long-term effects, rather what would happen is that those who do recover continue to have
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.280]   lingering effects.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.940]   They have lung damage even after the illness, or perhaps they don't even develop immunity
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.580]   to the disease.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.820]   I'm not convinced on this subject one way or the other.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.220]   I've read concern on both sides, but I don't know how to judge what I read.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.300]   But it could be the case that those who have the disease experience, especially more significant
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.900]   cases, have continuing effects.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.100]   And I think that would change how people viewed it.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.340]   What I see happening is most people looking at this particular disease and saying, "Oh,
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.900]   the death rate is only this tiny percentage."
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:44.540]   But realistically, perhaps 20% of people, if 20% of people who get it have lingering
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.620]   effects, that would be really, really significant.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:55.820]   I don't want to spread fake news, so I'll just pause and just simply say I've seen stories
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.940]   on different things.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.220]   I don't know what the case would be.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.220]   What about the weather?
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.640]   Well, on a best-case scenario, the virus would abate with weather.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.260]   But in a worst-case scenario, perhaps it wouldn't abate significantly with weather.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.500]   Or perhaps even worse would be that it does abate with the weather.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.200]   People become complacent.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.500]   They return to their normal lives, and then it returns with a vengeance in the fall when
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.900]   the weather goes cold.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.500]   Now many people say, "Well, the virus is here.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.540]   It's going to be with us for a long time."
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.320]   And that may be the case.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.300]   That would be the kind of thing that's a worst-case scenario, where it maintains a very high infection
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.460]   rate and then it's with us for years in the future without the development of a vaccine
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.540]   or an effective treatment, et cetera.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.020]   And so that's the kind of thing that would make it really bad.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:45.740]   And then two more would be that instead of successfully developing, testing, manufacturing,
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.880]   and delivering a vaccine, researchers just can't create one.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.620]   There's no luck in developing a vaccine.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.100]   There's no luck in effectively finding one that would work.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.340]   And/or there are problems in the development and distribution of it.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.880]   I mean, ask yourself this question.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:10.340]   Given the current problems of developing an effective test for a disease, and then given
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:17.140]   the current problems of manufacturing and distributing an effective test for a disease,
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:23.260]   do you have a high degree of confidence in the authorities in your country to be able
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:33.100]   to actually successfully develop, manufacture, distribute, and deliver a safe and effective
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.180]   vaccine?
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.820]   Especially given the widespread concerns with vaccination in general?
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:47.500]   As far as I'm concerned, that's a hard one to really believe.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:54.600]   And then perhaps the worst case scenario, or the last factor that would make it a worst
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.100]   case scenario, would be that instead of the best case that we talked about, that internationally
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.220]   the virus is just where it's already at and then people close their borders, every country
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.220]   in the world closes their borders and they're able to stop it right there.
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.740]   Instead of that, you have a real international pandemic.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.660]   You have real international contagion.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:17.940]   And perhaps countries with strong, well-funded healthcare systems hold out for a little while
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:24.100]   longer before they get overwhelmed and they collapse, a la Italy right now.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.740]   But the virus spreads globally and you have countries with weaker healthcare systems and
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:36.060]   poorer populations and people in poorer health that are just decimated by the virus and it
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:41.800]   leaves hundreds and hundreds of thousands of citizens, if not millions.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.060]   That would be a worst case scenario.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.580]   The question would be, I'm sure there are other factors that you can think of, but the
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:53.260]   question would be if you're trying to analyze it practically, look around you and see which
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:59.740]   of those seems, which of those factors do you see happening right now?
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:06.220]   My answer is, for me, what I see right now is I'm hoping for the not so bad case, but
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.780]   I think it's probably somewhere in the middle of that.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:16.100]   The point being, it's a serious, serious problem.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.500]   And the reason we have such a hard time with it is just simply the difficulty of understanding
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.820]   the numbers, difficulty of understanding the multiplying effects and exponential growth
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:29.980]   and the difficulty of really digging in and grasping the significance of the numbers.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.820]   We're still at that place where it's only some thousands of people.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.900]   I still hear people saying, "Well, so many thousands of people were killed by H1N1,"
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.460]   or "So many thousands of people received it," and "So many thousands of people get the flu,"
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.540]   etc.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.760]   Nobody disputes that fact.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:54.540]   The fact that disputes that argument, however, is just simply the fact of viral replication.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.940]   Time will tell.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:01.620]   I think my guess is we're probably somewhere in the middle of those two things.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:09.980]   And my point in going through that type of analysis is to say, I believe that an analysis
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:22.260]   that leaves you saying, "This is bad, and this is going to be bad," is rational.
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.300]   Because that not so bad scenario, still pretty bad.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.940]   Now, hopefully there's something I'm missing there.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.420]   I really hope, but it's still pretty bad is the point.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.380]   Time will tell.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.460]   Now let's switch to the economic effects.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.860]   I'm encouraged that I'm not—I don't think we're going to be in that worst-case scenario.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.140]   I think there'll be some breakthroughs.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.660]   I have a huge degree of confidence in human ingenuity.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.860]   There are thousands of people all around the world who are working day and night to try
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.140]   to find solutions to some of these problems.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:01.420]   And although the problems are real and they're dire, human beings shine in times like this.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.460]   And so I don't think it's going to be a worst-case scenario, but I do think it's going to be
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.460]   quite bad.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.180]   Hopefully I'm wrong.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.780]   Now let's switch to the economy, because after all, this is a finance show.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:20.420]   And now let's talk about the best-case economic scenario and the worst-case economic scenario.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:27.780]   First, remember where we are as I record this, again, Saturday, March 14 at now, 8.06 p.m.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.140]   Eastern Time.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:37.060]   The best-case economic scenario is already quite difficult.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:48.300]   As I record this, Italy, Spain, and France are all in basically a societal lockdown.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:56.500]   They still have some services like supermarkets and pharmacies open, some other necessary
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.500]   workers, et cetera.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.060]   But basically, the whole countries, all of those countries in Europe are basically locked
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.380]   down.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:10.460]   Dozens of countries around the globe have closed their borders to travelers, some completely,
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:15.100]   letting in no tourists, no travelers, some just to tourists and travelers from certain
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.380]   regions.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.540]   That's where we already are.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.700]   Now the best-case scenario would be that it just stops with this.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.300]   These countries that have locked down, they finish their lockdown in two weeks, as they
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:37.100]   talk about, two or three weeks, and then life goes back to normal, perhaps.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.500]   That would help with the economy if it were a short-term thing.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.340]   Perhaps all of the countries that are not, Italy, Spain, and France at the moment, perhaps
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.460]   for some reason they can escape having to do the same thing.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:53.620]   Maybe the United States doesn't actually have to go to a nationwide lockdown or martial
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.620]   law.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:24:00.180]   Perhaps it's just magically it doesn't need to be done.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:04.460]   Maybe magically there's actually only 2,000 cases in the United States or 5,000 cases
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.780]   or whatever the official number is right now.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.740]   I forget at the moment.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.940]   Because of that, they're all perfectly quarantined and all those people are locked away and the
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.940]   United States doesn't actually have to go to lockdown.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.500]   You just have what's already in place.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.220]   We continue what has already been done for a few weeks.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.900]   School is canceled, but it's only canceled for a couple of weeks.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.460]   Large gatherings of people are banned in the vast majority of states, but only for a few
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.740]   more weeks.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.900]   The timing is relatively short, maybe one more month of this.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.700]   The schools follow through on their current few weeks of breaks.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.780]   They do some extra cleaning, maybe move the desks farther apart, and then everybody goes
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.660]   back to school, back to work, and life resumes.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.860]   All of the events that have been canceled start slowly picking up again.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.140]   Baseball, for example.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:51.540]   Maybe spring training was mixed, but baseball season starts on time.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.760]   Then conventions are rescheduled, but are later and smaller.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.340]   All the people that had to figure out how do I do this with my event and they canceled
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.980]   it, but later on they go ahead and reschedule.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.400]   Maybe this magically happens all throughout the world at the same time.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.740]   Right now it's just three more weeks and then we're out of it.
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.420]   I'm sorry if I sound sarcastic.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.340]   It's just I'm trying to paint the best example and you can hardly believe it.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.340]   I don't know.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.840]   Maybe you say this is an economic good.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.340]   We're looking for the best case scenario.
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.780]   We got rid of all the old people.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.780]   They're all dead.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.940]   We got rid of all the sick people.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.940]   They're all dead.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.940]   We freed up some of the strain on Social Security and Medicare.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.700]   And now, hey, after all, in the United States, the baby boomers, they're all the old ones.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.700]   They have all the wealth.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.480]   And so they die.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.600]   All their children inherit the wealth and the younger generation gets all the money
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   and they can go out and start spending and consuming the money.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.920]   After all, the old people were just sitting on it.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.920]   They didn't need it anyway.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   So get rid of them.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.400]   We released the strain on the social net and then everyone can spend money.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:57.920]   Obviously, that's an incredibly offensive and horrific thing to say, but it's like,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.400]   I don't know, maybe that helps the economy.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.780]   Maybe all the people in industries that have already been devastated by this just get bailed
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:13.340]   out by magical government printing presses, magical loans, free money, free money for
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.340]   all.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.340]   No student loan interest.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.340]   Forgive the student loans.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.340]   Give it all away.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:23.780]   Free money and it all just works.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.820]   Even that best case scenario is pretty stinking bad.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.840]   And that's where we already are.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:39.440]   If you count the cost on the amount of money that is being lost every single day by so
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.160]   many people.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.800]   Now right now it's industries that are very close to things like travel.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:51.860]   But the news headlines of yesterday, Delta Airlines cutting 40% of their capacity.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.880]   That's 40% of flights and I bet the remaining flights are not even full.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:02.840]   Just imagine everybody associated with travel and think about all of the industries that
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.460]   rely on that.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.520]   When you go through these industries, you go through the NBA, you go through these big
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.520]   headlined ones, but it's not just them.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:20.060]   It's people who have conferences and classes and who make their living in small hotel rooms
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.120]   and small meeting rooms and things like that.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.600]   All of that stuff, devastated.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:35.080]   And even if the event itself is just short term, the trouble of planning it, they can't
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.680]   plan.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.080]   When some of these events are held, think about the Olympics.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:47.020]   The Olympics is years of very, very carefully scheduled and planned out events that have
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.360]   to happen exactly on schedule.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.680]   Otherwise they just don't work.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:59.440]   And so imagine if the Olympics wind up canceled and that just affects the big guy, the little
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.880]   guy.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:09.920]   The point is simply that what already is, is bad, is devastating.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.600]   Even down to your next door neighbor.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.880]   There are lots and lots of people who have rental houses that they put on Airbnb.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:24.640]   Well Airbnb just came out two days ago and changed their booking policies and provided
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.240]   free cancellation to everybody.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.000]   I saw lots of people rejoicing over that about go Airbnb, taking care of the customer.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.540]   The problem is what about the person with the house to rent?
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:41.120]   They depended on a clearly written policy from Airbnb and now their schedule is just
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.120]   being completely down.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.440]   They have no cancellation fees.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.520]   They've got mortgages to pay.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.360]   They've got rent payments to pay.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.080]   They've got expenses.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.240]   And that's just, these are just examples that I think about.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.860]   You can't even imagine the number of examples that are out there.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:01.440]   So if the best case scenario is economically that we just deal with what's already been
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.760]   done and then magically in a couple of weeks everyone goes back to work, everybody picks
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   up and we're back at it, it's already devastating.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.720]   So what's a worst case economic scenario?
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.840]   Well let's paint that one out.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.040]   Worst case scenario is all the countries that are currently locked down stay locked down
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   for longer.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:31.160]   Because here's the thing, you've got to, for the lockdown thing to work, which is really
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:37.640]   one of the very few public health tools that a public health official has, for that to
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:47.420]   actually work you have to do it until the virus runs its course.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:52.520]   If you do it, if you release too early then it winds up being no good.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.560]   And so maybe, everyone gives these todays, right?
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:01.240]   It's like if your child's school was canceled, the school sent home a letter saying your
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.160]   child's school is canceled until March 29.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.560]   That's what the letter says.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.640]   But you know that the school has no idea how long school is actually going to be canceled.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.200]   They're just trying to give an initial date.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.520]   Because there's so many factors that are involved with them having a date to start again that
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.360]   that's just their first goal.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.960]   Realistically it could be school's canceled for a month.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.520]   Realistically it could be school's canceled for six months.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   They have no idea.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.260]   None of us do.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.360]   So all the countries that are currently locked down stay locked down for longer.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.280]   And then worst case scenario is that more and more and more countries are locked down
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.480]   tightly.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:45.720]   Now personally I think that is the probable outcome.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.680]   I think it's probable that many of the countries that are locked down stay locked down for
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.000]   longer and that many more countries are following suit.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.480]   The reason I think that's probable is just simply due to the time delayed nature of dealing
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.320]   with the viral outbreak.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:07.840]   The countries, if you put yourself in the head of a public health official in any country
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.920]   and you think through what they're facing, they're facing the same data that you and
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.680]   I can see.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.200]   They're facing a viral infection that is spreading through the population.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.080]   It's multiplying every few days, doubling every few days.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.240]   They're dealing with a healthcare system that can't cure it, can only provide therapeutic
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:38.200]   care and try to keep people alive until their bodies can get rid of it.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   And basically the only tool that they actually have is some version of isolation.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   That's it.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.040]   That's about the only tool they have.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:53.360]   They can try to put out tests and whatnot, but all of that is designed around the strategy
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.120]   of isolation.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.080]   The goal is not to isolate an entire economy and shut everything down.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.500]   The goal is just to isolate a family.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.960]   That's why the testing is important in the early phases of an outbreak, so that you can
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.640]   test and then you can test the person that that person talked to and you can isolate
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.860]   those people.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.600]   But it's still an isolation strategy.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.960]   Once it breaks out, once it gets to that system of community spread, then now isolation and
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:25.560]   quarantine becomes just a giant hammer that has to be used.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.480]   And so you start, because it's such a devastating thing to do, you start in modest amounts.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.160]   You try to isolate and say to people, "Well, let's cancel schools.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.120]   That's some measure of isolation."
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.340]   And then you say, "Well, there's an outbreak in this city over here, so let's isolate this
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.920]   city and let's lock this city down."
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.840]   Again, look at Italy.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.900]   Let's lock these regions down.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.760]   And then you see that that's not working and then you lock the whole country down and it
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.800]   just gets tighter and tighter and tighter until you can get it to work.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:56.480]   But because it's such a heavy, awful thing to do, because it devastates lives and livelihoods,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.100]   that's why a public health official will move slowly.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:06.000]   So if you want to look at where you're likely to be in the United States, look at where
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.120]   Italy was a few weeks ago, because you can't speed it up or slow it down.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.800]   It's just a systematic progression.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:20.760]   Unless there's something that comes in and stops the spread, it's highly predictable.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.200]   It just feels like it's all happening very slowly, because it is, but it's as predictable
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:31.680]   and as inexorable as almost anything else.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.840]   I think that you're going to see a lot more lockdowns and I think that they're not going
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.600]   to be nearly as effective as they seem to have been in China.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:48.280]   Now it'll be interesting to see what happens in Italy, France and Spain in the coming week,
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:56.960]   but China says that they have effectively stopped the spread of the disease.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.360]   My guess is they probably have.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.360]   I have a hard time trusting anything they say, but my guess is they probably have.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.120]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.200]   But even that said, I think the only country in the world capable of doing what China did
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.280]   is China.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:18.400]   One of the major benefits of a viciously strong authoritarian government is they can move
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.360]   fast in situations like this.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.840]   Just think about their response of building those hospitals.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.240]   China comes in and says, "We're building a thousand bed hospital on that field," and
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.560]   nobody starts protesting environmentalism and nobody starts protesting about, "Well,
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:46.080]   you don't have a diverse workforce and you can't do that and you can't make those people
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.160]   work overtime and blah, blah, blah."
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.220]   China just says, "We're doing it," and they do it.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:56.160]   That's one of the benefits of an authoritarian dictatorship.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.840]   They can do incredible things and that's what China has been doing for decades now.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.600]   They've been taking money and just building these mega cities just again and again and
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.600]   again and again.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.480]   Now in the process they destroy people, but that's not the society that we live in in
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.000]   the West.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.200]   We are almost the polar opposite of that.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.960]   This is how ridiculous it is.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:28.760]   I was in bed the other day listening to the radio and I was in the United States and I
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:35.120]   had LASIK eye surgery done and while I had to recover from that surgery, after the surgery
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.080]   I had to go home and I had to lie in bed with my eyes closed for six hours as part of the
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.040]   surgery, but I had to put drops in my eyes every hour and a half so I didn't sleep.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.160]   I put on NPR and I'm listening to NPR and this is in the midst of it.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.600]   When I was younger I used to listen to NPR all the time.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   Loved NPR.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:57.080]   I don't know, maybe I just wanted to have that cool NPR voice and modulated sound and
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:04.260]   those elegant tones and perfect diction of the perfect East Coast and West Coast neutral
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.360]   accent and talk with all my hoity-toity friends.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.320]   But I'm listening to NPR and they're talking about school closures.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.480]   I could not believe some of the stuff that they were saying on NPR.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.000]   It's been years since I've listened to NPR.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.080]   I could not believe it.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.880]   What they were talking about was how all these schools are canceling school, but they're
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:31.640]   trying to decide whether they can teach school online, teach classes online, or whether they
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.320]   should just cancel class.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.640]   And they're talking about how the school superintendents and educators, administrators are wrestling
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:47.720]   with this because they have to treat everybody perfectly fairly.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:54.560]   And after all, only the privileged students have computers and internet connections.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.040]   And unless the school can provide the same access to education for all the students,
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:06.700]   then the school can't teach and they can't do the classes.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.480]   And so probably what they're going to do is probably just completely cancel class because
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:17.280]   they can't guarantee that all the students have access to computers and internet connections.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.960]   So they're probably going to cancel class and make up the work in some kind of summer
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   term.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.120]   I thought, "Is this what the United States is these days?
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:37.960]   That any 10-year-old kid can go online and become a teacher themselves with nothing but
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.760]   a cell phone?
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:46.600]   And you have an entire world who lives on a cell phone, but you're saying that we can't
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:52.560]   teach school online because only the privileged kids have computers and internet?"
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.480]   I'll acknowledge as much as anybody that there may be somebody who doesn't have a phone.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   Maybe, hopefully.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.720]   Probably the kid's parents are smart.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.160]   Maybe they don't have a computer.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.660]   But that's got to be the tiniest percentage of problems.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:15.140]   And to have the entire student body dragged down and not be allowed to learn or study
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.380]   based on this is insane.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.120]   That's the world in the United States that we live in.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.880]   So now you take that culture and the going on and on about how do the stools deliver
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:30.220]   free lunch and certainly, and I'm listening to all these stories about food insecurity
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.220]   and housing insecurity.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.400]   And I think I'm like, one thing I learned is I'll never listen to NPR.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.520]   You're guaranteed to be depressed at the end of that when you listen to NPR.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.640]   I felt so disempowered and overwhelmed and like I just couldn't do anything in the world
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.480]   unless somebody came and solved my problems for me.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:52.520]   But you take that kind of culture and you try to say, "We're going to lock everybody
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:39:01.020]   down and we're going to stay locked down and then we're going to bring this technological
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.920]   system in that China has done where now you got to show the pass on the internet in order
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.120]   for you to get on the train."
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   It's insane.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:14.720]   The United States is doomed in that situation.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:21.400]   That's not even acknowledging just the complete general lack of compliance culturally.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.160]   The Chinese, they do it, right?
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.400]   They put up with it.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:31.280]   And some of them speak out, but Americans start a war before they do that.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.200]   Americans certainly aren't compliant with that kind of thing.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.400]   So the point is the lockdown, it's not going to be a short-term thing.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.280]   They can't turn around and pivot the way that China has.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.280]   It's not going to happen.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.240]   You can't even get testing kits created and delivered and administered.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.680]   How on earth would you do anything even more difficult than testing?
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.660]   And the testing doesn't even fix anything.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:58.360]   So worst case in economic scenario is that the countries that are currently locked down
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.320]   stay locked down and locked down for a long time.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.720]   That would be very bad.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   What about supply chains?
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   Well, what you're seeing right now is you're seeing supply chain weakness.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   That's why there's shortages.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.080]   We've talked about this extensively on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.120]   There's always some slack in the system, but the whole system is designed for efficiency,
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.760]   for maximum profit.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:25.320]   And maximum profit means that any store, any retailer, any distributor, any manufacturer
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.200]   at every stage, you don't want to maintain large amounts of inventory because that's
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   inefficient.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:40.800]   So you want to maintain enough inventory to maintain operations during normal conditions,
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.160]   plus you want to maintain enough inventory to be able to resupply and to cover some shocks
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.880]   to the system.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:53.840]   Because especially if you think about large retailers, large retailers want to be a basic
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.980]   source of supply for their customers.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:03.480]   So if you're running public supermarkets and public supermarkets is getting ready for Thanksgiving
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.160]   season, public supermarkets does not ever want to run out of turkey.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:11.600]   And so they're going to do everything possible to maintain turkey, including having an excess
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.580]   supply, which is why they put it on sale afterwards.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:20.460]   It's far more important during Thanksgiving that publics not run out of turkey, or whatever
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.340]   your local grocery chain of choice is, it's far more important that they don't run out
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:29.100]   of turkey than that they have perfect efficiency during Thanksgiving, which is why you see
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.920]   big buckets of turkey and then sale afterwards.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:37.220]   But and the same thing applies during other difficult times of crisis.
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.580]   So if it's hurricane season, Costco does not want to sell out of water during hurricane
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.140]   season and so they plan for that.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.380]   Walmart does not want to sell out of chips and beer during Super Bowl season.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:53.740]   So they plan for it with these very sophisticated supply chains and you have warehouses that
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.100]   do have stocks of that because they don't want to run out.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:04.460]   But the problem is that only works for predictable events like hurricanes or Thanksgiving or
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.060]   Super Bowl.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.420]   It doesn't work for the black swan events.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.460]   It doesn't work for things like a global flu pandemic.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.580]   And it doesn't work for a global flu pandemic if the manufacturers are not able to create
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.100]   and deliver.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.300]   And so what happens when supply starts taking off?
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:30.380]   First, it's a little weird and the suppliers, the stores don't know how to deal with it
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.580]   when something weird takes off like toilet paper.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:39.820]   The great toilet paper shortage of 2020 is not necessarily a practical thing.
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.500]   It's a product of human psychology in my opinion.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.760]   Nobody just magically needs cases and cases of toilet paper.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.260]   But that was the thing that people started to realize, "Hey, if I get locked down in
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.340]   my house, I'd like to be able to use toilet paper.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.220]   After all, I use this stuff pretty frequently.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.220]   I'd like to have it."
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.380]   So they started buying more and it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy and it creates
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.540]   a human panic that's all based upon human psychology.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.220]   Somebody says, "Well, you should buy some toilet paper."
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.420]   And another person says, "Hey, that's a good idea."
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.660]   So they go and buy some toilet paper.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.540]   Then somebody posts online and says, "Look, people are buying toilet paper, big carts
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.820]   full of toilet paper."
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.700]   And then you get worried about it and you say, "I got to go get toilet paper."
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.860]   And you're worried because now instead of just getting one or two packages because you
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.700]   thought it was a little bit, you thought, "You know, there's going to be a toilet paper
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.700]   shortage."
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.580]   And so you load up your cart and then that creates the toilet paper shortage.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:33.580]   And so the toilet paper shortage is not due to a practical need for months and months
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.940]   of toilet paper.
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.660]   It's based upon the human psychology of seeing that there is a need.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:43.100]   Now the current food shortages of some kinds of foodstuffs in some places are a much more
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.140]   obvious example of a more practical need.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.420]   But even still, the human psychology comes into place.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:54.060]   And that's where the just-in-time delivery system fails because you can't predict human
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.420]   psychology.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:00.620]   It could have been toilet paper, but it could have also been something that was related
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:05.180]   to, I don't know, Tylenol or chicken or something.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.140]   It just happened to be toilet paper.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:12.940]   So it's got to be obviously some useful good like toilet paper, but you can't predict that.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:17.700]   And then once there's a need, then people start to freak out and they start to buy more
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:21.780]   and then you start to have hoarding and then people stop trusting the system.
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:30.060]   And so the supply chain continues to be stretched and stretched and stretched, little by little,
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.540]   pulled tighter and tighter and tighter.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:39.420]   And the retailers rush all the goods out from their central warehouses.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.020]   They rush all those goods to the stores as fast as they can.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:48.820]   And if the whole supply chain is working on the back end where stuff is coming into those
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:53.500]   warehouses, then they've got a chance of making it.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.500]   What's the problem?
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:58.780]   The problem is the virus hit China first.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:04.580]   The problem is that China was shut down for weeks.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:11.780]   The problem is that it's still not up to normal capacity.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.860]   The problem is that many things are manufactured in many other places and countries are starting
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.320]   to protect themselves.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.940]   One of the most concerning ones was the Indian ban on the export of medicines.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:28.900]   A huge percentage of medicines are manufactured in India and that is very concerning because
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:34.300]   the medical supply chain has exactly the same need or the same system as toilet paper.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.220]   Now there's some slack in it, but then when the shortages come, it's more and more and
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.960]   more and more.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:45.140]   So the worst case scenario is that the supply chains continue to be stripped out and that
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.940]   resupply doesn't happen for months and months.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.700]   Now we could make this worse.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.580]   Now so far, thankfully, the trucks are still going.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.060]   The truckers are still delivering goods and everything is still working.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.660]   But what if there's some kind of problem with the trucking system and the truckers stop
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.980]   delivering goods?
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:09.700]   That would shut down resupply and that's one of the major weak links in the supply chain.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.420]   Now thankfully at the moment, I don't see any current risk that would say that the truckers
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.540]   would have to stop delivering goods.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:24.020]   A trucker in his cab is just as safe from the coronavirus as he is at home and so he
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.940]   can still keep working and be happy for the money, probably.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.700]   But if something happened that interrupted trucking, it'd be desperately terrible.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:37.100]   Or more importantly, it would be more countries stopping exporting products.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.860]   We've mentioned the Indian medicines.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.140]   For a nation that lives largely on imports like the United States, it's really tough.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.420]   And so you'd have shortages everywhere.
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:49.060]   And now part of the bad economic scenario is that people are hurting.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.060]   They're uncomfortable.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.500]   They can't get the stuff that they're used to.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:47:01.740]   Now the United States, we're used to a ridiculous amount of variety, but it can be serious.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.060]   There are people right now who are having to come up with alternatives to toilet paper
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:12.140]   and that's frustrating, annoying, and uncomfortable, and hopefully sobering enough to make them
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:16.300]   recognize how foolish they have been and perhaps how foolish you have been by not planning
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.180]   ahead for that.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.740]   Now what else would make the economic situation really bad?
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:26.780]   Well, large numbers of layoffs.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:32.020]   Do you think that there will be large numbers of layoffs?
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:36.340]   The answer right now is probably I don't know.
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:41.180]   Over the last months, been significant good jobs reports, right?
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.300]   Hasn't been a lot of layoffs.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:50.060]   And I think right now we're in a situation where everybody is kind of holding their breath.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.460]   Now there are starting to be people laid off, but there are people who are at the very front
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.540]   end of the supply chain.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:01.060]   There are people who are at the very front end, maybe some dock workers.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.540]   I've read anecdotes of gyms laying off personal training staff.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:08.300]   People aren't going to want to go to the gym, be exposed to people, and so they're laying
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.300]   off personal trainers.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.500]   That's expected, but so far I don't think there's been a lot of layoffs.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:18.780]   The reason is the most difficult thing that a company faces or an employer faces is how
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:24.180]   to figure out how to bring on good staff and get them trained.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:31.580]   And so an employer does not want to lay off staff unnecessarily because it's hard to replace
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.840]   them.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:41.780]   And so you have Apple, Apple computer, or I guess I should say Apple electronic product.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.220]   Make a lot more than computers these days.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:50.060]   So you have Apple that comes out and says, "We're closing all stores all around the world
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.580]   except in greater China."
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:55.980]   That's a pretty serious thing.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.860]   But Apple is saying, "We're going to keep paying everybody their wages."
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.940]   Well Apple has been hugely profitable.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.640]   Apple has a nice war chest of cash.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.780]   They can do that for a little while.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.980]   The neighborhood grocer wants to do the same thing.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:15.980]   The neighborhood hardware store guy or whatever, the local businesses, our neighborhood restaurateur
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:17.780]   wants to do the same thing.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.160]   He wants to keep his staff.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.020]   He knows it's good for business to treat employees right.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:28.140]   But we all have a limit to how much money we actually have.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:38.640]   We all have a certain amount that we can dedicate to paying our staff.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:44.140]   And everybody, all of us are sitting here with bated breath waiting to try to figure
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.020]   out what's going to happen.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:51.180]   I'm sitting here late on Saturday evening trying to figure out what's going to happen.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:54.860]   Every business owner is sitting there trying to figure out what's going to happen.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.740]   We're all sitting down looking at our bank accounts saying, "Okay, what's my triggering
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.900]   point?
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.060]   When am I going to make a decision?"
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:06.400]   Which is why the next week is going to be crucial.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.900]   And then probably the week after that.
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:12.380]   And then within two weeks probably the trajectory that we're on is going to be clearer.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.840]   But still we're going to be waiting and waiting, watching, waiting, watching, waiting.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.840]   What happens?
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.340]   What happens?
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.700]   But back to that viral outbreak, best case scenario, worst case scenario.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.960]   If magically it's all cleared up in the next two weeks and we can get back to business
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.940]   as usual, maybe it's not so bad.
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:34.960]   But do you see any reasonable, rational analysis that would say that we're just going to magically
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:40.740]   get back to work and everybody be ready to go two weeks from now?
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.940]   I can't see it.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:47.780]   And so economically I think most business owners are watching.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.460]   They're probably giving it a week and they're probably getting things ready and they're
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.260]   calculating the cost of severance.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.940]   If they approve severance, they're trying to figure out who it is.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.900]   This has all come on so fast.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.900]   They're trying to figure out who the best employees, who are they going to keep, who
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:07.180]   are they not going to keep, what tiers of employees are they going to lay off, et cetera.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:16.020]   Because there are entire industries that are being brought down to nothing right now.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:23.260]   This is very, very significant, but everyone's waiting with bated breath.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:27.980]   So worst case scenario, companies lay off huge numbers of workers and outside of healthcare
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:32.140]   and maybe grocers or something like that, medical systems, entire industries are just
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.380]   brought to a halt.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.980]   Working from home is great for those who can, but there are so many, many people who can't
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.620]   work from home.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.380]   And then what else?
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:50.740]   The economic effects, the job layoffs lead directly to people reducing spending.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:54.780]   Reducing spending leads to recession and it just has an ongoing spiraling effect where
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.260]   it goes down and down and down and down.
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:05.060]   Now the Federal Reserve is doing its very best to stave that off.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.060]   Maybe they do it, maybe they don't.
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.060]   I don't know.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:14.100]   Worst case scenario, the Federal Reserve is exposed to have done everything they can and
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.820]   they can't improve things.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:25.260]   The era of free money and debt and it's all going to do is perhaps exposed to be the lie
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:29.420]   that it is.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.420]   That would be a worst case scenario.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:35.740]   And the worst case scenario there would just be it goes on for a long time.
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:39.420]   At some point in time there's going to be a major reckoning on government debt.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.420]   I don't think we're there yet, but maybe I'm wrong.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.260]   Maybe we're there.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.460]   Some point there's going to be a reckoning.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:50.620]   So that's what I see it.
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:55.340]   That's my kind of best case, worst case, best case, worst case.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:01.260]   And my hope is of course that I'm too pessimistic and the best case is maybe it's better than
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:02.260]   the best case.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.980]   I don't see how.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.860]   If you see how, tell me.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:11.820]   But I've talked myself through this for days and I don't see any arguments to say that
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:18.140]   my best case scenarios are really even possible.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:22.380]   They just don't, I don't see how.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:28.660]   Now the worst case scenarios I don't think are going to be here.
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.140]   I think it's probably going to be somewhere between them.
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:40.020]   But when the best case scenarios are bad enough, you don't need the worst case.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.020]   So how do you know what's really going to happen?
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.020]   The only thing I say is just simply watch.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:50.260]   You're going to have to trust yourself and trust your own analysis.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:57.620]   You can't, you need to listen to experts obviously and I've tried to talk about where I'm an
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.260]   expert and where I'm not.
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:03.780]   We need to listen to experts and we need to listen to the experts' arguments and assess
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:08.980]   them to see are they compelling.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.940]   We need to listen to the official data.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.340]   That's important.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:17.300]   There are genuine public servants.
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.300]   There are public health officials.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.520]   They do know what they're doing.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.740]   But it's hard for me to trust the info from the government.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:30.620]   Just simply because the number one vested interest that a government official has is
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.780]   in avoiding panic.
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:38.820]   And generally it's very rare to find a government official who's willing to tell the truth because
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.820]   they're willing to trust people.
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.300]   I desperately wish they would.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:45.220]   I desperately wish they would just stand up and say, "This is probably going to be bad
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.500]   but we're going to get through it together."
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.420]   But instead they lie and it's sad.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:54.100]   So listen carefully, listen with a jaundiced eye because they don't really have another
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.060]   choice.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:06.100]   But my method is just simply to say, "Let me do the analysis and then what can I do
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:11.860]   to prepare?"
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:12.860]   You have to do the same thing.
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.620]   We're all in different circumstances.
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.660]   We all have different businesses.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.620]   We all have different things that we're capable of doing.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:29.740]   But prepare for the worst case, hope for the best, and then lay out tiered plans.
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.420]   Hopefully Monday I'll talk some more about, we'll talk about stocks, we'll talk about
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.880]   the economy.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.300]   Maybe Monday, maybe Tuesday I'll try to come with you.
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:42.980]   I'll work steadily this next week to bring you ideas and solutions and information to
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.740]   try to help you through.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.620]   I hope to be able to host some Q&A calls.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:50.700]   I'll do my best to help you and walk with you through this.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.500]   But here's what I want to encourage you.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.880]   In a bad situation there are always opportunities and there are always things that you can do
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.620]   to make a bad situation better.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:04.960]   And the thing that is fantastic, at least about the American culture, is that Americans
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:11.820]   have often shown, and I think still can show, and you can do this from anywhere in the world,
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:15.680]   an indomitable spirit in the face of adversity.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.160]   And I think that that is what is needed.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:23.360]   This next week I'm going to do a show, it's on my outline, I hope to be able to do a show.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.720]   I may be cautious with my words.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.640]   We don't know what this next week is going to hold.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.360]   I'll do a show on simply not participating in the recession.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.920]   And then I'll do a show on changing your goals.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.360]   Because when life changes you can change.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:43.360]   And just because things are bad doesn't mean they have to be bad, bad, bad for you.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.480]   We'll give you ideas, try to walk with you through it.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:52.120]   We'll work with you to try to do things well.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.360]   Don't panic, but do take stock.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:59.200]   Don't do anything stupid, be careful.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:03.880]   But I hope that by going through this if you see some error in my logic, then of course
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.000]   you'll know that.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.600]   But if you don't see an error in my logic, then hopefully this will help you to have
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.720]   some idea of what's to come in the weeks ahead.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:17.480]   The very least you need to be prepared to stay at home and be quarantined, or isolate,
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.680]   self-isolation or whatever it is for some weeks.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.040]   And then what I'd say is make a plan on how to make that useful for yourself.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:28.840]   I was talking last night, I did a live stream in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:33.560]   and I was talking about some information that I received from a friend of mine who lives
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.720]   in Italy.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.480]   And she was talking about what she wished she had known before being locked down.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:41.600]   And some of her comments were, "I wish that we had, there's so much time we could have
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.120]   done on house projects.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:48.640]   So I wish that I had gone and I wish that I'd gotten paint and we could have painted
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.040]   our house and we could have, I wish I'd had flowers and we could have redone our landscaping
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.680]   and put the time to good use."
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.360]   And I thought, "That's a great idea."
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.440]   So if there's any house projects that have been on your list and you need lumber, you
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:08.360]   need paint, or you need flowers, or you need seeds, or you need shovels, then go out and
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:11.880]   get that stuff and just be prepared to work from your house.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.520]   The other thing that I was thinking, I was wandering around Twitter and there was a Twitter
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.040]   trend on Twitter this afternoon about how Shakespeare wrote evidently King Lear when
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.320]   he was stuck home, working from home during a plague.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:30.340]   Newton invented physics or calculus when he was off of university during a plague.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:35.120]   And that's really my point, is that if you're going to be stuck at home and not able to
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.880]   leave, might as well make it productive, might as well make it useful.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:43.240]   I'm intending to ignore the recession and I'm intending to work hard to serve you.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.960]   And I'm intending my goal is to have the best year ever.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.000]   Because at the end of the day, if you can serve people effectively in their current
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   needs, you can help them.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.160]   You may have to adjust your business, you may have to lay off your staff, you may have
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.680]   to hire someone else, but there's always a way to serve.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.280]   And in the middle of a recession or in the middle of a crisis, there's always opportunities
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.680]   if you look for them.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.680]   And so I want you to do your best to ignore the recession as well.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:11.960]   I want to be realistic, but maintain a positive, optimistic attitude, because if you do that,
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.480]   you'll see the opportunities in the middle of it.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.080]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.600]   If you need more help on some of these practical things, remember that I have a number of courses
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.720]   available for you.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.840]   Those are relevant, especially my radical preparedness course.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.440]   You can still buy that at radicalpreparedness.com.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:31.880]   The first one is on food, the next one is on water, or sorry, the first one is on philosophy,
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.440]   then food, then water.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:39.320]   On Monday night, we'll be doing a live class on sanitation.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.160]   And there are a lot of things that you can do to be well prepared in the midst of it.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.840]   And so if you didn't think that was relevant before, it's relevant now.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:52.800]   That course is an astonishingly low price of $29, and I guarantee you, you'll get more
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   value from that.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.680]   I'll be doing an extensive Q&A on Monday evening on the topic of preparedness.
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.800]   And so if you're trying to find something, you can't find it, and you need ideas of what
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.760]   is available, I'll help you with those ideas as well.

[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.920]   Thank you for being here.
