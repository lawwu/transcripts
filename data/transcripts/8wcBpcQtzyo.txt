[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Last time we looked at how non-Christians fight for faith.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   We Christians also fight for faith. We fight for faith because the world
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   and the flesh and the devil conspire to spiritually
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   deaden us. They come at us with sleeping pills, with tranquilizers
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   of relaxation, with the offer of a life filled by the hypnotic
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   trance of digital amusements. And what Jesus
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   wants us to see is that faith and hope and love are the antidotes
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   to the soporific effects of the world always trying to get you to
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   go to sleep. So how do we stay awake?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And how do we fight to stay awake in the entertainment
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   age that we live in? Here's Pastor John preaching in 2005
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   at an outdoor venue, a conference maybe, I'm not sure of the context,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   but you will hear the wind noise at times. Here now is
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Pastor John to explain.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Today is the 80th birthday
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   of Dan Fuller, which doesn't mean anything
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   to most of you, but means a great deal to me.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Because Dan Fuller was for me in 1968,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   69, 70, and 71, God's
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   instrument for turning my world upside down and opening
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   my eyes to the scriptures and the glory of God. So I got
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   on the email yesterday and I wrote him a long letter of
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   appreciation and gratitude, and among the other
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   things that I said, I said, "Dan, salvation
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   is closer to you now than it was the day
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   you believed. And every groan of your 80-year-old
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   body is groaning closer to Jesus. Every
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   heartbeat in your fragile old body is a
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   heartbeat closer to the glory of Jesus Christ."
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And I hope he takes heart in his
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   80-year-old frame. And I hope you take heart from
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   your salvation that is the completion of your redemption with a
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   new body, and no more battle with sin is closer
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   today than it was yesterday, and every groaning of your aching
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   body means someone groaned closer to
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   the glory that is arriving. And then the third thing he says,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   verse 11, first half of the verse, "The hour
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   has come for you to awake from
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   sleep." And you remember what we
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   said about that. Most of the world
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   that is not treasuring Jesus Christ
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   as its supreme treasure is sleepwalking.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Even though their life is very glitzy,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   it's just bombarded every day with
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   advertisements to say, "Do this and you will live," when in
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   fact it's the devil wringing his hand saying, "Do this and you will
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   go sound asleep." Sound
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   asleep to what that son is really saying today. How many people in
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Mount Zio hear the glory of God being declared from the heavens?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Why? Because they spent all night watching television. They've
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   saturated their lives with an entertainment mentality, and the
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   spiritual eyes have grown smaller and smaller
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and smaller until most people without Christ can't
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   see anything glorious in spiritual reality.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And Paul says, "The day has come.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   This is not a time for sleeping. This is not a time for
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   sleepwalking. It's not a time for being like skydivers
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   who, this is like a parable of the world without Christ.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The skydivers are leaping out of their planes and they are
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   watching the air go at 120 miles an hour
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   through their fingers and feeling, "This is the apex
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   of the thrill of life!" But there's
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   just one problem. They have no parachutes.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And the gravity
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   that is pulling them inexorably towards what will happen
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   in about a minute or two is called the wrath of
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   God. Because Jesus said in John 3:36,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   "Those who believe on the sun
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   have eternal life, and those who do not believe
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   on the sun will not taste
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   life, but the wrath of God rests
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   on them." And they think they're so
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   alive. One of our great tasks is to
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   so let the light of the gospel shine that
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   by the power of the Holy Spirit, eyes will wake up to the
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   fact, "Day has come! Christ has come! The Son of Righteousness
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   has risen over Moundsview and over the Twin Cities!"
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Wake up to the glory of your Savior
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and believe Him and enjoy Him. Don't
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   be a sleepwalker. Don't be a sleep
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   skydiver. It's time to wake up. It's time
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   to get dressed. That's what this text is about today.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Get dressed! Take off your pajamas!
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Stop going to work in your pajamas! That's what this
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   text is about today for us and for
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Moundsview. So, we start now at verse 12.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And what we're finding here is that we're being
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   told what to wear as the light has come and
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   what to do in this clothing. Verse
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   12, "The night is far gone, the day is at hand, so then..."
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   You see the logic. "Because it is day,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   so then cast off the works of darkness."
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Pajamas! These are pajamas! "Cast off the works of
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   pajamas." One way to define sin is pajamas.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   You should be embarrassed to go around sinning. I mean, who would go to work
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   in his pajamas? But people go to work in the works of darkness every day.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's day! It's day! Wake up!
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It's day! The King of Kings has come. So, cast off,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   take off the works of darkness and put on...
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And then he chooses a word that is surprising. I didn't expect him
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   to choose this word. It's a word that signals
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   that the Christian life is not just wakeful,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   it's war. You see that word?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   "The day is at hand, so then,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   take off your pajamas," that is the works of darkness,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   "and put on the armor of light." I mean, I would expect him to say
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   put on a shirt or a cloak or dress well for work
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   or something. And he says, "Put on the armor of light." So, out of
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   the blue comes... I mean, we don't just go from pajamas to clothes to armor.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   We go straight from pajamas to armor. What does that say
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   about life? It says life is war. The Christian
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   life is a battle. Though today, oh my,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   the God has been so merciful to give us a foretaste of heaven today, we wonder
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   how could we even think in terms of life as being war and a battle
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and darkness to be overcome. So,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   put off the works of darkness and put on the armor
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   of light. Now, here's my question.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   What is the armor of light and what does putting it on mean?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But let's make the question a little broader. Verse 12 and verse 14
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   both use the word "put on." Notice verse 14.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ." So, now you've got
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   two put-ons. Put on the armor of light when you take off
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   your pajamas of sin and put on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   So, my question really is, what's the relationship between
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   putting on the armor of light and putting on the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   What do those two things mean?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And I think the answer is given in 1 Thessalonians
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   chapter 5 verses 7 and 8. So,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   if you want to go there with me, you can or you can just listen. I read this two weeks
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   ago because 1 Thessalonians 5, 7 and 8 are
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   the closest comparison
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   in all of Paul's writings
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   to what we have here in chapter 13 verses 12 to 14.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   When I read it, you'll hear the relationship. So, listen
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   carefully. 1 Thessalonians 5, 7
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   "Those who sleep, sleep at night, and those
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   who get drunk, get drunk at night. But
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   since we belong to the day, let us be sober,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   having put on" - now there it is - "put on
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   having put on
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   the breastplate" - so now we got armor - "put on armor
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   so we know we're in the same sphere of thought
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   put on the breastplate of faith and love
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   and for a helmet the hope of
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   salvation." So, Paul mentions two pieces of armor
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   breastplate and helmet. We know there are more from Ephesians 6, but that's all he's
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   dealing with here. We got a breastplate, cover your heart and your will
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and we got a helmet, cover your brain because that's the only two, three things the devil
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   is interested in. He wants your heart, he wants your
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   will, he wants your brain, so get yourself covered good here and get yourself
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   covered good here and he says there are three things that this
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   armor stands for - faith, love,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   hope. Sound familiar? These three are the great ones.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Faith, hope and love. So now I come back to
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Romans 13, verse 12 and see if this will help us.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   "So then, let us cast off the works of darkness
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and put on the armor of light." That is, let us put
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   on faith and let us put on hope and let
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   us put on love. In this world of sleepwalking,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   the message is coming at you all day
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   long, every day, from television and from advertising
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and from all other kinds of things to say
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   with regard to God, with regard to Christ, with regard to the
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Bible. And the less you want the Bible, the less you
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   want Jesus, the less you want God, the more effective you know
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   the sleeping pills of the world have been in
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   your life. And what he's saying here now is faith
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and hope and love are
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   the antidotes to the soporific
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   effects of the world, always trying to get you to go to sleep.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   So combat that
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   sleep-producing effect of the world by putting on faith and
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   putting on hope and putting on love.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Yes, faith and hope and love are the antidotes to the soporific effects of
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   the world, always trying to get you to go to sleep.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Powerful. This clip was from an outdoor sermon titled
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ Part 2," preached on August 28,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   2005. If you have a sermon clip to share, email me. Give me your
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio, and make a
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   note of what stands out to you. Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. That's an email address.

[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Well, are my eternal rewards and my eternal
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   inheritance the same thing? One seems to imply that we can get more,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   our rewards. The other seems to imply a more static thing
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   that's out of our hands, our inheritance.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   So are these rewards and our inheritance different things
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   or are they the same thing? I'm your host, Tony Rehnke,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John when we return on Friday
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   for that, and we hope to see you then.
