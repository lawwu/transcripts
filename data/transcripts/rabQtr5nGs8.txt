[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:14.640]   the book of the prophet Isaiah in the first chapter, and reading verses 16, 17 and 18.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:23.120]   Verses 16, 17 and 18 in the first chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:32.000]   Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.520]   Cease to do evil, learn to do well.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:44.560]   Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.680]   Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.600]   Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.720]   Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.280]   Now those who attend here regularly will know that we have been working our way through
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.920]   this chapter in which the prophet, as it were, at the very outset of his great prophetic
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.400]   message, gives a kind of synopsis or summary of the whole of the message which God had
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.840]   given to him to deliver to his fellow countrymen.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   He prophesied to them at a time of trouble and of difficulty.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.720]   Had there been no difficulties, there would never have been any prophets.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.200]   God raised up this succession of men to address the people in the nation of Israel when they
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.560]   were going astray, when they were wandering away from God.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.240]   And the whole object of their message is to show these people why things have gone wrong
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.840]   with them, to indicate to them the source of their troubles, and finally, of course,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.860]   to call them back, to call them to repentance, and to indicate to them God's readiness
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.400]   to receive them and the blessings which he has always ready and waiting for a truly repentant
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   people.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.120]   Well, now I say we have been working our way through that, and we have seen that the main
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.440]   subject has been, of course, inevitably, the whole question of sin.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.720]   The nation is in trouble because of sin.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.960]   And what the prophet does, as the whole of the Bible does, is to analyze sin, to show
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.840]   it for what it really is, to display it in its real colors.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.800]   And we have found that the prophet has been saying quite a number of things about it.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.960]   Sin is that, he says, which makes a man a rebel.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.120]   God addresses the nation and says, "I have brought and nourished and brought up children,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.960]   and they have rebelled against me."
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.920]   Rebellion.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.200]   Sin is also folly.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.960]   It's a monstrous folly.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.320]   The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.600]   But Israel does not know.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.680]   My people does not consider.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.920]   Sin always makes a man a fool.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   But worse than that, it makes him a madman.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.560]   His sin always gets him into trouble, and eventually God punishes him because of the
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560]   trouble.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.600]   Instead of taking the correction as he should, and reasoning on it as he should, he plunges
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.960]   into yet more sin, loses his head.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.920]   Why should he be stricken any more?
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.960]   You will revolt, revolt more and more.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.520]   The whole head is sick and the whole heart faint.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.640]   From the sole of the foot even into the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.680]   bruises and putrefying sores.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.720]   But on the sinner goes, plunging into sin until he's got nothing practically left at
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.720]   all.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   Indeed, he would lose everything.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.120]   Were it not that the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.480]   been as sudden, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.360]   Very well, there are some of the things we've been told.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.680]   And then comes the great call, "Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.960]   Give ear unto the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah."
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.840]   But instead of doing that, as we've seen, and so particularly last Sunday night, instead
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.240]   of doing that, the sinner thinks he's very clever and that he can fool God.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.720]   You see, sin makes a man a hypocrite.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.100]   And a hypocrite is a man who thinks he's fooling God but who only succeeds in fooling himself.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.280]   So what he does is to multiply his sacrifices and his offerings.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.220]   And he says, "Oh, it's all right.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.880]   If I only take an occasional offering to the temple, if I give a good donation to a
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.640]   cause, I'm going to be all right."
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.720]   And God says to him, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices?
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.880]   I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts, and I delight not in
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.160]   the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he-goats.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.640]   When you come to appear before me, who hath required this at your end to tread my courts,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.680]   bring no more vain oblations, and so on?"
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.840]   Well, there it is.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   The sinner is a rebel, he's a fool, he's a madman, he's a hypocrite.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:38.600]   But you know, the final truth about the sinner, the man who is in sin, is that he is utterly
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:50.080]   unreasonable, that he is completely inexcusable, and finally, without any defense at all to
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   offer.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.440]   In other words, we are looking tonight at what I venture to suggest to you is God's
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.320]   final word to an unrepentant sinner.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:10.000]   And the way in which he addresses him is this, "Come now, let us reason together," saith
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.800]   the Lord, "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.400]   be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.520]   Now I want to suggest to you that this is a most extraordinary statement, this final
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.040]   thing that God says to men in sin is perhaps one of the most extraordinary and most astonishing
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.560]   things that God says to men at all.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.720]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.840]   You notice that he addresses an appeal to men, "Come."
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:56.200]   Now there is nothing that is more astonishing than that, that the great and almighty and
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:05.600]   eternal God, existing from eternity to eternity, self-sufficient in himself in the Trinity
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:16.840]   of blessed persons, the God who made man and everything, that he should appeal to men,
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.240]   that he should call upon men still longer and ask them to listen.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.760]   Oh, I say, my dear friends, that there is nothing more wonderful in this whole universe
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:36.240]   tonight in which we find ourselves than the fact that God bothers at all with us.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.440]   He could live without us.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.720]   He did exist without us.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.940]   He is not dependent upon us.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.280]   We have no contribution to make.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.840]   And yet I say he appeals to us, but still more wonderful, that he should appeal to people
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.680]   like these children of Israel, these people that though he had nourished them and brought
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:01.200]   them up have rebelled against him, these people who as it were had spat in his face, spurned
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.760]   his vice divine, desecrated all the sanctities, the people who are guilty of the various things
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.160]   that we have been seeing as we have been working out this picture Sunday by Sunday.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.200]   Here is the amazing thing, I say, that God should still say, "Come," but he does
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.080]   not abandon them.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:27.560]   Finally hand them over to an ultimate reprobate mind from which there is no deliverance and
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.880]   blast them eternally to perdition.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.400]   But you see, there would be no service like this here tonight if God were not like this.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:45.160]   This is the whole basis and foundation of the Christian gospel.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:55.440]   That God, the almighty ever-blessed God, so loved this world as it is, that he gave his
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.360]   only begotten Son.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:04.920]   And indeed the whole message of the Bible is, I say, epitomized in this one word, "Come,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.400]   God appealing to men."
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.800]   You see, he began to do it in the Garden of Eden.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.840]   You remember how when Adam and Eve had sinned and had fallen, God came down into the garden
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.480]   and they ran away and hid themselves.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.520]   And God said, "Adam, where art thou?"
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.400]   It was, "Come, come and speak to me.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.760]   Come and listen to me.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.000]   Come and say what you have got to say for yourself.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.200]   Come."
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.360]   And this, I say, is the great message of the Bible from the very beginning to the very
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   end.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.320]   The great message of the prophets, the message of the apostles, the message of all the preachers
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.760]   in the Christian church throughout the running century.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.440]   It is a word that comes to a world in sin and shame and sorrow and says, "Wait a moment.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.440]   Come now.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.240]   Listen."
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.680]   But above all, of course, it is the great word in the preaching of our blessed Lord
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.440]   and Savior himself.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.040]   This is the miracle and the marvel of grace.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:14.440]   "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.440]   Come.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.360]   It is a great appeal to us.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.560]   It is an announcement that God has not finished with us, that he still has something to say
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   to us.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.960]   He has not abandoned us, though we are guilty of all the folly that we have been considering.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   Very well.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.280]   There is the first thing that strikes us about it.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:42.600]   The second thing is this, that it is an appeal from God and a call from God to come and to
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   reason.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:50.040]   "Come, let us reason together, saith the Lord."
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   Come now.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.480]   "And let us reason together, saith the Lord."
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   You know what it means?
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:05.880]   Well, it is this, that this almighty, eternal God against whom we have sinned and repelled,
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.560]   he stoops down to our level and he says, "Come, let us have a discussion.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   I have spoken to you.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.800]   I have sent my prophets to you.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.160]   I have appealed to you.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   You do not listen.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   Come."
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   He says, "I will come right down.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.160]   Come, let us have it right out.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.160]   Let us have a discussion.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   Let us put you a case.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   I will put my case.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160]   Come, let us reason together."
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   It is a call.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   It is an invitation.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.160]   It is a call.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.800]   It is an invitation to a debate, to a discussion, to a frank statement of the two sides, giving
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.280]   us complete freedom and liberty to say what we want to say, to bring out all our objections
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:47.100]   and all our troubles and all our problems, a complete freedom to state our case to the
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.100]   almighty God.
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.060]   That is what it is.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:12:05.360]   And here we see once more the indescribable fairness and reasonableness of almighty God
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.800]   and his teaching and his message.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.840]   Let no one represent this as God dragooning us.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.240]   He does not.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.120]   God in his sovereign act of salvation does not dragoon a man.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.040]   He persuades him.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.700]   Let us not misunderstand the great doctrine which tells us that a man is saved by grace
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.700]   alone.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.700]   He is not knocked on the head.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.700]   He is not bludgeoned.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:38.100]   His eyes are open to the reasonableness of what God has for us in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:45.780]   Here, I say, is a wonderful display of that, the final reasonableness and fairness of God.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:52.940]   But, oh, think of the infinite condescension that is involved in it all.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.260]   That he, I say, who made all things and who needs nothing from anybody and who has the
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.220]   right and the power, as I am going to show you, to do anything he wills and anything
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:10.260]   he chooses, should nevertheless humble himself, as it were, and meet people like these, these
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.460]   recalcitrant Jews, and say, "Come along then.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.020]   I am going to listen to what you have got to say.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.420]   I am allowing you to speak.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.740]   Bring out all you have got to say.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.020]   Let us listen to every argument you can produce.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.020]   I am ready to listen.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.020]   Come now.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.020]   Let us reason together."
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:32.700]   Condescension, I say.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:39.180]   The ultimate condescension was one when God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.380]   under the law, to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.380]   There he is.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:51.140]   Look at him, Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God, being buffeted by the crowds, Pharisees and
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.900]   scribes putting clever questions to him, arguing and debating, everybody doing it, and he humbled
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:03.060]   himself to that, was ready to enter into this process of reasoning, as it were.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.980]   He humbled himself.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.580]   He took upon him not only the form of a man, but the form of a servant, the meek and lowly,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.580]   the humble Jesus.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.780]   Well, here it is, you see.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:22.620]   In the very words, "Come now, let us reason together," saith our God, saith the Lord,
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:30.680]   we have in and of itself this perfect statement of the very essence of the Christian gospel
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.680]   of salvation.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:39.180]   But we do not leave it at that, because in this expression, "Come now," there is yet
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.780]   a further element.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.740]   It is, as I have been saying to you, a most wonderful condescension and a most wonderful
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.740]   invitation.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:55.540]   But I would be a dishonest expositor if I did not add to that.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.220]   There is another element in this expression, and do you know what it is?
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.340]   It is the element of challenge.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:06.700]   Yes, God is going to give us an opportunity to say anything we have got to say, anything
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:17.260]   we want to say, but remember this, that once you have said it, you have said it, and you
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260]   will never be able to open your mouth again.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.500]   It is a challenge.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.740]   Very well, saith God, you do not listen to my message.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.500]   You are not impressed by what I am saying.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.980]   Very well, then, come along.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:35.340]   I will allow you to say anything you like, and then I will answer.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.820]   Will you answer that if you can?
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.820]   All that is here.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:47.500]   "Come now, let us reason, and let us reason together, saith the Lord."
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:54.660]   Produce all your arguments, and then I will reply to them, and then what will you have
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.660]   to say?
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.340]   In other words, God is here bringing the thing to a head, as I said at the beginning.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.700]   It is his final word.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.700]   It is his last word.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.060]   He says, "No more bothering about.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.060]   Let us come to the point.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.820]   I have sent the messengers.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.820]   I have put the arguments.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.820]   You take no notice."
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.380]   Very well, now then, let us get a final clearing up of this matter.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.500]   It is all in this word.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:25.460]   And in putting it in this way, of course, God is, as I say, unfolding and unmasking
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:35.060]   the final unreasonableness of men in sin, the fact that there is nothing whatsoever
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.260]   to be said for him.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.140]   If you like, I will put that in a different way by putting it like this.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:49.140]   A Christian is a man who has come to see that he has got nothing to say.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.400]   That is what makes a man a Christian.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.180]   A Christian is a man who gives up.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.220]   He gives in.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.500]   He says, "All right, I have been talking, I have been arguing, I have been expressing
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.420]   my difficulties and my problems.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.940]   I have no more to say."
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:13.820]   Like Job, he puts his hand upon his mouth and sees what a fool he has been in all that
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.460]   he has been trying to say.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:22.180]   That is what makes a man a Christian, that he is driven to the corner, that there is
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.580]   no reply, no argument, no plea.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.780]   What makes a man a Christian is that he submits entirely and completely to God's word.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.220]   Here it was in verse 10, "Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.180]   Give heir unto the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah."
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.260]   But then they try to camouflage it by their burnt offerings.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.260]   Now they see it.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.260]   "No more.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.900]   I say nothing.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:54.100]   He submits utterly and completely to the word of God, to the law of our God."
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.500]   Well now then, my friends, let's look at this as God puts it before us here through the
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.260]   mouth of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:09.260]   What is this argument that a man becomes persuaded of when he becomes a Christian?
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:14.540]   What is it that finally breaks down every resistance and opposition and makes a man
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.700]   say, "I have nothing more to say.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.140]   I believe"?
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.140]   What is it?
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.140]   Well, it is all here.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.020]   Let me put it in the form of three hurried principles.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.260]   The first is this.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.580]   The rightness of God's demands on us.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.620]   These things need to be proved.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.660]   The rightness of God's demand.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.860]   Men and women are disputing this.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.660]   What right has God to do this?
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.380]   It was the old temptation of the devil at the beginning.
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.500]   Hath God said that you shouldn't eat of that fruit?
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.900]   What right has God to say?
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.900]   There's an objection.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.180]   Mankind feels it isn't right.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.660]   But here God justifies his demands upon us.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.420]   "Come," he says, "let us reason together."
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.100]   He says, "What I'm asking is this.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.300]   Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.500]   Cease to do evil, learn to do well.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.820]   Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow."
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:22.180]   God's demands on us, I say, and they're right and righteous.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.180]   On what grounds?
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:29.580]   Well, I mustn't keep you, but the Bible is full of answers to that question.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.460]   God, you see, is our maker.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.060]   It is he who made us, not we ourselves.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.220]   He's given us life and being and all things.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.740]   He created us for himself.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.100]   He created us for his own pleasure.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.140]   We were not involved.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.540]   We were not consulted.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.780]   We haven't produced ourselves.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.020]   Clever though we are, we haven't produced ourselves.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.340]   God made man.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.300]   And he made man in a particular manner and for a particular purpose.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.300]   He made man that man might have companionship with him.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:09.420]   He made man in his own image in order that through him he might govern his universe,
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.540]   that man was to be the Lord of creation.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.380]   And he was made, obviously, for the enjoyment of God.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:20.580]   And God is perfectly at liberty to do so.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:26.900]   He made man and he endowed him with certain faculties and with certain powers.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.900]   He gave him a mind.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.900]   He gave him a reason.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.300]   He gave him an understanding.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.220]   He made him essentially different from the animals.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.820]   Animals live according to their lusts, their instincts, their desires, not so man.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.460]   Man is given a critical faculty.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.380]   Man is given the power of looking on at himself and of making estimates.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.500]   Man is able to curb and to control himself.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.500]   He's different.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.500]   He's the Lord of creation.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   He isn't a part of it.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.500]   He's the Lord of it.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.980]   God, in other words, gave something of his own power over to man.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.020]   He couldn't have given him a greater compliment.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.140]   And not only that, he gave him freedom.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.780]   Man as he was originally made was absolutely free.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:14.980]   Man as he was made had free will, complete freedom of choice.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:21.460]   And not only that, God set before men a very glorious possibility.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:27.460]   He told him that it was possible for him not to die, that if he lived this life of obedience
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.420]   he would be glorified and he would never die at all.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.020]   God gave men that possibility.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:39.780]   It was possible for men never to die if only he obeyed the commandments of God.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:46.060]   Well now that is how God made man and set him in this world.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.780]   And I say that God is arguing that he has a perfect right, therefore, to lay down conditions
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.620]   for men and to make demands of him.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.020]   There is nothing derogatory to men in that.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.620]   There is nothing derogatory to men to ask him to acknowledge the Lordship of the Almighty.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.520]   We recognize that.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.700]   We all pay allegiance to the crown.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.820]   We don't object to that.
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.820]   We don't resent it.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.100]   We don't say it's wrong.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.060]   We recognize it as an essentially just and equitable principle.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.060]   It's absolutely right.
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.700]   Life can't go on without it.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.700]   There must be authority.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.700]   There must be government.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.820]   And therefore, there must be recognition of it.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.380]   We'll multiply all that by infinity.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.220]   And there's man under God.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.980]   It's no insult to finite men to ask him to obey the everlasting and the eternal and the
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.260]   almighty God.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.580]   There's nothing derogatory in this.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.460]   But then we can go beyond it.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:53.140]   What God demands of us is something that is essentially a right and good in and of itself.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.140]   What am I talking about?
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.780]   Well, I'm thinking at the moment in particular of the Ten Commandments.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.420]   You remember you divide it into two tables.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:08.100]   The first table has respect to men's relationship to God.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.460]   We shall worship God and honor him and not take his name in vain and not bow down to
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:19.060]   any graven image and not break God's day but honor it and so on.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.660]   What's wrong in that, my friends?
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:28.620]   What's wrong, I ask again, in bowing down in worship before the everlasting God?
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.340]   It's essentially right.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.460]   But then come to your second table.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.380]   Honor thy father and mother.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.620]   Have you objection to that?
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.820]   Thou shalt not kill.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.820]   Any objection?
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.820]   Thou shalt not steal.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.820]   Any objection?
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.820]   Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.700]   Any objection?
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.500]   What is the objection?
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.820]   What's wrong about these things?
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.700]   Thou shalt not covet.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.100]   Thou shalt not bring a false accusation.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.100]   What's wrong with this?
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.380]   What's your objection to all this?
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.940]   Is there anything wrong in God in making demands like this upon us?
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.580]   Or take them as they put here?
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.100]   Wash you, make you clean.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.740]   God wants us to be clean.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.380]   He wants us to be pure.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.860]   Have you any objection to that?
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:20.100]   As David puts it in that 51st Psalm, "Thou desirest truth in the inward parts."
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.100]   What's wrong with that?
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.660]   Wouldn't you like to have a clean heart?
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.100]   A heart which never has a vile, impure imagination and never an impure thought?
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.100]   Wouldn't you like to have it?
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.100]   What's wrong with it?
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.100]   That's what God wants.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.980]   Learn to do well, he says.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.260]   Seek judgment.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.260]   Relieve the oppressed.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.940]   Judge the fatherless.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.340]   Plead for the widow.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:45.180]   My dear friends, if only everybody in the world were practicing these things tonight,
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.660]   this world would be a perfect world.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.260]   If only everybody lived the Ten Commandments and the moral law and the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.740]   there'd be no threat of war, they wouldn't be making bombs, this whole world wouldn't
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.620]   be in a state of tension and alarm.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.900]   No, no.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.340]   If only everybody lived as God asks us to live, the world would be paradise.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.020]   It would be perfect.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.420]   The essential rightness of God's demands.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.820]   Come now, come, let us reason together.
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.780]   Where is the council for the opposition, for the defense?
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.780]   Where are you?
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:21.780]   What have you got to say?
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.180]   Where's your objection to the righteous demands of God?
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.500]   Why do you object to having truth in your inward parts?
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.100]   Why do you object to being told you should have a clean heart?
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.460]   What's the objection to the life that was lived by the Son of God himself when he was
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.460]   in this world?
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.460]   What is it?
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.180]   There's no objection to it.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.940]   It is essentially right.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.740]   Answer if you can.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.740]   You cannot answer.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.740]   There is no answer.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:57.860]   Very well, there is the first thing, but let me go on to the second.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:05.460]   Having established the righteousness of God's demands upon us and their essential rightness,
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:13.500]   let us go on to consider the essential justice of God's punishment of our failure and sin.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.860]   That's the matter at issue.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.900]   Because here he is threatening punishment.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.700]   He threatens punishment in the whole of the Bible.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:28.060]   You take the element of punishment out of the Bible, how much have you got left?
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.420]   There never would have been a salvation were it not for punishment.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:38.100]   There never would have been the cross on Calvary were it not for the wrath of God against sin.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.100]   These things go together.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.100]   They are indissolubly linked.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.900]   The righteousness of God's judgment, the justice of God's judgment.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.100]   "Come," he says, "I've been threatening you.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.220]   I've been telling you what's going to happen."
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.020]   Now then, he says, "Produce all your objections, anything that you can think of against this.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.460]   Here is my case against you.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.820]   Answer it who can."
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.620]   The first is this, that God has the right to be the judge of all the earth, and he is
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.980]   the judge of all the earth.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.900]   He has the right to it, of course, for the reasons I've already given you, that he is
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.860]   God, our Maker.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.500]   He is the great lawgiver.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.900]   And he therefore has the right to be the judge of the whole universe, and he's told us that
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.900]   he is.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:32.820]   Not only that, God has made it very plain and clear from the very beginning that he
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:39.220]   will punish sin and disobedience and rebellion and transgression.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.140]   Now take our first fathers.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:47.380]   Take Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.980]   God made it very plain and clear to them.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:54.420]   He said, "Now you live according to my commandments, and I will bless you, and you will have that
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.580]   wonderful gift of glorification and immortality.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:07.540]   But if you eat of this tree of the knowledge of good and evil, dying you shall die.
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.380]   You'll be driven out of the garden."
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.580]   He told them.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.820]   He warned them.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.420]   God has from the very beginning established this principle of judgment, and he has told
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:23.060]   us exactly and precisely what the terms of the judgment are going to be.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.620]   Would anything be fairer?
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:29.460]   If God suddenly landed judgment upon us without our ever having been forewarned, well then
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.460]   it would be unjust.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.820]   But God has told us there is no plea of ignorance.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.740]   The law is open before us.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.940]   Everything God wants we've already considered.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.860]   And God has said, "I will judge you in terms of what I made you and what I've asked of
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.900]   you."
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:52.540]   Very well, let us look at ourselves in the judgment.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.900]   How do you find yourself?
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.140]   Look at your hands.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.540]   Look at your heart.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.180]   God's verdict is this, "Wash you, make you clean."
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.180]   What about your actions?
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.220]   "Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.780]   Cease to do evil.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:17.660]   Learn to do well."
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.100]   Let's examine ourselves.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.100]   God made man a living soul.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.100]   Man is not an animal.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.100]   He's got a soul.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.900]   He's got an eternal spirit.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.020]   He's meant for God and for the life of companionship with God.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.180]   He's meant to reflect something of God's glory as he lives in this world.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.820]   He's meant to live that life indicated in the Ten Commandments and elsewhere.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.580]   My friends, what have we done?
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.960]   What is the result?
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:48.100]   What do we find when we examine ourselves in the light of these things?
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.740]   What of your soul?
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.620]   What of your knowledge of God?
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.100]   What of your life?
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.580]   Don't you see the need of washing?
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.420]   Don't you see the stains?
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.700]   Don't you see the mud and the mire of the world hot upon us, covering us without and
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:12.380]   within there is no health in us?
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.940]   Here is the judgment, our attitude to God, and then our life as we've lived it.
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.060]   Oh, I mustn't keep you.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.460]   Isaiah answers the question for us himself in the sixth chapter.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.060]   You remember that great vision that he had?
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:31.100]   You see, it's so difficult for us to visualize the judgment, isn't it?
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.540]   So difficult for us to visualize God.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.100]   And the clever men today are trying to tell us that we can't, that God is death or something
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   like that.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.900]   Who can understand such a thought?
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.100]   It's nonsense.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.780]   The Bible tries to help us by painting pictures.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:52.620]   In the year that King Isaiah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.580]   up, and His train filled the temple.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.780]   Above it stood the seraphims, each one had six wings.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.580]   With twain He covered His face, with twain He covered His feet, and with twain did He
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.580]   fly.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:11.740]   And one cried unto another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.940]   The whole earth is full of His glory."
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.980]   And the posts of the door moved at the voice of Him that cried, and the house was filled
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.980]   with smoke.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:31.020]   Then said I, "Woe is me, for I am undone.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.580]   I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:43.220]   And mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.300]   Have you ever visualized yourself in the presence of God, my dear friend?
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.060]   Isaiah merely had a dim and distant vision.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:55.500]   Can you imagine what it is to stand before the burning fire and look at that light?
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:02.700]   God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.780]   Surely there is only one thing to say that is none righteous.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.460]   No, not one.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:16.740]   Before you and I can stand in the presence of God, we must be clean.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.060]   Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.140]   Or who shall stand in His holy place?
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:31.380]   He that hath clean hands and a pure heart.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.620]   Have you got it?
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.980]   Can you cleanse yourself?
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:42.940]   Wash you, make you clean, get rid of the stains, get rid of the blots, cleanse your heart.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.780]   Rend your hearts and not your garments.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.980]   Cleanse your heart, you unrighteous.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.500]   Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.500]   Cease to do evil.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.460]   That is the demand of God.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:03.500]   Can you get rid of the guilt of your past sins?
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.820]   Can you wash yourself and make yourself clean?
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:14.440]   Can you purify your heart and renew a right spirit within yourself?
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.540]   Can you stop sinning?
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.420]   Can you do good?
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.700]   Can you learn to do well?
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.820]   Can you live life as Christ lived it?
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.660]   Can you honour the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660]   Can you do it?
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.660]   You are called upon to do it.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.660]   This is the demand.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:36.620]   And if you can't, you are damned, you are condemned, you are a failure, you are lost.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.780]   What have you to say?
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.140]   You believe in free will, you believe in the power of men.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.940]   You think a man can make himself fit to stand in the presence of God.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.460]   Well, very well, that is what you must produce.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:58.020]   You must produce a man with a clean hand, pure heart.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.540]   Can you do it?
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.700]   Can anybody do it?
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:09.180]   How shall a man be just with God?
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:13.620]   Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots?
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:19.620]   Can you get rid, in the words of Shakespeare, of these damned spots, the blood that is upon
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.620]   us in some shape or form, every one of us?
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.060]   Out, out, damned spot!
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.620]   Can you do so?
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.260]   If you can't, you can't stand in the presence of God.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.540]   That is what God demands, my friend.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:42.460]   God himself is light and holy and pure, and in him is no darkness at all, and he cannot
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.020]   admit into his presence anything that is unlike that.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.900]   It is impossible, of course.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.100]   Darkness can't dwell with light, black can't dwell with white, impurity can't dwell with
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.100]   purity.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.100]   They are self-contradictory.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:35:02.780]   The purity, the light of God, shrivels everything else into nothing.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.380]   And the holy God announces his judgment.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:13.540]   He made us with the possibility of being able to spend eternity in the glory with him and
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.540]   never die.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.660]   Man was not made to die.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.140]   He was made for God and for that glory.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:27.020]   He was made for immortality.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:36.380]   But as the result of the rebellion and the sin and the fall, he finds himself unclean.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:41.380]   There is none righteous now, not one at all, who has sinned and come short of the glory
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:45.780]   of God.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:56.580]   And when God announces judgment, there is no plea, for we have all sinned against him
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.900]   and done so deliberately, and we're all unclean without and within.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.220]   Oh yes, David understood it, you see.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:10.460]   When David repented and came to himself, he said this, "Against thee, thee only, have
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:15.500]   I sinned and done this evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.060]   speakest and be clear when thou judgest."
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.460]   "Oh God," said David, "I'm not trying to justify myself.
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.180]   I want to justify you.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.100]   I deserve nothing but damnation.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.740]   I've been a cad, I've been an adulterer, I've been a murderer.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.900]   God, I've sinned against you, and I have nothing to offer in my own behalf as a plea.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.260]   I want to justify you when you speak and clear you when you judge."
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.900]   There's a man who's seen the truth.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.820]   There's a man who's repented.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.540]   There's a man who says, "There's no reply.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.620]   I've reasoned with you, O Lord, and there's nothing more to be said.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.620]   I gave in.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:37:00.620]   You're just if you blot me out forever and forever."
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:06.220]   Very well, we've seen the rightness of God's demands and the justice of God's judgment
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:13.380]   and punishment, but you know the thing that finally silences everybody is this, the grace
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.700]   of God's offer.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.940]   You see, that's why these verses must be taken together.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.780]   Wash you, make you clean, and you can't do it.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.140]   Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.140]   Cease to do evil.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.140]   You can't.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.140]   Learn to do well.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.140]   You can't.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.180]   Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.180]   And if you do, then you'll be fit to stand before me.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.900]   But nobody can do it.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:43.760]   And God would be fully justified if he blotted us out of existence once and forever and to
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.260]   all eternity.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.780]   But listen, he says, "Come on, let's go on.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   I haven't finished.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.780]   You're silent.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:52.780]   You can't speak now.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.260]   Of course you can't.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.260]   My demands are right.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.900]   My justice is right and absolutely just.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.380]   But come, listen to me.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.380]   We haven't finished.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.660]   Come, let us reason together.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.660]   My case isn't ended.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.860]   I've got more to say.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.860]   Listen.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:10.460]   I have grace to offer you.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:16.340]   Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:21.300]   Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   What's he mean?
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:27.460]   Oh, this is God's final word to man.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:32.020]   When he has convinced us and convicted us of the righteousness of his demands and the
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:39.260]   justice of his punishment, and we see ourselves lost and damned, God comes to us and says,
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.260]   "Listen.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.260]   Give in to me.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.620]   Admit, confess, repent.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.060]   Cast yourself on my mercy.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.660]   Give up, give in.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.580]   Stop pleading, stop excusing.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.380]   Stop trying to deceive me with your hypocrisy.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.940]   Acknowledge your sin and your guilt.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   Fall before me in utter self-condemnation.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:08.460]   Say unto me, as that poor publican said who went up into the temple to pray with the Pharisee,
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.900]   'God be merciful to me, a sinner.'
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.340]   And you know what will happen?
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:23.780]   Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:32.220]   Though they be as crimson, red like crimson, they shall become as wool."
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.220]   What's he mean?
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.780]   Well, here it is.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:43.300]   If you and I acknowledge our sin and submit to the word of the Lord and the law of our
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:50.900]   God, what he will give you is free and full forgiveness.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:55.100]   Listen.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:04.900]   Though your sins have been as deeply dyed as to be scarlet, they will be so dealt with
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.340]   that they'll be as white as snow.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:15.500]   Though you've sinned until your sin is as red as crimson, it shall be as white as wool.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:20.260]   This is the amazing thing that God offers us in the blessed gospel of his Son.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.980]   This is just a prophecy of it, you see.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.980]   It's nothing else.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.860]   And what God is here saying is this.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:32.900]   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.660]   us from all unrighteousness.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:42.100]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:47.980]   should not perish but have everlasting life, free, full forgiveness.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:54.020]   Your sins blotted out as a thick cloud, cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness, cancelled
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.820]   out of the ledgers of heaven once and forever as if they'd never been there.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:08.060]   Oh, and I do want to bring this out tonight, this Sunday night before Good Friday.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:15.220]   If the worst and the deepest sinner in London happens to be in this congregation, oh, I'm
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:21.780]   proud and happy and rejoice in being able to tell you that your sins can be forgiven
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:26.740]   as fully and as freely as the best person who's entered in here tonight.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.940]   You may have touched every depth of hell in London.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.780]   You may have committed every sin that man's ever heard of.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:39.900]   Though your sins be as scarlet, I assure you here tonight in the name of God that if you
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.460]   but recognize and acknowledge it and give up and give in and believe in the Son of God,
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.260]   they'll be blotted out.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.500]   They'll become as white as snow.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:56.780]   Though they be as red as crimson, they shall become as white as wool.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.780]   It'll be entirely removed.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:04.140]   Free, full, absolute forgiveness.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.140]   That's what he's offering.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.140]   What else?
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.940]   Well, in addition to forgiveness, what we call justification, which means this, you
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.700]   see, and it's a very wonderful thing.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.700]   I'm so glad that he puts it like this.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.780]   It's to me the greatest comfort of all.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:25.460]   He doesn't say, "Though your sins be as scarlet, I'll just erase them and you won't
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.740]   be able to see them any longer."
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.660]   No, no, there's a transformation here.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.860]   They shall be as white as snow.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.580]   Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:38.380]   This means, you see, that when you believe in Christ, you're not only forgiven, you
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.260]   are justified.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.260]   What does that mean?
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:47.420]   It means this, that God takes the righteousness of his own Son and puts it on me.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.500]   He takes all that's evil in me and puts it under him, and he punished it in him, and
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.820]   then he takes his righteousness and he puts it on me.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:59.500]   I've got a robe of whiteness, of pure whiteness like snow, as white as wool.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.620]   This is the righteousness of Christ.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.180]   It means this.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:08.500]   It doesn't matter what you've been until the moment you entered this service.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.220]   If you've seen your sin and your hopelessness tonight and are a believer now in the Lord
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.220]   Jesus Christ, do you know?
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:22.420]   God now looks upon you as if you'd never sinned at all.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.580]   He's blotted out what you were.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.420]   You are old men, died with Christ.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.300]   It's no longer in existence.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.780]   And God has put this robe of righteousness upon you.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.780]   And he looks at you, he doesn't see you, he sees Christ covering you with his perfect
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.060]   spotless robe of righteousness.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:46.060]   White as snow, white as wool, justification, God clothing us with the righteousness of
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.060]   his Son.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.060]   What else?
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:54.740]   Well, he renews us, makes us new men and women, begins to bless us as our Father.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.500]   These are the things that God is offering.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.220]   He says, "Come, let us reason together now."
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.460]   And when he's exposed you and you can't answer, and you see you can do nothing, "It's
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.260]   all right," says God, "I haven't finished.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.260]   I've silenced you.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.260]   Listen to me now.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.260]   Stop speaking.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.260]   You can't speak anymore.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.260]   You've got nothing to say.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.260]   Well, listen to me.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.260]   This is what I want to do.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:18.460]   This is what I will do for you.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:25.060]   I will blot out your transgressions and your sins as a thick cloud.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.820]   I will reconcile you unto myself.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.460]   I'll make you as white as snow.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.980]   I'll give you the purity of wool.
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.500]   I'll put a new nature within you.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:38.340]   I'll make you a partaker of the divine nature, and there's no evil or sin in that.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.340]   And I'll give you a new start and a new life, and I'll put my Spirit in you, and I'll
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.980]   lead you on and eventually receive you unto myself."
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:45.980]   That's what he's offering.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.980]   "Listen," he says.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:47.980]   "Accept it.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.980]   Reason.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:49.980]   Listen."
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:58.300]   But you know the most wonderful thing about it all?
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:07.860]   It is not only and not simply what God offers to do for us.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:15.540]   It is the amazing way in which he's made it possible for himself to do it.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:23.020]   How can God turn these sins that are as scarlet and make them as white as snow?
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.980]   How does he take my sins, which are red like crimson, and turn them into the whiteness
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.620]   and the purity of wool?
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.900]   How does he do it?
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.740]   I know he's God, and I know he's almighty.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:42.220]   I know he's the Creator, but how can he do this?"
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:47.300]   And there's only one answer to the question.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.900]   He did it by sending his only begotten Son into this world.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.900]   He left heaven.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.420]   He took unto him human nature.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:00.140]   He humbled himself and took on him the form of a servant and endured the contradiction
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:06.340]   of sinners against himself.
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:13.380]   He lived in this world a life like yours and like mine, suffered endless indignities and
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:19.340]   buffetings.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:30.980]   He took him to the Garden of Gethsemane, where in this terrible struggle to turn the crimson
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:46.900]   into snow and the scarlet into the whiteness of wool, he was sweating drops of blood.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.340]   That's the chemistry of it.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.340]   How did he do it?
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:58.860]   How did he turn the scarlet into the whiteness of snow and the crimson into the whiteness
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.940]   of wool?
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:19.900]   The answer, I say, is the alchemy of Gethsemane, the blood of Jesus Christ, and the sweat and
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:36.780]   all that was involved, and the cross, the shame and the suffering, the ignominy, the
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:49.900]   mocking rude, the crown of thorns, everything that happened on that cross on Calvary's
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.900]   Hill.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.300]   That's what it cost.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.900]   That is what did it.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:03.020]   That's the miracle divine that changes the scarlet into the whiteness of the snow and
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.780]   the crimson into wool.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:09.980]   God is able to make this free offer.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.340]   Here it is as I close.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.980]   I must have clean hands.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.380]   I must have a pure heart.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.060]   I can't do it.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.060]   Haven't you tried to do it?
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.940]   We've all tried, and we've none of us succeeded and never can, and yet I can't
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.220]   stand before God unless I have them.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.740]   Oh, how can I cleanse myself?
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:34.060]   My hands, my heart, my whole being, my spirit.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.060]   It's impossible.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.060]   There's only one way.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.060]   Listen.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:42.060]   Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness, according unto the multitude
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.900]   of thy tender mercies.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.060]   Blot out my transgressions.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:53.420]   Wash me, wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.340]   I can't do it.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:01.460]   Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:07.020]   Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:14.380]   Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:20.500]   There's the cry of the Old Testament, the cry of David in sin, the cry of every condemned
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   sinner.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.500]   We cannot.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:26.060]   It's hopeless.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:33.860]   We can but cry out to God for mercy and for compassion.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:41.220]   And when we do so, he will point us to his dear Son and say, "There's the answer.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:48.420]   Believe in him and though your sins were as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:52.820]   Though they be as red as crimson, they shall be as white as wool."
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.820]   Is it true?
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.820]   It's enough.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:50:00.860]   His blood can make the foulest clean.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:06.660]   His blood availed for me.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:10.540]   My friends, my privilege is to tell you this.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:18.140]   There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins and sinners plunged
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:24.540]   beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:32.140]   The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:43.140]   And there am I, as vile as he, washed all my guilt away.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:54.060]   There is power, power, wonder-working power in the precious blood of the Lamb.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.900]   Have you heard God's invitation?
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:01.220]   Come now, let us reason together.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:05.540]   You've heard his demand, you've heard the terms of his judgment.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.820]   Where are you?
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.820]   Can you justify yourself?
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.060]   Have you any objection?
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.140]   Have you any plea?
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.340]   Have you any excuse?
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.500]   Have you any argument?
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.300]   Have you anything to say?
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:24.580]   If you haven't, listen to what God says and respond and say this.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:36.020]   I hear thy welcome voice that calls me, Lord, to thee for cleansing in thy precious blood
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.380]   that flowed on Calvary.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:44.300]   I am coming, Lord, coming now to thee.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:50.740]   Wash me, cleanse me in the blood that flowed on Calvary.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.820]   God's demand says, wash you, make you clean.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.260]   I cannot.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:02.300]   Wash me, cleanse me in the blood that flowed on Calvary.
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.460]   Say that to him.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:07.020]   Say this to him.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:15.180]   Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bidst
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:21.820]   me come to thee, O Lamb of God, I come.
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:33.220]   Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot, to thee whose blood can
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:42.940]   cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.180]   Come my friends.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:50.180]   If you've never come before, come tonight and you know a day will come in your history
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.620]   when you'll be with a shining bright crowd of people of all nations and kindreds and
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.740]   tongues with amazing white robes.
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:02.940]   And somebody will say, who are these?
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.820]   Who's that?
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:15.500]   And one of the angels will answer, oh, that's that man, that woman who in Westminster Chapel
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:24.020]   in London on April the 7th, 1963, suddenly saw his and her wildest, saw the spots, the
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:30.100]   blots, the uncleanness, the foulness, realized that he could do nothing about it and saw
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:38.100]   the condemnation of God, and there and then heard God's offer and accepted it and washed
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:42.180]   his robes in the blood of the Lamb.
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:47.340]   That's the explanation.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:58.060]   Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot, to thee whose blood can
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:08.820]   cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.180]   I've heard the reason.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.180]   I give in.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.260]   I accept it.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.020]   I believe it.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:23.540]   Wash me, cleanse me in thy blood which flowed on Calvary.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:29.420]   If you have never said that to him, say it now, and he'll wash you and he'll make you
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:35.420]   as white as snow and as white as wool.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.100]   Amen.
