[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Are there times in the Christian life when, for whatever reason, God chooses to withhold
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.640]   His presence from us, and thus nullifies all hope that we would experience Godward affections?
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.760]   The Puritans seem to operate from this assumption.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.260]   Pastor John, if this is true, if God withdraws from the Christian at times, thus making joy
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.160]   in God impossible, doesn't then Christian hedonism, the call to be happy in God, doesn't
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.680]   this plea just heap guilt on such a person?
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:40.360]   I do believe that God lifts His hand, or another image would be covers us with darkness at
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.880]   times.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.400]   I don't think Christian hedonism adds guilt.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.120]   I think Christian hedonism names guilt.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.520]   In other words, it is proper to feel bad that we're not rejoicing in the Lord.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.480]   That's part of what darkness is.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.680]   We can't rejoice, and we feel bad we can't rejoice.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.400]   Christian hedonism is not going to withdraw the biblical statements, "Rejoice always."
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.920]   It's not going to withdraw the biblical mandate to be sorrowful, yet always rejoicing, as
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.600]   though, "Okay, we'll just change the Bible so you don't feel bad in this moment."
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.480]   Instead, what Christian hedonism does is say, "I know what you're talking about."
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.800]   This view of joy is not a naÃ¯ve view of joy.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.120]   It's not a view that assumes we don't have seasons of horrible darkness.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.440]   My favorite passage of Scripture in this regard of darkness and seasons of desertion is Micah
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.360]   7, 8, and 9.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.880]   I preached a sermon a few years ago in which I used the phrase "gutsy guilt."
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880]   It goes like this.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.800]   This is Micah 7, 8.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.080]   "Rejoice not over me, O my enemy.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.120]   When I fall, I shall rise.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.400]   When I sit in darkness, the Lord will be a light for me."
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.920]   He's confessing right there, "I do sit in darkness."
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920]   It's not bright right now.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   It's a cloud.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.600]   So verse 9, "I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.040]   Him until He pleads my cause and executes judgment for me.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.120]   He will bring me out to the light.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.480]   I shall look upon His vindication."
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.240]   That is one of the most magnificent, realistic statements of what it means to be a justified
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.480]   sinner in darkness.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   It's an unbelievably gutsy experience of guilt.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.600]   That's why I'm resisting the statement that we shouldn't feel guilty or shouldn't
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.120]   add to guilt by acknowledging biblical truth.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.240]   We embrace our guilt.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.640]   When I am discouraged, defeated, dark, and feel little joy, it's not going to help
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.280]   me to have a naive view of my own sin and say, "Oh, I'm not so guilty after all."
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   I am guilty.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.120]   Then the question is, "What do you do with your guilt?"
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.000]   He says, "When I fall, I shall rise.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.040]   When I sit in darkness, the Lord is still my light even though I can't see it.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.840]   I'm going to bear this indignation because I've sinned against Him until," and there's
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.480]   this lapse of time, "He pleads my cause and executes judgment for me."
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.600]   What I want to say to the person in darkness, even lengthy darkness, is keep holding on
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.400]   to the hope that God is going to vindicate you and bring you out to the light.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.600]   The text that I have probably used most often with discouraged, dark saints, including myself,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120]   is Psalm 40.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.680]   When I came to Bethlehem 32+ years ago, one of the first sermons I preached was called
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   In the Pits with the King, based on Psalm 40, where it says, "I waited patiently
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.000]   for the Lord.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.280]   He heard my cry.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.480]   He lifted me up out of the miry pit, out of the bog.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.800]   He set my feet upon a rock.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.360]   He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.840]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.680]   I asked people when I caught them that, "How long do you think they waited for the Lord?"
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.520]   I waited for the Lord.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.460]   David is saying, "I was in a pit.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.580]   My feet were in muck.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.400]   There was darkness over my head, and God wasn't showing up."
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   He waited.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.240]   That's what I want to say, that we wait.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.040]   Christian hedonists say we ought to be happy.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040]   We're not.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   That's bad.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.680]   We acknowledge it's bad, and we're not going to despair because we are bad.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.560]   We're looking away in the darkness, looking away to Christ, and we're waiting for God's
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   timing to restore the joy of our salvation.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.240]   When he does it, then we realize, "Okay, there was a purpose for that, because now
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.280]   people are seeing and putting their trust in the Lord."
