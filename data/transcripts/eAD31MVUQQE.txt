[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   - How should people think about what to eat?
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.240]   - So, yeah, I have what I call a plate method, and it's just simple because it works for
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.240]   me.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.000]   And, again, if you're struggling with real eating issues, these mechanisms become admittedly
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.280]   less effective because maybe you have emotionally triggered eating and you can't stop at one
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.280]   plate.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.720]   I mean, you could get the plate right, but if the portions are out of control--
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720]   - The plate.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.720]   - Right.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.720]   - Plate has a dimensionality of height.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.720]   - Height, too.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.720]   Or multiple plates.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.720]   You know, like second and third.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.720]   - Or plate.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720]   - Or plate, right?
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.280]   Like then, you know, all these things can be challenged, but what I say is when you
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.540]   have your plate, then you just simply look at it as like a clock, right?
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.240]   And if you just make a 9.20 on the clock, so one arm goes over to the nine and one of
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.480]   the arms goes over to 20, well, then you're basically, you're gonna take the second largest
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.720]   portion of that, because then you're gonna make a line towards 12 o'clock, too.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.780]   And the largest portion is gonna be your fibrous carbohydrates.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.320]   So that's the green vegetables, right?
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.740]   So whether it be broccoli or Brussels sprouts or asparagus or, you know, pick your favorites.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.400]   You know, like those are the ones that give us a lot of the micronutrients we need.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.800]   They're the ones that are generally accepted as more healthy and they're also gonna provide
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.520]   the fiber that's gonna be both beneficial in terms of its impact on insulin and also
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.200]   just through filling you up, right?
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.080]   And then I take the next largest portion of that and I devote that towards protein.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.720]   And I think it's really important, especially for anybody active.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.040]   The more active you are, the more you embark on trying to build muscle.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.620]   You're gonna need to have protein in every meal, so I have that.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.300]   And again, you know, we're talking cleaner sources of protein, but like you'll never
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.440]   find like boiled chicken on my plate.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.520]   Like I ditched those days when I was 16 or 15 or 16.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.880]   Like I realized after reading those bodybuilding magazines that maybe the low fat thing stuck
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.560]   for too long or the no fat thing stuck for too long.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.000]   But the boiled chicken and, you know, a steamed broccoli thing, that ended quickly for me
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.220]   because I realized I'm not gonna eat this forever.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.840]   So I'll have some sort of fish or chicken, but it will be cooked in a way that's like,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.000]   you know, it's got maybe some sauce on it or it's got some, maybe it's tomato sauce,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.920]   anything to just make it a little bit more palatable and interesting without blowing
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.340]   the value of the meal.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.840]   And then that last portion is where I put my starchy carbohydrates.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.480]   And again, that's the part that some people will say exclude them entirely because they're
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.680]   not healthy or they don't work for you or they're not, you know, beneficial long-term.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.880]   For me, it's been a godsend.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.400]   And I do think I'm like most people, my body craves those carbohydrates.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.080]   I choose things like sweet potatoes, which is my favorite, you know, or I'll have rice
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.080]   or I'll have pasta.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.240]   I'm Italian, so I like pasta and like I will have those things.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.560]   I'm not excluding them, but I don't put them in the portions that you would generally find.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.120]   You know, my wife and I will go out and we'll go to the restaurant sometimes like because
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.200]   we travel quite a bit or used to at least with baseball too.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.680]   There's a Cheesecake Factory everywhere you went and I love Cheesecake Factory, but like
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.360]   the way they structure meals is it's all rice on the bottom and a little bit of chicken
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   on top.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.400]   And I mean, it's a plate full of rice that you wouldn't find me make a plate that way.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.920]   I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate to the starchy carbohydrate.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.680]   And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility in terms of portion control because those
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.920]   are the foods, again, probably, you know, dopamine driven that are most easily overeaten.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.320]   I always ask the question, how was the last time you ate 10 chicken breasts at a meal?
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.120]   Like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three, but you could eat a whole hell
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.800]   of a lot of carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates, because they're just so satisfying.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.560]   And I think those triggers, as you said, that want more, like that's what happens, right?
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.080]   You just keep, even when you're feeling full, you want more.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.120]   And that's the biggest danger to carbohydrates.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.840]   So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them, then you can still enjoy them.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.080]   If you can't develop that discipline for whatever reason, then maybe they do become something
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.760]   that you have to work yourself around or adopt a different eating style.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.520]   And as I said, I'm never to the point where I'm not trying to be dogmatic in my approach.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.720]   I'm always trying to say, this is how I do it and I'm a believer in it, just like everyone
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.680]   else is a believer in their method.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.760]   But I'm open to the idea that something that works for you and gets you to a healthier
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.520]   weight and a sustainability, like that is good.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.520]   That's good for me.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.360]   You know, provided it doesn't introduce other issues, you know.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.440]   Yeah, something one can do consistently.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.960]   That's something I picked up from you over the years, you know, what can you do consistently?
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.720]   And for me, that also meant what, when and how can I eat?
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.280]   What can I eat consistently that will also allow me to be alert after lunch so I can
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.360]   actually get some work done or eat.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.160]   I like to train fasted in the morning, but I don't do any long-term fasting.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.480]   It just so happens that I'm fine doing water and caffeine in the morning and training in
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.000]   the morning and then I eat my first meal afterwards.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.720]   But I get carbohydrates at night.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.320]   So my glycogen is restored.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.280]   I think carbohydrates are wonderful.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.000]   I just don't eat them in excess.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.160]   So to me, it's, I feel like when, what you describe as a very rational, literally balanced
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.600]   approach and obviously there will be variations for people who are dealing with obesity or
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.200]   diabetes or, you know, I've got friends that are on the pure carnivore thing.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.040]   I have friends that are vegan and it's always impressive to me when somebody can stick to
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.440]   anything consistently, except when they're sticking to just poor behavior.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.040]   So there's nothing impressive about that.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.160]   Well, I think that that's very helpful because I think there's a, for the typical listener
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.320]   of this podcast, you know, the online content that people see, the battles are very confusing.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.000]   They're distracting because people really think, oh, there's a right way and a wrong
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   way.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.640]   And it's, it sounds like the way that one can eat consistently over time that's healthy.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.560]   Certainly fewer processed and sugary foods.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.120]   I think almost everybody agrees there.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.120]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.120]   Almost everyone agrees on that.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.840]   So I think it is a, it's, it's a, it's calorie manipulation through some other method, right?
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.280]   So even, even intermittent fasting, like, you know, like you said, like I, that could
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.720]   be it's, it's for people that are grazers, like if you are a grazer and your real problem
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.600]   is portion control over the course of the day, but you can respond to a rule that says,
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.720]   no, you're eating between here and here that you can obey that rule.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.640]   Well, you're not going to be able to graze during the times that you might be doing additional
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   damage.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.480]   Sure, there's, there's, there's other hormonal benefits that people will talk about from
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.960]   that approach, but from a longevity standpoint and habit forming standpoint, if it's fixing
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.320]   the habit that you're breaking too often by eating throughout, whenever you feel like
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.440]   you walk by food, it's good, you know, and it works.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.200]   And again, it's, it's, it's, you know, people can, will tell you, you can probably eat whatever
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.360]   you want to eat as long as you're eating within those, that window, but I think the more responsible
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.840]   people who are practitioners of that will say, no, you still want to avoid processed
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.720]   sugar and things like that.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.760]   So, and that's just a mechanism of eating, not really a diet.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   Right.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.360]   But like, it's, it's, I think that people, I hate this.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.000]   I hate to be as like, as, as basic as, as it sounds with that, but it's for the exact
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.480]   reason that if it's that 23 hour a day phenomenon that it's like, you know, you said you're
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.480]   impressed.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   It is impressive.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.440]   You know, it's so hard to control all of our behaviors and food being one of the hardest
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.680]   thing, one of the biggest temptations for people, you got to learn how to control that
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.120]   for so long and then do it day after day after day.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:46.160]   Whatever that mechanism is that works for you is, is impressive and I'm a, I'm a believer
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   in it.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.520]   You know, I think that's the, that's, that's how I feel.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.400]   I just feel like people need to be able to be given some reins to be able to, to find
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   what works for them.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.360]   Well, I love to eat and one of the beauties of weight training is I feel like I can eat
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.960]   plenty for my age and I'm not as lean as you are, but I'm, I'm happy with where I'm at.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.520]   I could always do better, you know, with each year actually I've been getting better probably
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   because I'm eating cleaner probably because I also have someone to cook for me now and,
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.740]   and we like, and we like, I have that too.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.240]   We like healthy food and so we're, I'm very fortunate.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.080]   I don't think we have any packaged food in our home.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.280]   We even started making sauerkraut at home.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   I don't make it.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   She makes it.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.920]   You know, she, she turned me on to a tip that I actually shared with the whole channel,
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:37.520]   which was like, you can, you can go to, we have a Stu Leonard's around our, our big grocery
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.640]   store chain around us and they have a catering department and you know, they're often used
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   for catering big parties and you know, big tubs of, of, of grilled chicken, but like
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.860]   really good grilled chicken again, not the boiled chicken, but you know, big tubs of
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.520]   sweet potatoes and we'll, you know, we'll get a bunch of those and she'll go over and
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.000]   she'll get them, then she'll sort of arrange, you know, them on plates and put the plates
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.240]   in and like, I'm okay with repetitive eating.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.600]   I think more people are probably okay with repetitive eating than they think.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.800]   I think that when you actually break down how many different breakfast variety, like
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   variations do you have?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   Three, two?
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   Two or three maximum.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.960]   So like, I think when people do, there's more variety for dinner probably, but like you
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.280]   even there, you probably eat five different types of dinners, you know, over the course
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.440]   of, you know, a week or a month.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.440]   Well, you know, if you have that ability to identify the things that you like, and again,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.800]   no plan is going to work if you're eating stuff you don't like.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.280]   It's not going to work forever.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   Nothing will.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.600]   You have to really enjoy what you're eating.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.920]   As long as these, these variations of this meal are something that you really enjoy and
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.960]   there are limited versions of them, their reproducibility of that is simple.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.600]   You know, it will take some time, but if you're fortunate enough in our case to have somebody
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.400]   who can prepare it for you, now that's even part out of the equation, you know, and it's,
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.280]   it's like, it just makes it very simple.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   But I do think when you tally up all the costs of medical care that are, that are, that are
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:08.360]   spiked by having poor nutrition and you then offset that by what it might cost you to invest
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.720]   in a faster strategy like this catering trick or whatever it might be, you'd be best off
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.480]   figuring out a way to maybe reallocate some of your money to preparing this because you
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.000]   know how, how important it is to your longterm health and longevity.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.520]   If you can figure out your nutrition issues, if everyone listening to this podcast can
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.240]   figure out their nutrition issues, this whole world will be different.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.060]   That is like one of the largest sources of disease and, and pain and discomfort because
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.600]   people really struggle with nutrition.
