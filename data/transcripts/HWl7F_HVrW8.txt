[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Casey in Michigan writes in with a very perceptive question, "Pastor John, I have
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.160]   battled depression for about two years. I have this view of myself as a vile,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.600]   horrible, disgusting creature whose good works are filthy rags. When I sin, I tell
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.320]   myself, 'Of course I sinned. I'm a vile sinner. I don't know how to do anything
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.200]   else but sin. This is all I will ever do.' These views don't come out of nowhere. In
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.920]   fact, I always thought they were biblical views of mankind and that I was simply
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.240]   being humble, but reading the Word more and more, I see the Christians are
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.840]   supposed to have victory in Christ and they are beloved children of God." Yes,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.320]   amen. "But I don't know how to view my sin in any other way than becoming
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.520]   completely depressed. So my question is, how do I balance being humble yet not
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.680]   completely disgusted with myself and knowing I have value in the eyes of the
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.080]   Lord yet not becoming prideful?" Casey's question is so well crafted there at the
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:14.280]   end that I can't help thinking she knows the answer. She really, that was really
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.200]   well said, and that's hopeful to me. That's hopeful to me. I mean, she is, I'm
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.640]   not making light at all, and I take her at her word that she feels paralyzed
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.880]   by a sense of self-condemnation. So let me see what I can say, and I really do
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.960]   believe that the Lord has the answer here and applies the answer. My words may
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.200]   be a means, but God is the one who lifts us out of these kinds of darkness.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.640]   Tim Keller, I think, is the one who has made famous the gospel formulation. "You
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.880]   are more sinful than you ever thought you were." I'm gonna say that even to Casey,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.120]   who's, you know, she stated her sense of self-disgust pretty strongly, but I would
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.240]   say Casey hasn't gotten to the bottom. None of us has. So the first thing he
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.160]   says is, "You are more sinful than you ever thought you were, and you are more
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.280]   loved than you ever dreamed you could be." And that's true for Casey, too. So
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.800]   the beauty of that statement is that it doesn't become unrealistic at either end,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.280]   not the sin end or the grace end, and surely for Casey, believing this double
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   gospel formulation—more sinful than we could know, more loved than we could
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.040]   dream—surely this gospel formulation is the key to both humility without despair,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.120]   because that's what she said there at the end, "How do you know your sin
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:01.320]   without despair?" and at the other end, a feeling valued without feeling
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:10.680]   proud. So Casey, your sinfulness, which is worse than you think, is paid for at
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:20.480]   infinite cost, and God's valuing you is a free gift of grace that you don't
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.720]   deserve, but he delights to give. That's why he gives. He wants to value you. And
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.160]   so go ahead and let yourself see the fullness of the sinfulness of your sin,
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   but with every glimpse remind yourself of the infinite cost that was paid so
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.760]   that you don't dishonor the beauties of the Lord's sacrifice by holding on to
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.600]   the guilt that he paid to remove. And every time there's the slightest sense,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.080]   "He loves me. He values me. He's making me his daughter. He's taking me into his
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.800]   family," don't let that produce a big hit. It won't, because you don't deserve any of
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:18.280]   that. It is a free, blood-bought gift of grace overflowing from the heart of God.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.440]   You didn't earn it. You didn't constrain it, but he loves to give it. Now that's
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.360]   the basic gospel answer to someone struggling like Casey, I believe. But let
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.640]   me say a little more, because I'm sensing as I hear the question that there are a
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.880]   few things that need clarification that just might be liberating for Casey. I got
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.520]   two or three. First, let's clarify this text about filthy rags. I have heard that
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.640]   text quoted since the time I was a kid. It comes from the King James Version of
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   Isaiah 64, 6, and every time I've heard it used, it's used to describe Christian
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.120]   obedience. That is emphatically not what the text means, and it's wrong to
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.520]   describe Christian obedience that way. Here's the context. Let's read
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.440]   verses 5 and 6. I just want to liberate Casey from the weight of even
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.240]   thinking about her efforts at true Christian obedience being filthy rags.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.160]   They're not. Verse 5, "You meet him who joyfully works righteousness." So the very
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.520]   first thing in this context is God loves and honors and sees real righteousness
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.880]   in his people. We'll come back in a minute to whether it's perfect or not.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.640]   It's not perfect. "Those who remember you in your ways, behold, you were angry and
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.160]   we sinned. In our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved? We have
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.400]   all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:12.560]   polluted garment, like filthy rags." Now, those righteous deeds are not righteous.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.840]   They're not righteous. He's already talked about how he feels about
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.720]   righteousness. These righteous deeds are the kind Paul was talking about in
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.600]   Philippians 3, 5, where he says, "As to the law, I was a Pharisee. As to zeal, I was a
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   persecutor of the church. As to righteousness under the law, I was
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.000]   blameless." So there's righteousness, and it's blameless, and what does he say
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.600]   about it? He says it's filthy. It's dung. But those were not real righteousness.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:51.480]   That was pure, self-reliant legalism. That righteousness is dung. That
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.060]   righteousness is filthy rags. That's not the righteousness that Paul was talking
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.680]   about in chapter 1 of Philippians when he prayed, "Oh God, grant that they would
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.320]   be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.840]   Christ to the glory and praise of God." Christian obedience in the power of the
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.180]   Holy Spirit is not dung. It's not filthy rags. It's the answer to prayer. It's the
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.960]   work of Christ. It's the work of the Holy Spirit. It's wrong to describe the
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.720]   beautiful work of the Holy Spirit as filthy rags. The fruit of the Holy Spirit—
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.840]   love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, meekness, faithfulness, self-control—
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:36.880]   are not filthy rags. Now, second clarification. Casey might be helped in
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:43.000]   being reminded that while every good deed that we ever do is imperfect—
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.360]   that's what's tripping her up here, I think. She knows that and feels that, and
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.600]   I do too. Our motives, John Piper's motives, in my best moments are never
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.760]   completely free from indwelling sin and some kind of selfishness or pride is
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:05.720]   creeping in there, and that sinfulness, I must remind Casey, is covered
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:12.440]   by the blood of Christ, which is why Christ can delight in the good deed,
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:19.800]   because he covers the aspects of it that are not good. And Casey might have the
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.520]   unconscious sense—I think a lot of people do—the unconscious sense that
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:31.160]   Christ died for her bad deeds, but the good deeds are so imperfect that they
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.200]   leave her defiled and hopeless. This notion that, "Well, if I really sin, he
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.760]   might cover that, but my good deeds, those are supposed to be really good, and
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.160]   they're not really good, and so nothing is covering those, and I just want to
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:52.040]   cry out from the housetops that Christ died for my good deeds. He died for my
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   good deeds so that they could be acceptable, so that all the contamination
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.280]   in them could be covered. And if you need a text for that, consider this.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:09.200]   1 John 1:7, "If we walk in the light as he is in the light"—now that'd be good
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.440]   deeds—"if we walk in the light as he is in the light"—doing good things—"we have
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.800]   fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin."
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.960]   Well, now, wait a minute. You just said you were walking in the light. What's
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.720]   this "cleansing you from all sin" stuff? Well, he means none of our walking in the
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:33.920]   light is sinlessness. The next verse says, "If we say we have no sin"—and I would add
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.880]   while we're walking in the light—"we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.560]   us. But if we confess our sins"—which is part of what it means to walk in the
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.240]   light—"he is faithful and just to forgive our sins." So I just want to make
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:54.920]   crystal clear, the blood of Jesus is given to cover our bad deeds and cover
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.640]   our good deeds so that it is possible for the living Christ in infinite
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.560]   holiness to delight in the fruit of the Holy Spirit in our life, even though
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   Casey and I see every day that it's not what it ought to be. And here's the last
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   thing that she might need to hear, because I've talked to people
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:21.680]   recently about this. God's disapproval of our imperfections, which Casey feels in a
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:28.080]   paralyzing way—God's disapproval of our imperfections, which are real and daily,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.680]   is never a contempt for us. His disapproval of things in us is never
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.080]   contempt. So Hebrews 12 speaks of discipline, right? He's disciplining us,
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.680]   even bringing about suffering in our lives, because He disapproves of
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.520]   something in our hearts or in our behavior. He disapproves of it. And what
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.360]   are the words used to describe that? Verse 6, "For the Lord disciplines the
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:11:00.240]   one whom He loves and chastises every son He receives." And Proverbs that's being
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.000]   quoted here is even stronger. It's more paradoxical. The Lord reproves Him whom
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.320]   He loves as a father the son in whom He delights. Now Casey needs to get a handle
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.440]   on that. She knows the Father is reproving her. She knows He disapproves
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.600]   of her sin and the good deeds that are contaminated, but she's dropping
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.920]   this verse halfway through because it says He's doing that to people in
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:37.360]   whom He delights. Now most people did not grow up in homes where this was modeled.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.200]   That is, a dad or mom with strong disapproval of things in the children,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.160]   attitudes in the children, or behaviors, and a strong sense of being dad's delight,
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   mom's delight. Those things feel separate to most of us, and so we have to
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:03.560]   re-school ourselves with texts like this for God's children, God's children, even
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   while He is spanking them, even while there is a frown of disapproval on a
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:15.240]   behavior or an attitude. He never holds them in contempt. He never ceases to love
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   them. He never ceases even to delight in them as His children. So Casey, let's you
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.360]   and me, and everybody else because we're not by ourselves, let's dwell on the
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.700]   wonders of grace. Let every sense of unworthiness, which come daily, hourly
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:40.360]   maybe, let every sense of unworthiness send you higher into orbit of praise for
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:47.640]   the infiniteness of the price paid for you. It is your Father's good pleasure to
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.440]   give you the kingdom. Brilliant. That is counsel we can all take every day of the
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.800]   Christian life. Thank you, Pastor John. Well, for everything you need to know
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.280]   about this podcast and to send Pastor John a question, a carefully crafted
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.720]   question like this one from Casey, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.040]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
