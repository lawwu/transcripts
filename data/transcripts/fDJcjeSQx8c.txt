[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   It's a simple thing, but in the morning I say, okay, what's the thing I want to accomplish today?
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.680]   What's going to be the highlight of my day today?
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.760]   Write it down and it's so helpful for making sure you have an awesome day and you get done the one thing that's most important.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:20.040]   Arguably, one of my favorite filters for whether something should be on the docket for today is applying the hell yes or no filter.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.500]   And back in episode 109, I talked to Derek Sivers who wrote a book called Hell Yeah or No.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.280]   And we had this amazing conversation.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.360]   It's one of the more interesting episodes because I didn't have an agenda going into the episode.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.300]   We didn't have a specific topic we wanted to focus on.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.600]   So often I'm like, ooh, I want to learn about gut health or I want to learn how to rethink elite status.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.220]   In this one, I was just like, Derek Sivers is such a great modern philosopher.
