[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   When it comes to sales, how do you know whether closing a tough customer is worth the effort?
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.040]   Here's a framework for how to think about that. This is a two-by-two quadrant. On one axis,
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.720]   we have the deal size or ACV, annual contract value. The deal can be small or large. And on
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   the other axis, we have deal velocity, which can be fast or slow. It's fine to be in the top left
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.760]   corner where you're doing lots of sales really fast of a small dollar amount. Or you can be in
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.320]   the bottom right corner where you're doing enterprise deals, which are large ACV deals,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.800]   but they take longer to close. Obviously, if you can be in the top right where you're doing big
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.000]   deals fast, that's an amazing place to be. But the one quadrant that doesn't work at all is when
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.120]   you're doing small deals slowly. If you're in that quadrant, you don't really have a business model.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.440]   You need to go back to the drawing board and work on either your product market fit or figuring out
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.200]   your go-to-market model. If you're going to do small deals, you need to stack them up fast.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.400]   In sales, it's all about getting to an efficient,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.080]   repeatable motion. You got to make sure that the juice is worth the squeeze.
