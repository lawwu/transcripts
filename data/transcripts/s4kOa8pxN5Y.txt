[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   But in order for you to understand what I say about fluoride
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.820]   and to make the best decision about fluoride,
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.880]   both in drinking water and toothpaste, et cetera, for you,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.680]   you have to understand the remineralization process
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.640]   just a little bit, just a little bit.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.720]   So a little bit of chemistry here,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.540]   a little bit of structural biology, and this'll be fun.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.100]   I promise, even if you know no biology,
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.240]   no structural biology, no chemistry,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.840]   you're going to like this part, and it's very simple.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.480]   Those minerals that form the crystals within the enamel
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.320]   and some of the deeper layers of your tooth,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.360]   or teeth, rather,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.360]   those crystals form through a specific type of bond,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.560]   and those bonds are very strong.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.880]   Think of them like Lego chains,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.360]   but these are not just conventional Lego chains.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.940]   These are Lego chains that when they stick,
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.760]   when two pieces come together,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.560]   things are tough to pull apart.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.160]   They're not indestructible, but they're tough to pull apart.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.920]   And they're also special because unlike a string of Legos,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160]   like a single string of Legos,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.840]   these bonds that form during remineralization of the teeth
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.560]   are interdigitated with one another,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.840]   or rather, are at angles with one another
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.280]   that make those bonds especially strong.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.160]   Any architect or somebody that understands
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.400]   structural biology will understand
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.880]   that bonds can be weak or strong
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.640]   depending on whether or not they're linear,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.680]   whether or not they're crossed,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.120]   whether or not they're in lattices.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.360]   There's a whole bunch of interesting angled forces stuff
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760]   that the architects will understand,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.040]   and the construction workers will understand
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.240]   at a very intuitive and in concrete level,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420]   no pun intended, and on and on.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.920]   But just think about it.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.540]   A bond is only as strong as the number of different points
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.140]   at which it can resist shearing and pressure.
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.240]   So the way that these remineralization bonds form
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.800]   is through the addition of specific minerals
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.720]   at specific angles and the naturally occurring mineral
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.780]   that's responsible for the majority of these bonds
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.640]   in the enamel and teeth is called hydroxyapatite.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.600]   What a great name if you're talking about oral health,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.920]   right, 'cause we use the mouth for a lot of things.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.040]   You can think of the small list or long list of those things.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   There are many of them, you know, depending on who you are
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.240]   and what you like to do with your mouth.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.680]   But the point being that we do indeed eat with our mouth.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   Appetite is part of eating.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.920]   So you just remember hydroxyapatite bonds,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.200]   and they are very strong, but they're not indestructible.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.600]   Acid can actually break those bonds.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.180]   Okay, that's the demineralization process.
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.700]   Now, fluoride is a substance that is not a vitamin.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.880]   It's not a mineral.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.620]   It is not an essential nutrient,
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.140]   but that in the last century, it was discovered,
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.040]   can actually replace some of the hydroxyapatite bonds
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.620]   in teeth and actually make those bonds hyper strong,
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.900]   super physiologically strong.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900]   Now, we'll talk about the safety considerations
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.000]   with fluoride in a little bit,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.060]   because there are some safety considerations,
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.200]   but it was decided en masse in the United States and Europe
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.140]   that the addition of fluoride to the drinking water
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.420]   and to many toothpastes or tooth powders would be useful
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.760]   because it creates these super physiologically strong bonds
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.980]   within the minerals of the teeth.
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.620]   And indeed it does, it does.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.500]   Fluoride gets between those Lego pieces
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.680]   and makes them extra, extra strong.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.780]   And this is why fluoride is added to the drinking water.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.660]   But, and this is very important to emphasize,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.020]   but nowadays there's a really polarized debate
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.620]   about fluoride,
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.540]   because some people out there believe that fluoride
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.060]   can disrupt thyroid health,
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.300]   might even be disruptive for brain health.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.420]   Certainly if fluoride levels are too high
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.460]   in drinking water or any substance,
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.820]   it can be very dangerous.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.640]   It can be a poison,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.580]   but of course the dose makes the poison, right?
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.120]   Fluoride itself may not be poisonous at very low levels,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.340]   but there are really two camps now that have formed.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.760]   And I'll just illustrate those two camps
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.620]   by virtue of what's happening right now.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.640]   Right now in the state of California,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.900]   there is a major lawsuit against the government
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.680]   because people want fluoride removed from the drinking water
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.720]   because of the long list of bad things that excessive,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.820]   I wanna highlight excessive fluoride can do
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.080]   for bodily and brain health,
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.280]   especially in kids, but also in adults.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.240]   At the very same time, meaning right now,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.760]   there is also a major lawsuit,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.360]   this one in Buffalo, New York,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.600]   from mostly parents who are suing the city of Buffalo,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.040]   saying that there was not enough,
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.320]   maybe even zero fluoride in the drinking water
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.220]   for some period of time.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.740]   And as a consequence, their children's teeth
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.240]   or oral health or both is depleted
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.200]   and they are suing for damages.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.700]   Okay, so this is a really polarized camp.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.080]   Now I did a full episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.200]   all about water.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.180]   And I talked about fluoride levels,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.920]   which levels are thought by the CDC to be safe,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.100]   which levels are not thought to be safe.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.680]   I talked about some of the theories
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.100]   as to how fluoride might disrupt function of the thyroid
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.840]   and some considerations there.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.600]   Please check out the timestamp in that episode.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.680]   I linked to that timestamp in the caption for this episode.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.360]   But the important point here is that
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.040]   if you are at all concerned about fluoride
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.240]   in the drinking water,
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.140]   the simple answer is to just filter the water
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.100]   that comes out of the tap.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.240]   If you're concerned about fluoride,
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.620]   then I suppose you'd probably wanna avoid toothpaste
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.460]   that have fluoride.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.560]   Indeed, there are some.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.120]   I will provide links to some of those
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.080]   in the show note captions for this episode.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.680]   There are a variety of these zero fluoride toothpaste
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.480]   that have started to accumulate.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.640]   But keep in mind that when fluoride is introduced
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.600]   into the bonds of the minerals of the teeth,
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.880]   they do make the teeth really, really strong.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.200]   But, and all the dentists I spoke to emphasize this point,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.720]   the bonds that form are not the natural bonds.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.360]   Now, the fact that they're not the natural bonds
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.720]   doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't good for us
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.220]   or that they're bad for us.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.680]   But the bonds that form when viewed
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.120]   under what's called electron microscopy look different.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.240]   They look wavy.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.620]   They're not smooth bonds.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.620]   And they do increase the resistance to different forces,
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.780]   including cavities or acid that would create cavities
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.960]   to be specific.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.200]   They make the teeth stronger structurally,
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.460]   so resistance to chipping, et cetera.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.720]   But there is a growing concern about excessive fluoride,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.360]   which by the way, if you drink a lot of tap water,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.920]   you're going to be exposed to more fluoride
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.200]   than if you drink less tap water.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.600]   That's just kind of stands to reason,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.360]   but people don't really talk about this, right?
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.080]   When you talk about X amount of fluoride
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.040]   by concentration in a given liter of water
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.840]   or gallon of water, you also have to ask,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.760]   well, how much tap water are you drinking every day?
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.240]   Okay, you have to ask that question, right?
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.000]   It's not simply the concentration,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.800]   it's how much you're ingesting overall.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.920]   And that's something that's much harder to control for.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.520]   Again, in the water episode, I talked about ways
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   to eliminate or reduce fluoride in the drinking water
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.000]   if that's a concern of yours.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.520]   But if you want to know why there's fluoride
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.200]   in drinking water, it's because governments figured out,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.320]   hey, well, if we want to reduce tooth decay,
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.100]   what's the simplest low cost method to do that?
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.720]   Well, it's to put fluoride in the drinking water.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.000]   And you now also now know why there's fluoride
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.360]   in a lot of toothpaste.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.440]   But given the concerns about thyroid health,
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.800]   potential concerns about brain health,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.640]   now you also know why many people,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.600]   including some dentists that I spoke to,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.080]   are not big fans of fluoride,
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.960]   both for children and for adults.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.400]   So you just have to make a decision for you.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.800]   I'm not here to tell you what to do.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.420]   You just have to decide, are you pro neutral
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.220]   or against fluoride in your drinking water?
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.840]   And if so, are you going to filter?
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.280]   Are you going to completely avoid drinking any water,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.980]   maybe even cooking with any water from the tap
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.820]   and on and on?
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.700]   But now you know why fluoride is in drinking water
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.000]   and fluoride is in toothpaste.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.320]   If you're somebody who's concerned about fluoride
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.540]   in either or both of those sources,
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.960]   well, then what you really want to think about
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.200]   and what most of us probably should be thinking about anyway
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.240]   is trying to increase the remineralization state
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.160]   of our teeth and mouth in ways
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.460]   that don't create the opportunity
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.920]   for any other health hazard.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.480]   And I will say this as well,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.640]   which is that there's some data, not a lot,
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.240]   but some data that fluoride might not be so great
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.580]   for our oral microbiome.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.640]   And as we'll soon learn,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.600]   the oral microbiome is critical
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.840]   for our oral and overall health.

[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.840]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.420]   (upbeat music)
