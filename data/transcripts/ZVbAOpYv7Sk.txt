[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   If by Rudyard Kipling
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.120]   If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.960]   If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you but make allowance for their doubting too
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.040]   If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about don't deal in lies
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.000]   Or being hated don't give way to hating and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.040]   If you can dream and not make dreams your master If you can think and not make thoughts your aim
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.080]   If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.400]   If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.840]   Or watch the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn out tools
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.400]   If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.440]   And lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.400]   If you can force your heart to nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they're gone
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.480]   And so hold on when there's nothing in you except the will which says to them hold on
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.000]   If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with kings nor lose the common touch
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.440]   If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you if all men count with you but none too much
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   If you can fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.680]   Yours is the earth and everything that's in it and which is more you'll be a man my son
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.840]   You
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.840]   You
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   You
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   You
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   You
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   You
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   You
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
