[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.460]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.600]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.960]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.760]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.040]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.120]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.280]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.560]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.160]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.080]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.080]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.840]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.440]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.400]   Well, listeners, welcome to this episode
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.720]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.640]   I am excited to introduce some of my friends to you today,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.520]   and we are going to talk
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.160]   kind of like a round table discussion,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.800]   or you can close your eyes
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.880]   and pretend like we are all friends
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.240]   sitting around the fire with hot cocoa or hot tea.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.280]   We are gonna talk about
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.840]   our homeschooling journeys together.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.800]   And I have invited some friends
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.480]   who are at different spots on the homeschool journey
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.280]   so that all of our experiences can be represented.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.440]   And I suspect that you will find a kindred spirit
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.280]   to walk along your journey with you.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.400]   So you just enjoy the conversation
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.320]   that you can eavesdrop on with my friends.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.200]   I have with me today,
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.320]   D'Lise, D'Lise say hello to all our friends.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.600]   - Hey, everybody.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.080]   - D'Lise has an adorable little guy.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.200]   Tell us about Leo.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.080]   - So Leo is three years old.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.160]   He is very precocious.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.600]   He's a curious, fun little boy
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.480]   who has a lot of questions
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.760]   and a lot of energy like little boys at his age do.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.240]   He is so great.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.360]   And we are just very thankful to have him.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.160]   - Yes, and D'Lise, this is really cool.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.680]   I wanted you to have the perspective of a mom
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.960]   who was herself homeschooled,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.000]   who is looking toward the homeschool journey
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.120]   with her own son.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.640]   So D'Lise, thank you so much for being with us today.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.880]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.120]   - Charity Brown is also here.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.800]   Charity, say hello and tell us about
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.680]   your family of homeschoolers.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.560]   - So hello to everyone from the sunny South.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.880]   I have one daughter who is in Cincinnati, Ohio finishing,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.800]   well, she's midway through her sophomore year
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.720]   in Bible college there and enjoying the cold and the snow.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.320]   I also have a senior who is wrapping up
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.480]   his first semester of his senior year
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.640]   and is looking forward to joining his sister
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.000]   in Cincinnati next fall.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.360]   So I am right at the very end
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.640]   of my active homeschool journey.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.080]   - That is so cool.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   And so I have two daughters who have graduated
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.280]   through the challenge four program,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.720]   have graduated college or both married.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   And I have two grandchildren and one on the way,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.800]   one who is about six months younger than D'Lise's Leo
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.560]   and then a little, a granddaughter
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.800]   who just turned eight months.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.920]   And so we are gonna talk about the homeschool journey
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.600]   and what it looks like through the different lenses
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.160]   at different parts of the homeschool journey.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.600]   And we are glad that you're here with us.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.120]   I'd like to ask both of you,
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.240]   D'Lise I'll get you to answer first.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   Your homeschool journey in an official way
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.640]   maybe hasn't started yet.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.880]   A lot of times people, new homeschoolers say,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   well, we started homeschooling
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.760]   when our daughter was in the second grade
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.600]   and we came to homeschooling late
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.160]   and they were almost in middle school.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.000]   Or somebody will say we've homeschooled
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.400]   from the very beginning, so from kindergarten.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.280]   And then I have some wise friends who have said,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.440]   oh, we started homeschooling from the beginning at birth
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.640]   because we're teaching our children the whole time.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   So I wanna ask you as a newer mom,
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.480]   what's the best outcome of homeschooling so far?
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.800]   So as you are walking through life
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.760]   with your curious questioner,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.520]   what's the best part of it for you so far?
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.040]   - Yeah, well, I would definitely say
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.600]   I fall into the camp of those who believe
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.160]   that you homeschool from the moment
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.560]   that you receive your child.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.240]   So I've always thought of myself as teaching him
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.000]   because that's what we do as parents.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And I think what's been such a reassuring part of it
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.240]   teaching him so far is his healthy mind.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.080]   I had an early childhood background
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.440]   before I became a parent
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.840]   and had a lot of neurological research that I'd done
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.680]   and things like that.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.280]   And so I believed a lot of things about the brain
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.080]   but I hadn't got to test it every day on a child.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.640]   It was just, you go in the classroom
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.200]   and you test it over a period of years,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.320]   but you really don't have as much,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.200]   I hate to use this word,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.760]   but control over those environments.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.560]   - Sure, sure.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.320]   And so with Leo, one of the things we emphasized
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.000]   really early on was just reading to him,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.040]   long chapter books, all kinds of interesting things,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.280]   things that I wanted to hear,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.800]   especially when I was early in that postpartum time.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.720]   And that has helped him to develop an extensive vocabulary,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.600]   a really genuine curiosity and imagination.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.520]   And it's just been fun to see the fruit of those things
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.240]   that are so basic, but really effective for him.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.560]   We limited screen time,
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.080]   which I know is a very controversial thing these days,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.280]   but I believe that it's really helped his brain
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   to develop well.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.520]   And so it's been fun to see
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.480]   what just putting your little boy outside can do
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.960]   for them while they're growing.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.040]   - Yes, I agree with you so very much.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.800]   Is it working out like you thought it would?
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.400]   - Honestly, it's working out a little better
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.120]   than I thought it would.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.200]   I didn't, I mean, I know he's not perfect,
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.880]   he's a child and that's fine,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.560]   but I think I underestimated
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.200]   the power of-- - What he could do.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.800]   - Books and hanging out with sweet people
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.480]   and serving and playing
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.120]   and just those really simple things
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.560]   I think are more effective than we give them credit.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.400]   - Oh, Delise, that's so encouraging.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.240]   Mamas out there, you are doing enough.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.320]   When you are reading every day with your little person
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.440]   and you are going outside and exploring
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.240]   and answering a bajillion questions
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.560]   and asking a few of your own
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.280]   and encouraging their imaginations
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   and giving them opportunities
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.160]   to serve their family and their neighbors,
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.360]   you are doing a great thing
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.160]   and you are building healthy brains and healthy souls.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.560]   Thank you, Delise, that's really good.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.680]   Charity, I wanna ask you, you have a longer runway.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.240]   I mean, you had a longer,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.320]   you've got a longer flight to look back on.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.320]   So what's the best outcome of homeschooling so far?
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.840]   - I was thinking about this question
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.040]   as Delise was talking.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.520]   I feel like the reading aloud with the kids
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.440]   has been a huge part of what the best outcome has been.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.600]   So our best outcome has definitely been the relationship
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.800]   that our children have with each other
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.520]   and all of the shared memories.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.280]   And so much of that is centered around
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.120]   the books we read together.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.560]   And when they get together, which we just did,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.160]   our daughter was home for Thanksgiving
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.400]   and for a whole week, they got to be together,
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.120]   which is their favorite place to be.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.520]   And they are big pals and all the shared jokes,
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.720]   the inside jokes that they share
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.360]   that come from a whole educational journey spent together,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.160]   not separated off into other groups and other classes
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.520]   for all their waking hours.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.360]   - Yes, yes.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.800]   - And they just shared everything.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.360]   And so if we did Dickens, they both did Dickens.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.840]   And if we did Austin, they both did Austin.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.640]   Yes, I made my son read Austin.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.240]   - That's good for you, girlfriend.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.680]   - I know, so they have all the shared,
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.400]   oh, he's a Willoughby.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.120]   They have all that shared material.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.240]   And I would say it has done wonderful things
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.440]   to build their relationship together.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.360]   And so kudos to you, Delise,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.480]   for reading with your little guy,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.720]   because that is totally a huge part
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.400]   of building those relationships.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.360]   - Oh, I love that, Charity,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   that the best thing or the best outcome so far
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.720]   for your family has been the relationships,
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.800]   the memories, the experiences, the inside jokes,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.880]   the characterizations.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.640]   There are times, our family read a lot
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.040]   and continues to read a lot.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.120]   When our grown kids and their spouses
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.400]   were home last Christmas,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.920]   we read "A Christmas Carol" aloud again.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.520]   And I think that their husbands
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.760]   had never done that really with their families,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.040]   but we built some great memories.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.520]   I love the whole idea that they are sharing
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.440]   what they're learning.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.120]   They're sharing their lives.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.320]   They're sharing their childhoods.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.800]   That is something special.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.920]   You know, when we ask parents,
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.160]   what are your goals in homeschooling?
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.720]   A lot of times, many of us come to homeschooling
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.960]   with a lot of academic goals.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.520]   Even when we say, well, we want them
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.160]   to learn as much as they can
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.920]   about as much as they're interested in
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.600]   and all that kind of thing.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.080]   But I think the longer we homeschool,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.120]   the more we all see the value
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.520]   in building a family culture,
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.360]   a family culture of learning,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.120]   but a family culture of care also.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.000]   That's really good.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.560]   Thank you guys for bringing those things up.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.760]   I wanna ask a get real question here,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.880]   'cause we try on the everyday educator
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.400]   to not let it be all hearts and flowers
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.280]   and pretty pictures that we paint,
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.200]   'cause we all live in the real world.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.560]   And some days we get up
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.880]   and like Lee Bordens herself says,
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.040]   we're all just little centers running around.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.640]   And so I wanna ask you,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.360]   what is a hard aspect of homeschooling?
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.960]   And maybe this was something
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.400]   that you anticipated being difficult,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.280]   or maybe it was an unexpected difficulty
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.040]   that you encountered along the way.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.120]   Charity, what's a hard aspect of homeschooling?
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.440]   For me, the hardest aspect of homeschooling
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.400]   has been doing school in the same place
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.440]   where we relax and sleep and play.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:36.560]   And I know, and this is a controversial idea for sure,
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.360]   but I know lots of homeschoolers
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.400]   who the beautiful thing for them about homeschooling
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.680]   is getting to do school in their pajamas.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.360]   And I totally understand that.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.000]   But for us as a family,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.640]   we have found that it has helped us immensely
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.280]   to put in artificial boundaries
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.680]   to help the children know it's time for school.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.680]   Otherwise, it always fell apart for us.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.480]   And so for us it was,
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.520]   yes, we are fun and we do fun things
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.640]   and we love to go outside
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.240]   and all the fun parts of homeschooling.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.840]   But what kept our sanity
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.640]   was we started at the same time approximately every year,
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.400]   less that be hearts and flowers and not real.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.840]   I will say, in the interest of honesty,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.200]   we started at eight o'clock in the fall.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.400]   By the spring, we were starting around 10.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.720]   (both laughing)
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.000]   - There's the real, there's the real.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.760]   - But we still were starting at the same time
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.280]   in the general context.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.040]   And so we did school with clothes on, not pajamas.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.320]   And as they got older and were more mature
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.240]   and more responsible, that relaxed considerably.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.080]   But in the early years,
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.000]   we found it to be very helpful
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.880]   to keep lots of artificial boundaries
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   help their brains come into a learning away from drop,
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.240]   stepping away from free play
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.840]   into a more structured learning environment.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.760]   And so that has been the hardest thing
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.320]   to manage every year in my opinion.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.840]   - Mm-hmm, and you know, you are right.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.520]   It depends on the family.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.840]   So every listener you're going to need to gauge your family,
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.600]   maybe what your family culture is,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.200]   is the more free flowing school in your pajamas.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.920]   And as it happens and mingled around with life,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.800]   maybe that fits your family.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.120]   Maybe you as the lead learner in your home
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.080]   or some or all of your children
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.240]   really need more structure, a more routine.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.520]   I think you're wise Charity to recognize that for y'all,
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.360]   you needed those boundaries.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.680]   I had a friend that we homeschooled our kids together
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.560]   and she had 10 children.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.440]   And so for her, she also demanded that her kids get dressed
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.200]   but the getting 10 children dressed was such a nightmare
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.160]   that for several years, while everybody was kind of young,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.360]   she instituted this school uniform
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   and it was like t-shirts and jumpers for the girls,
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.760]   things that everybody could put on.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.040]   It was all the same.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.320]   We don't have to worry.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.960]   She has my shirt, he took my socks.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.200]   Nope, you're putting on the same thing.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.960]   You're putting this on when we do school.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.120]   So sometimes routines are really good.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.640]   So let me ask you this Delise,
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.640]   as a homeschool mom, as you continue along the journey
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.760]   that you and your husband have begun with Leo,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.040]   what is your biggest fear?
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.880]   - That is a great question.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.720]   And I have to say,
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.160]   I was in the same structured household as well.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.120]   And I appreciated it.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.240]   I needed to get- - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.000]   - To shake so I could learn.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.280]   You know, so I think sometimes people think,
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.480]   oh, that's gonna feel too militant for my child.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.200]   And it really just depends on what your family needs.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.840]   And speaking of, depending on what your family needs,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.880]   you know, hindsight is 20/20.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   And so I am concerned that I'm going to emphasize
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.720]   the wrong things.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.160]   And you mentioned at the beginning of this episode,
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.680]   you know, I've been in this homeschool space
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.600]   for a long time.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.040]   I was a child of the 90s.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.000]   I'm in my 30s.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.680]   I was homeschooled through high school and I'm one of four.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.160]   And so I've seen a lot of different homeschool outcomes,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.440]   a lot of stories.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.600]   And I have a lot of peers who have varying perspectives
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.640]   on their homeschooling journey, just to be honest.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.360]   And so- - Right, right.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.600]   - I'm a little concerned that my son might
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.040]   ultimately misunderstand and maybe even regret
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.160]   some of my reasons for homeschooling him
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.880]   because I do plan to homeschool him through high school.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.160]   And that's not something that I can control
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.760]   and I understand that. - Right, yes.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.040]   - But it is a concern and something that my mom
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.000]   has always said about helping us to understand
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.400]   her thought pattern is that instead of explaining
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.120]   why she thinks the way she does,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.120]   she always just exposed us to how she drew a conclusion.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.120]   And that way, even if we disagreed with her,
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   at least we knew she wasn't crazy.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.280]   - Yes, and I know your mom.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.400]   She's a dear, dear friend of mine.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.960]   Shelly is not crazy.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.400]   - She is not crazy.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.200]   And so I'm hopeful that that will be the same case
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.440]   with my son, that if I show him how I drew my conclusion,
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.080]   at least he'll understand that I loved him and I meant well.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.360]   But I do anticipate making a lot of mistakes
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.120]   along with having a lot of successes.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.760]   So we'll see if I emphasize the right things over time.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.920]   - It's so interesting.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.960]   I think, Delise, that everybody worries about that.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.280]   Like, will I leave out the one thing
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.200]   that my child really needed to learn?
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.520]   And here's what I will tell you, Delise,
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   'cause I'm looking back at the journey where you are now.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.200]   You will leave out something.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.560]   You will, all of us here,
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.320]   everybody within the sound of my voice,
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.920]   just go ahead and accept it.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.480]   You will leave out something.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   You will overemphasize something that was important to you
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.120]   that ends up not being important to your kid.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.960]   And you will underemphasize something
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.200]   that they would probably have benefited
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.840]   from having more of.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.000]   And we're all going to make those kinds of mistakes.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   But here is the absolute beauty of a classical education.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.800]   You will have equipped your child to recoup his losses.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.480]   He will know how to go about learning
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.960]   whatever you didn't teach enough of.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.520]   Or he will know how to go about learning
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.400]   what he develops an interest in
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.720]   after he leaves your tutelage.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.680]   The beauty of a classical education
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.640]   is that we equip them to stay learners.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.360]   And that is awesome.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.200]   That is awesome.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.880]   Charity, did you have any big fears as a homeschooling mom?
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.000]   Do you still have big fears?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.560]   - Do we all, don't we all have big fears, right?
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.120]   - Yes.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.000]   - When I was really young and just starting out,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.200]   my biggest fear was that I would not be enough
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.240]   to quote unquote cover the subjects.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.960]   At some point along the way,
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.000]   I realized that you can deep dive an entire lifetime
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.120]   in any one subject.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.240]   And so we never cover the subject.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.960]   And I feel like that for me was freeing
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.040]   to know that no, I can't 100% cover anything
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.600]   with my children.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   And instead of making that my goal,
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.760]   that we must thoroughly cover the subject,
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.880]   it was more of a, let's not,
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.400]   like I turned my fear into,
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.960]   okay, I don't wanna turn off their wonder for a subject
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.640]   by being too rigid.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.880]   'Cause I am prone to rigidity in structure
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.040]   as by my personality.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   And now as I watch my children and they're finishing,
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.960]   Alex is finishing his senior year,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.480]   Catherine is in college.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.720]   I want them to understand that the education they had at home
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.520]   was just the beginning of education.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.040]   It wasn't the end of education.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.520]   Mom didn't cover everything.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.920]   Mom wasn't supposed to cover everything
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.560]   that you've learned for a lifetime.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.760]   And so at this point,
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.200]   now that I'm less involved in the hands-on
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.600]   educating of my children,
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.360]   I think one of the things that we're giving them
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.560]   is they go downstairs and they see their dad
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.640]   is watching a video on quantum mechanics
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.160]   because it interests him.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.320]   - Yes.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.160]   - He's a nerd, you know, I love him.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.800]   Or they see me doing something else that I'm learning.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.200]   And just to be modeling that, we learn for life.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.160]   And to let go of that fear that somehow I'm gonna stunt them
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.120]   because I didn't cover it all.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.960]   You won't, you absolutely will not cover it all.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.240]   And that's a good thing.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.840]   And so-- - Yes.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.080]   - Yeah, so now my fear is I just don't wanna shut them down
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.360]   on a subject because I got too rigid.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.600]   - Yeah.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.200]   - So my fears have changed.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.520]   - Isn't that interesting?
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.000]   Your fears have changed just like a kaleidoscope changes
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.600]   by just you turn it and oh, there's something else.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.000]   There's another picture.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.200]   Oh, I didn't notice that.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.720]   Oh, there's a different color.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.920]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.400]   The things that I feared in the early days
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   are not what I feared as they headed toward graduation.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.800]   And we all grew, we all grew.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.520]   Guys, we've talked about and I mentioned
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.240]   just a few minutes ago that what we strive to do
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.680]   in classical education is give our children the,
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:07.840]   we give them the skills to learn anything.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:13.600]   And that is what a classical education seeks to do.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.400]   Teach our children how to learn anything
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.400]   that they're interested in or anything
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.440]   that they need to know for life.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   Whether or not a mentor appears.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.800]   What's classical education to you, Delise?
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.240]   - I love this question, especially because I work here
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.440]   at Classical Conversations.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.320]   - No one ever asks me what I think about it.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.160]   (laughing)
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.000]   And so I love pondering it from a personal perspective.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.040]   Right now, at the early stage,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.320]   I would say I have two perspectives of classical education
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.400]   or two goals for my son.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.320]   The first one would be to teach him
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.840]   how to think methodically through a topic
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.760]   and to progress and to realize that he is progressing
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.480]   from grammar through dialectic and then to rhetoric.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.320]   So that, I think sometimes when we're learning
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.120]   about something, we feel a little bit disoriented.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.960]   And I know that those different stages
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.760]   are often melded together.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.680]   - Uh-huh.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.920]   - Helping yourself to think in categories
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.600]   and say, "Hey, I need to define this.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.520]   "My problem is actually a definitions issue.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.640]   "Let's go back to grammar really quickly."
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.640]   I think just causes a person to learn more effectively.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.200]   And so I would love for him to be able to see the world
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.920]   through those eyes.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.640]   And then secondarily, I really want him
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.720]   to have a framework for the integration of subjects.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.560]   I think that's gonna be more important
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.000]   than it ever has been in the world that we have
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.560]   just because a lot of people don't understand
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.360]   how agriculture works together
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.720]   with something like history or geography.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.840]   And so for him to look at the world and say,
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.280]   "Hey, all of these different subjects
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.360]   "are not actually isolated.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.480]   "They are interacting with each other in real time,
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.440]   "affecting one another.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.880]   "And if I can understand math, I can understand history."
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   Those types of perspectives,
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.840]   I think are really gonna help him in life.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.360]   And I hope he gains that from a classical education.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.840]   - Oh, what a lucky little boy Leo is.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   That's beautiful.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.400]   That is beautiful, Delyse.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.320]   And I think that that will really help him.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.720]   Charity, what would you say?
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.760]   What's classical education to you?
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:40.080]   - Classical education is, in my mind, at this stage,
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.640]   it's a natural way.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.600]   It uses God-given natural ways we learn
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.920]   to move from wonder to exploring and thinking well,
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.520]   as Delyse was talking about,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.840]   thinking well and reasoning well
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.040]   about those things that we're wondering about,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.240]   to then expressing those thoughts well enough
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   to actually inspire wonder in others.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.940]   And I think it is not only from,
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:07.360]   not only does it incorporate the natural way we learn,
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.880]   but it also is a beautiful way to prepare our children
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.300]   to share the most important thing, the gospel,
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.680]   to teach them the wonder of Christ,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.880]   and then to think well and reason well
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.200]   on theology and logic and philosophy,
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.920]   and then to be able to spread that message to others.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.720]   I think that it is the perfect setup
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   to building strong communicators for Christ in the world.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.760]   - That's great.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.600]   That is great.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.800]   Building strong communicators for Christ in the world.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.680]   That is a wonderful goal for us as parents.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.880]   And NCC, we talk about classical Christian community
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.400]   and how important that is to you.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.760]   Charity, what is it that makes what you do at home
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.680]   with your family as you learn?
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.100]   What makes that a Christian education?
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.520]   - The Christian part is the thing
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.560]   that ties everything else together at our house.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.080]   Having come up through public school,
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.920]   I didn't have the privilege of being homeschooled.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.160]   Coming through public school,
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.500]   religious beliefs or creeds or practices
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.240]   were kept in a box, and they were outside of the classroom.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.460]   And I remember the first time I ever entered
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.760]   a Christian classroom in college,
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.460]   I went to a Christian college
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.960]   for the beginning of my education,
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.040]   and the professor opened the class with prayer.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.500]   And I remember thinking,
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.720]   even though I'm a Christian, this feels wrong.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.880]   It felt-
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.200]   - So different, so different for you.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.840]   - Yeah, it felt like someone had put a square peg
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.520]   into a round hole in my mind.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.280]   And it took a number of years for that
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.320]   to kind of detox out of my system.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.040]   And now, the ability to seek Christ
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.240]   in the different subjects,
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.800]   to showcase Christ in all the subjects that we learn,
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   to practice the two great commandments,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.120]   loving God and loving others
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.920]   in your own built-in safe place every day,
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.160]   is a beautiful thing.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.920]   And I think it's an opportunity that's second to none.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.960]   So yes, the integration of Christ
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.200]   as central to all the subjects
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.840]   has been the Christian part of the education for us.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.760]   - That's great.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.080]   What a great thing for you to be able to realize
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.100]   for yourself and then to promote to your children.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.320]   So it's really interesting,
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.400]   your children probably have never seen
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.760]   learning apart from the Lord.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.640]   - That is true.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.360]   My daughter is at a Christian college
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.280]   and it's such a privilege,
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.520]   such a privilege to view learning
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.120]   through the lens of scripture,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.880]   through the lens of truth.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.000]   And I know they recently,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.560]   my son recently had to go and take the SAT
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.020]   for college entrance and stuff.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.940]   And that was his first time to step into a public school
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.720]   and be around an education environment
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.560]   where God was not present.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.260]   And it was a very unusual experience for him.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:22.120]   So yeah, they've never experienced an education
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.600]   apart from Jesus in the room.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.880]   And I feel like that is a gift
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.520]   that we've been privileged to offer our children.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.400]   - It's beautiful.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.600]   I know that for so many of us,
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.540]   we did not, we're not as lucky as Delise.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.960]   We did not come from a homeschool environment
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.480]   where our parents could always put Jesus in the room
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.280]   and that Christ was always central
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.400]   and integrated into everything that we learned.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.080]   Our children are blessed
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.960]   with a different kind of education.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.720]   And I think it's gonna take a generation or so
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.900]   for us to realize what a blessing that was.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.220]   Delise, how do you make what you do at home
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.700]   with Leo Christian?
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.820]   - Hmm, that's a good question.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.100]   Well, you know, I am at the stage of parenting
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.200]   where, and maybe this never goes away
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.660]   and I just don't know it yet,
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.620]   where everything is a character conversation.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.820]   You know, it's all about character.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.060]   And early on in my upbringing,
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.060]   this was also the stage where my mom
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.940]   just poured in Bible verse songs
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.280]   like a maniac in the best way.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.580]   And so all of those songs
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.140]   are very much flooding back to my mind,
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.700]   but it's helpful to give your child
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.100]   something good to think about
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.080]   while you're trying to redirect them.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.420]   And what better to give them than the truth?
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.340]   So while we're exploring,
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.580]   of course we're talking about,
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.100]   you know, and God made those birds.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.700]   The other day we were feeding our chickens
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.820]   and Leo said, "You know, God made those chickens."
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.100]   - Yes, yes.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.620]   - He made you too, you know?
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.220]   So we talk about him all day,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.460]   but we're also very much focusing
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.540]   on just learning the word of God
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.980]   and hiding it in our hearts.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.860]   - Oh, that was beautiful.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.380]   - Yeah, when I read this verse,
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.740]   or when I read this question,
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.140]   I thought of the verse Romans 11, 36.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.300]   "For from him and through him and to him
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.700]   "are all things and to him be the glory."
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.500]   And I think that's really the essence
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.700]   of a robust education is understanding
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.820]   that it's all about God,
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.680]   kind of like what you were just saying, Charity.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.740]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that's so lovely.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:34.580]   That's so lovely.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.220]   So we got the classical, we got the Christian.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.900]   What kind of community are you guys looking for?
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.780]   What kind of community do you want or need?
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.060]   And is it different at every age?
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.580]   Now, Delise, you might not be able to answer,
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.260]   is it different at every age yet?
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.580]   'Cause you only know this age.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:59.140]   But what kind of community are you hoping for
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.780]   or building for you and Leo,
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.960]   for your family to learn with?
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:10.380]   - Well, I'm hoping for and pursuing two types of community.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.700]   I would say probably the latter
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.140]   a little bit more than this first one.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:20.140]   So first, I really do love moms who understand my values.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.620]   I do have a slightly unconventional approach
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.660]   and perspective on young childhood development.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.180]   And especially I've mentioned screens,
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.460]   but physical play and even messy learning,
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.620]   just the fact that sometimes you need to make a mess
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.480]   and that's kind of the point.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   And they learn as they make a mess
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.220]   and cover themselves and whatever it is.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.540]   And you can clean that up.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.780]   You can teach them that lesson or whatever that thing is
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.500]   without giving them a chance to interact
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.620]   with the material. - Oh, my word, yes.
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.480]   - Which is fun and the aftermath is a different story.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.660]   - Yes, but we can just always deal with that.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.060]   - Yeah, we can always deal with that.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.100]   And I'm not saying every day I'm excited about the mess,
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.620]   but it's nice to be around other moms who understand that
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.260]   and who are pursuing those same goals.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.980]   But I will say what matters even more to me
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.820]   than people agreeing with me
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.540]   is being around people who have been there
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.660]   and are truly looking in the rear view.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.180]   So my friends who have children in college
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.500]   are the ones I'm really budding up next to right now,
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.940]   just because I think I'm in the crucial years,
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.600]   you know, the zero to five foundational years.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.220]   And they have a lot of wisdom to share
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.580]   and I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.420]   And so I need somebody who's been there before
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.660]   who can kind of at least say,
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.820]   yeah, keep going in that direction or you're not crazy,
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.260]   that's a problem, keep addressing it.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.860]   - Right, exactly.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.820]   - Oh my word, I remember in those early days,
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.300]   and that's what, I loved practicum
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.340]   because I could go and I could hear moms
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.740]   who, like you said, were a little ahead of me on the journey
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.940]   and they could say, oh yeah, girl, that's fine.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.660]   That's not the problem you think it is
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.940]   or that's getting ready to resolve
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.640]   or here's what you could try or, you know,
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.820]   count your blessings, that's not so bad.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.460]   And I could look and see that perseverance,
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.760]   what perseverance did in their family
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.580]   was to mold their children, like they kept on doing it.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.140]   And so I agree, I want people who are ahead of me
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:35.140]   on the journey who can give me some mentoring advice.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.980]   Hearing you, Delisa, makes me wish that you
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.860]   and my daughter, Sarah, lived closer together
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.460]   because those are the kinds of things
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.580]   that she likes to do, experiences they don't watch.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.980]   They don't watch screens, he listens to a lot of music.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.180]   And so he has very eclectic musical taste.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.820]   When Gideon was a baby,
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.340]   what soothed him the most was Handel's "Messiah."
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.420]   - Oh, thank you, exactly.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.620]   - Oh my gosh, that is so fun.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.620]   And so when he comes to my house, he gets out of the car
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.980]   and the first thing he wants to do is dig
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.120]   because one day he found a trowel
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.700]   and that was one of his early big words, a trowel.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.640]   I need the trowel, Lolly, the trowel.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.060]   And so the only way he can learn about the trowel
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.140]   is to really get it the dirt under his fingers
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.340]   and so he does it.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.660]   So that's really cool.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.260]   Charity, what kind of community did you seek for your kids
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.940]   as they were older, you know?
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.940]   What kind of community did they need
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.660]   and was it the same thing that you needed?
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.660]   - So I think what you want and what you get
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.940]   are sometimes two different things.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.160]   And for our family, that just happened
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.560]   to be the way it turned out.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.300]   One of the things that I have focused on with the kids
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.580]   as communities came and went over the years,
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.820]   or we moved actually,
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.340]   and so then you have a whole different world,
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.820]   is that in the same way that Christostom is known
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.180]   for saying that a home should be a little church
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.180]   and the best churches are those where it's a combination
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.240]   of all the little churches.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.900]   And unless church is happening in the home,
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.980]   church as a body is stunted, right?
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.140]   And so what we try to teach our children,
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.780]   because we did have such a flux in formal community
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.740]   as we moved, is that what we have at home
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.660]   is the little community.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:28.940]   And in the years where the larger community wasn't present
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.460]   or wasn't ideal, we could still have our little community.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.760]   And so the best communities out there, in my opinion,
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.380]   especially CC communities, are those that are combination
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.480]   of people doing community with their families.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.460]   And if they're loving one another well in the home,
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.160]   then they will love and learn well together
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.380]   in the community.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.380]   And so for our children, what we have saw
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.420]   as they have gotten older is more and more and more
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.580]   understanding the importance of the most local community,
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.300]   which is the home, that can spill over
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.220]   into the other communities that we put them into.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.120]   And so that's been our emphasis in the last number of years.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.500]   - Oh, that's very wise.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.780]   And probably is very encouraging to listeners
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:17.540]   who maybe find themselves without an outside-the-home
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.060]   community right now, or who are not
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.700]   sure that the outside-their-home community that they have found
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.940]   completely fits them.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.900]   That gives us a different perspective, Charity,
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.540]   and I appreciate that.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.900]   That is awesome.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.740]   All right, guys, I have some light-hearted questions
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.540]   for you, because we've been serious for a few minutes.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.740]   So I feel like we need to stretch our muscles
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:41.540]   a little bit.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.180]   What-- Delise, I want to ask you this.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:52.420]   What, so far, has been your funniest homeschool moment?
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.740]   - OK.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.960]   I wasn't sure if I was going to share the story,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.300]   but you're asking the question, so here we are.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:05.020]   So Leo is very interested right now in learning Spanish.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.340]   And you want to encourage your child's curiosity
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.780]   and feed that.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.460]   And so we were in the very beginning stages--
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.140]   still are-- of teaching him some Spanish words.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.320]   - Oh, that's cool.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.700]   - We went to the grocery store, and the cashier
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.660]   had a Spanish accent.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.420]   I have no idea where she was from.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:27.500]   And Leo was convinced that this woman was speaking Spanish.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.740]   So he starts talking to her, and he says,
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.460]   why is she speaking Spanish to me?
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.420]   I said, well, honey, she's not speaking Spanish.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.380]   She's speaking English.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.100]   And he says, yeah, she is speaking Spanish.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.220]   And then she starts to talk to him.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.620]   She said, no, I'm speaking English.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.300]   You know, she's being very sweet to him.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.300]   And he starts speaking back to her, of course,
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.300]   because she is speaking in English.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.900]   Yes, Laura is speaking Spanish.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:46.860]   Do you get it or not?
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.540]   And then he starts to try out words
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.340]   that he thinks are Spanish--
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.300]   "tito" and things like that.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.960]   And it was just--
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.300]   it was one of those moments where you think to yourself,
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.300]   I'm so glad that I taught this child to ask questions.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.140]   And I need you to stop right now.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.220]   Yes.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.900]   Yes.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.660]   That is so funny.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.460]   You spend all these years just waiting for your child
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.700]   to be able to talk and communicate these thoughts
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.180]   that you can tell that they have.
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.020]   And then they begin to speak.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.140]   And they sometimes don't stop.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.820]   And you think, wow, I prayed for this.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.420]   And now I really got it.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.580]   That's great.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.860]   That's great.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.420]   Let me ask you this, Charity.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:35.780]   Are you fun mom or sergeant mom?
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.700]   Well, can I say I'm both?
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.820]   Yes, you can.
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.020]   I was going to say, I would-- if I were you,
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.340]   I'd cheat at this question.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.860]   I'm going to cheat at this question.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.860]   I would say I'm both.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.540]   And the reason is that I would say
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:54.820]   I'm sergeant mom in the sense that I personally--
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.780]   aside from my children, I personally
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.300]   need lots of structure in my world.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.980]   I get up at the same time every day.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.500]   I go on the walk at the same park every day.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.140]   I just need structure because it helps clear my head.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.020]   It helps keep me focused.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.660]   And I would say that I'm--
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.500]   this is kind of an irony.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.900]   People have said to me, well, you're
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.300]   so structured and so disciplined.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.660]   You must be a strong person.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.580]   I would say that I'm structured and disciplined
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.140]   because I'm a weak person.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.340]   If you take away the structure, I may become, like,
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.820]   I don't know, completely chaotic.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.980]   So I'm a sergeant in that way.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.940]   But I'm definitely a sergeant first to myself.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.860]   And then that trickled over into the structure
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.020]   in the homeschool.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:40.260]   But I'm also the mom who is going to do lots of outdoor,
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.020]   lots of hiking, lots of--
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.580]   of course, you can take off your shoes
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:48.080]   and wade in the stream out in the middle of the park.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.500]   And then, of course, you're going
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.140]   to walk in your nasty, gritty socks
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.860]   and complain all the way back to the car
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.820]   because your mom didn't think that through first.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.500]   Yes, yes.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.820]   But, yeah, I would say I'm a combo.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.060]   I'm a combo of those two things.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.780]   That's cool.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.980]   And your children probably are the better
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.740]   for you being both of those things
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.140]   because they now know how to keep a schedule
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.180]   and how to break a schedule.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.460]   So that's a good thing.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.700]   Delise, what about you?
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:24.260]   Yeah, Delise, are you fun mom, sergeant mom, or a combo?
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.220]   Oh, yeah, I was definitely going to cheat, too.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.740]   I was not going to be trapped into these boxes.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.740]   Yeah, I would say I'm some of both.
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:36.460]   Again, these early years are about structure.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.700]   But I agree with you, Charity.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.820]   I mean, I need the structure just to think straight.
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.020]   And I mean, not everything has to be structured.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.180]   But I would say about 85% is going to really help me out.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.540]   And then there's freedom in that.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.980]   I'm a very creative person.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:55.140]   And having constraints breeds creativity.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.740]   And so I've found that to be helpful even in just saying,
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.180]   like, hey, we're just going to do our structured learning
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.340]   in the morning.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.740]   And so then I just tell myself, all right,
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.820]   we did what we were going to do.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.100]   And everything else is a bonus.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.780]   You know, then we have all these ideas of things
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.860]   that we want to do and structure and learn.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.980]   But this is where we got the early stuff out.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.300]   And so, yeah, I'm a little bit of both right now.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.740]   And we will see if that continues to be the case.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.820]   I bet that it will, Delise.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.660]   I bet that it will.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.220]   I think I was some of both, too.
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.660]   I'm also very--
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.260]   I always have a plan.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.540]   And I like to have a plan.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.020]   And if you don't have a plan, I probably have one for you
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:34.900]   already.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:40.740]   And so we did, especially in the younger years,
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.180]   our homeschool day was more structured.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.340]   Now, it wasn't rigid.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:50.180]   We didn't do things from 11 to 1110 and from 1120 to 1145.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:54.620]   But we did things in the same order, basically, every day.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.420]   There was a rhythm and a pattern to our days.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.900]   And for little children, I will say that for young children,
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:07.260]   structure and rhythm and pattern are very comforting.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.980]   They actually prefer to know what is going to happen.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.020]   And they know enough about themselves
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:18.220]   to not actually want to be in charge of all their choices.
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.020]   It feels safe.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:25.900]   And it breeds security for them to have a predictable routine.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.420]   But yeah, I like to be in the fun mom who could just say,
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.860]   yep, OK, we're going to do math upstairs.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.860]   We're doing fractions.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.020]   And so we're going to bake.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:37.260]   We're going to learn fractions by baking.
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.580]   Or, OK, we're going to go do our memory work by kicking
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.460]   the soccer ball back and forth to each other.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:47.180]   So it is fun to be the fun mom.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.540]   I also actually happen to think that you can be the fun mom
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.180]   more often if there's a little bit of structure in your life.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.340]   But that might just be me.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.420]   Let me ask you this.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.140]   This is one of the last questions
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.380]   that I want to ask you.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.500]   But it's very profound.
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.620]   And it's something, I will be honest,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.260]   I did not realize early on.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.780]   I thought I was doing this great—I
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.540]   was making this great commitment to homeschool my children,
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.580]   to follow God, what I thought the Lord was asking us.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.620]   My husband and I both felt like the Lord is saying,
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.940]   do this homeschool thing.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:30.040]   And I felt like I was doing this great thing for the Lord
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.260]   and this great thing for my children.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:39.580]   And I have since seen how the Lord has blessed me personally
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.700]   through homeschooling and through this journey.
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:47.460]   And He has refined me, not that He's done.
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.340]   He continually is refining me.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.660]   But He refined me a lot in the process.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:57.580]   There was a lot I learned about myself and about the Lord
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.860]   and about His goodness and faithfulness to me.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:06.580]   I want to know how homeschooling has changed you.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.500]   Charity, how has homeschooling changed you?
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:15.540]   Homeschooling is such a sanctifying experience.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:21.180]   And I feel like in the early years, I'm a planner, too.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.300]   And I love that you said, if you don't have a plan,
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.140]   I will plan for you.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.700]   That is me.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.180]   That is completely me.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.100]   I know that we had a joke in our family in the early years
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.700]   that if I wrote out the lesson plans--
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.700]   because I actually had a planner in the old days.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.900]   I had like an actual from the teacher's store.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.500]   I went and got a planner, the green book.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:47.140]   If I wrote the lesson plans in pen, someone would get sick.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.020]   It was like the curse of the pen written.
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:54.660]   And I know in Alabama, we say pen, pen, an ink pen.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.280]   The curse of the ink lesson plans, right?
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.900]   And if we wrote it in pencil, things went better.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.940]   I know that seems like a little bit of a--
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.820]   that's ridiculous.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.940]   But that's how it felt to us.
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:12.460]   And I had so many more--
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.620]   I held my plans much more close to my heart
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.860]   when the children were little.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.340]   And I was much more distressed by the way
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:27.700]   that life interrupted and all the magic and flowers
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.940]   and unicorns that I'd planned for that week
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.140]   went up in smoke when the children got the flu
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.380]   or whatever.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.940]   And so I feel like homeschooling has
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.620]   allowed me to be OK with writing my plans in pencil
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.780]   and finding out that when all you have to offer
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.700]   is a couple of loaves and some fishes,
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.980]   that Jesus makes it enough.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.940]   They are going to be OK.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.380]   They actually are.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.940]   And I know that when my daughter came to me on her very
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.420]   last day of homeschool, we printed out
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.540]   her transcript on my printer.
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.060]   And we literally stood at the printer and cried together.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.900]   Yes, yes.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.580]   It wasn't a throw confetti in the air
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.300]   because homeschooling was hard.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.140]   It was hard for her.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:12.940]   It was hard for me.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.780]   Our personalities didn't jive perfectly.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.540]   We had a lot of hard days.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.180]   But Jesus wrote a different story.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.340]   And his story was beautiful.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.340]   And I'm just so grateful for how he's changed me
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.340]   through homeschooling.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.500]   That's so beautiful.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.860]   You have moved me to tears.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.180]   When you talked about standing at the printer,
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:34.420]   because I remember as the homeschooling mom,
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.220]   the homeschooling lead learner, the homeschooling school
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:41.500]   administrator, you have to generate all these documents
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.300]   when your children graduate.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.780]   And so as I built their transcripts
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:52.060]   and as I wrote the description of the type of education
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.940]   they had had, I truly cried.
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.620]   And I thought, I could never have envisioned this.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.260]   When my little girls were second grade and fifth grade,
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:07.660]   I could never envision that the Lord would have brought us all
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:11.340]   through all the things that we learned
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.180]   and all the ways that we learned and all the understanding
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.780]   that we had gained.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.940]   And it was a moving and beautiful thing.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.580]   He is very kind.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.540]   He is a very kind and good father.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.300]   He is a good, good father.
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.340]   That's what I was going to say.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:32.580]   So Delise, how is homeschooling changing you?
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:41.860]   Well, as a person who has only ever truly known these waters,
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.460]   aside from going to university, I
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:48.900]   think it would be easy to think, oh, I know what I'm doing.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.820]   Which is not the case.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.620]   And so even though I've only been at it for three years,
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.180]   it has been very humbling and also so reassuring,
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.060]   because I'm a very inquisitive person.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.900]   And so I've always been the kind of person
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.380]   who had a lot of questions for God.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.780]   And I'll write my questions down.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.100]   And I'm digging through my Bible asking very specific questions.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.820]   And he's very kind, as you guys just said, and gracious.
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.900]   And he often answers my questions.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.900]   He humors me, is what I like to say.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.540]   He shows me himself in his word.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.180]   But I've seen him do that with homeschooling, too,
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.820]   when I'm confused or I don't understand--
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.100]   because my son is very different than I am--
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.060]   the way that he thinks and what I need to say.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.020]   Because he's asking me things that I never
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.700]   thought about before.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.500]   Or he's just a boy.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.740]   And so he wants to express himself in ways
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:43.220]   that I simply don't relate.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.780]   But the Lord has been kind already.
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:49.500]   And then just showing me himself and giving me
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:53.540]   wisdom as a mom, I believe, but also just showing me
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:58.540]   that my value is not in what I do.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.620]   And that's something I want to communicate to my son,
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.540]   that his value is not in what he does or even other people's
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.260]   perspective of his performance.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:13.020]   But I think when we homeschool and we do create the grades
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.780]   ourselves, it's easy to want to hear other people tell us,
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.500]   well done.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.260]   And I just have to be honest with myself
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.140]   and say, you know what, Lord?
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.700]   I'm doing this because I feel called to do this.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.940]   And at the end of the day, only you see my every day.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.060]   And so only you can give me that thumbs up that I'm looking for.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.540]   And he's not going to give that to me
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.820]   based on my, quote, "performance."
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.740]   I already belong to him.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.740]   Yes.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.020]   Oh.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.060]   That's where my mind is right now.
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.900]   That is awesome.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.300]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.460]   That's a great place for us to end.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.740]   It's a good thought to leave us all with.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.500]   Our value is not in what we do.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.100]   Our value is in the Lord.
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.700]   So moms and dads who are listening, who think,
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.300]   I'm not doing all I should.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.700]   I know I'm failing.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.060]   Your value is not in what you do.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.420]   It is in the Lord.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:15.260]   And so I fully believe, as I can tell Charity and Delise,
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.900]   believe that the Lord will give you what you need.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:24.500]   And He is, you know, your children might be your project,
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.460]   but you are God's project.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.860]   You are God's to love.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.220]   And He is going to do a great work in you.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.900]   Ladies, thank you so much for talking to me
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:40.700]   about your homeschool experience and sharing your wisdom
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.580]   with all of us today.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:43.780]   That is awesome.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:50.180]   I want to tell you listeners about another way for you
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.740]   to maybe interact with some new ideas.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.740]   And of course, I guess it's not really a conversation
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.380]   if you're just doing the reading.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:05.940]   But very soon, our 2025 catalog will be available.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.860]   And I want you to know, the catalog is not just a way
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.260]   for you to find resources you need to buy for next year.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.700]   The catalog is full of great articles,
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:22.980]   like "The Need for Community" and "His Grace is Sufficient"
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.900]   and "Skills to Love Your Neighbor."
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:30.300]   These are great reads that feed our souls,
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.540]   that encourage and equip us.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.860]   And life is busy.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.100]   So here's the deal.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:40.340]   You don't have to read the articles yourself.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.820]   You can actually download audio versions
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.820]   of these articles that are found in the catalog
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.860]   and listen while you're in the car or working out.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.780]   You can even forward an episode to a friend that
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.060]   has really resonated with you.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.420]   You can listen wherever you stream podcasts.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:06.020]   You just search "Classical Conversations Catalog Podcast."
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:14.380]   Or you can go to classicalconversations/catalog-articles.com.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.460]   All right.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.300]   Some great things to take with you on the road.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.300]   Delese, Charity, thank you again so much for being with us today.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:24.540]   I appreciate both of you.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.020]   Thank you.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.220]   This was fun.
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:26.700]   All right.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.500]   Bye, guys.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
