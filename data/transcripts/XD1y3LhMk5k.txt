[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   The way I think about a glucose monitor, first of all, I'll say the purpose of the glucose
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.160]   monitor is not to game the system and get flat glucose.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.000]   The purpose of the glucose monitor is curiosity.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.080]   It's to start to understand how essentially an MRI for how all of our different dietary
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.280]   and lifestyle strategies are creating this readout of glucose in our body, which I think
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   can be really interesting.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.920]   And in a world where so many cards are stacked against us with diet and lifestyle and where
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.240]   there's a lot of confusion about what's right for us, that can be very helpful in actually
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.360]   reducing the confusion and the cognitive load of our choices.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.360]   We know that keeping your blood sugar through the course of a lifetime in a low and healthy
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.080]   range, so I don't mean up and down spikes during the day, but keeping your blood sugar
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.360]   healthy throughout the course of your lifetime is probably the best thing we can do for longevity,
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.400]   staying insulin sensitive, staying out of the diabetic range.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.120]   And so one thing the glucose monitor does for us is just give us more awareness and
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.320]   agency into what the trends of our glucose are over time, as opposed to a literally one
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.200]   data point snapshot once a year in the doctor's office, which is what the majority of us are
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   used to.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.720]   I really love the idea that people who are able to wear glucose monitors every now and
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.040]   again, maybe once a year, maybe more than once a year, they know what their glucose
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040]   is.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.280]   And so they're never going to walk into a doctor's office and have a bomb dropped on
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.600]   them about prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, because you have the data, which is ultimately
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.200]   I hope the world that we can move towards for a lot of biomarkers.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.920]   So you can see trends over time, which I think is very valuable.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.240]   One thing that's fascinating in terms of early prediction of metabolic disease is that you
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.360]   can see how long it takes your glucose to come down after a meal.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   So in a normal, healthy, insulin sensitive body, even if the glucose goes way up, it
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.240]   should come way down very quickly, because the insulin is binding to insulin receptors
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.680]   and the glucose is getting taken up, and it'll lower.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.000]   What is quickly over the course of--
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.840]   It should be down by two hours.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.320]   But from what I've actually seen in our most insulin sensitive people and also in research
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.120]   that looks at young healthy populations, you should basically be spiking and coming down,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.320]   spike about 45 minutes and come down hour and a half, 90 minutes to two hours.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   But if--
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.080]   This is after, sorry, after last bite?
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.640]   After last bite, although it's hard to kind of exactly know.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.480]   But yeah, meal is over, I would say about 45 minutes to go up to the peak and then start
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.240]   coming down very quickly.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.160]   Now if you start to see that glucose is going up and then trailing very slowly back down
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.820]   to normal, maybe taking more than two hours, three hours, that is going to be one of those
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.080]   early indicators of potential insulin resistance.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.280]   Your body's not clearing the glucose, but that's not a metric that we use in standard
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.600]   practice at all.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.040]   And I've actually seen myself very insulin sensitive.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   My insulin is like 2.5, and if I don't sleep and I am stressed and I have been sitting,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.280]   my glucose will take way longer to come down.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.840]   I have become transiently insulin resistant.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.640]   So I think that's just fascinating to see that.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.920]   So looking-- what that ultimately-- the metric that we call that is area under the curve.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.080]   You want a low area under the curve, AUC, after a glucose spike.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.240]   So you want to spike and come down quickly.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.220]   That's going to-- if you shade the area under the curve, it's a small amount.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.200]   If you go up and then trail off for two to three hours, that's going to be a lot of shading
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.440]   under that curve, and high AUC is associated with insulin resistance, basically.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.360]   Another thing that you can see is essentially glycemic variability.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.600]   And glycemic variability, GV, is a metric of how spiky your curves are.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.200]   Fascinating paper out of Michael Schneider's lab at Stanford in 2018 called "Glucotypes
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.440]   Show New Patterns of Glucose Dysregulation," totally landmark study.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.040]   But basically, they put continuous glucose monitors on non-diabetic individuals who,
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.780]   by standard criteria of diabetes, do not have diabetes.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.480]   And he showed that on a CGM, a continuous glucose monitor, you have these low variability
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.520]   people that are pretty much flat throughout the day with little teeny, little teeny rolling
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.880]   hills after their meals.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.360]   You have moderately spiky people.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.120]   And then you have very spiky people who are going up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.280]   When you correlate those different patterns of glycemic variability in non-diabetic people,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.560]   you find that the spikier they are, the worse their biomarkers are metabolically across
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.520]   the board, insulin, triglycerides, et cetera.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.440]   So basically, they're showing signs through variability of underlying dysfunction that
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.080]   you would never know from a standard test.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.360]   Those are the people who I imagine are probably going to go on to develop diseases.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.480]   And yet, based on standard criteria, their doctor is telling them that they're fine,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.760]   that they're all the same.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.560]   So he also showed in that study that non-diabetic individuals, when you have a CGM on, are going
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.200]   into the diabetic range and the pre-diabetic range a fairly significant amount.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.640]   And we would never know that if you weren't actually tracking a movie of the glucose.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.380]   So glycemic variability, area under the curve, those are two things.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.640]   Another really interesting thing you can know from a CGM is dawn effect.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.680]   So dawn effect is basically a term in the literature for how high your glucose rises
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.040]   right when you wake up in the morning.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.960]   I don't know if you noticed this when you were wearing a CGM, but some people notice
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.000]   that the second they wake up, their glucose jumps up 5, 10, 20, 30 points.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.860]   What's happening here is that the cortisol awakening response to actually get you to
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.720]   wake up and get out of bed, that cortisol can cause you to dump a bunch of glucose from
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   your liver.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.120]   Because it's basically saying, stress hormone, cortisol, we got to get up.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.720]   We need glucose to fuel the muscles.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.280]   Let's dump a little glucose.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.820]   So it's normal.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.400]   But what the research shows is that magnitude of dawn effect is correlated with insulin
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   resistance.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   So the more the dawn effect you're getting, I think it can signal maybe the more stress
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.680]   you're under, the more cortisol you have floating around, how big your cortisol awakening response
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680]   is.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.240]   But also, if you imagine if you're dumping all that glucose from your liver and your
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.400]   cells aren't taking it up well because you're insulin resistant, that response, that dawn
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.640]   effect is going to be higher.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.520]   So I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but typically, I would want to see
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.200]   a dawn effect, I think, of less than 10 points.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.360]   So you wake up and you may very well see a rise.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.800]   This is absence of any food yet.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.900]   And you do not want to see that going up 20, 30, 40 points.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.720]   Some people see a little bump again with caffeine in the morning because it's more cortisol.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.200]   And so that's another thing that standard stuff would never tell you.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.960]   So those are kind of some of the looking at early predictors of metabolic dysfunction.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.520]   More of the fun stuff is actually just figuring out how is food affecting your body.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.560]   And this is where people really enjoy it and figure out, oh, my god, this food that I thought
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.760]   was healthy is actually not serving me.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.000]   And actually, a lot of people, I think, who are trying to make healthy choices-- my boyfriend,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.360]   when we started dating, he started using Levels.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   His healthy snack, he worked in Venice, would be to go to Moon Juice and get-- oh, gosh,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.760]   I don't want to throw Moon Juice under the bus here, but he would get--
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   They have some tasty stuff there.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   They do.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.320]   But he would get this green juice that was sweetened with dates, and it was $9, and this
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.360]   was the healthy choice.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.800]   And he saw, the second he put on Levels, that it was causing a huge spike, like 50, 60,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.680]   70 points, and then he was crashing.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.720]   And he was actually trying to make a good decision.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.840]   So now he's swapped his snacks out for more like grass-fed cheese and some flax crackers
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   and maybe like a venison stick or something, like grab-and-go stuff that isn't spiking
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   his glucose.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.040]   But I think it can help people figure out which foods are doing what I want them to
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.240]   do and which maybe aren't.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.720]   And same thing happened for so many of our members with oatmeal.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.200]   Unfortunately, instant oatmeal is one of the biggest spikers in our data set for breakfast,
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.720]   and a lot of people are making that choice because they think it's heart healthy.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.120]   And in many people, it's actually causing a big glucose excursion and crash.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.320]   And then in some other people, it's not.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.960]   And so it's really helping with, what are the sneaky spikers?
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.000]   And then where's the biochemical individuality?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:54.140]   And there was a phenomenal paper out of Israel from Cell about seven years ago called Personalized
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.640]   Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   It made big waves.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.520]   But it basically showed that you and I could eat the same handful of blueberries and have
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.840]   totally different glycemic responses.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.880]   So the idea of glycemic index as like a certain amount of food with a certain amount of glucose
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.320]   causes a certain glucose rise, it kind of debunked that.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.760]   And that matters because repeated sustained glycemic variability over time is not good
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   for our health.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.400]   We want to choose the foods or balance the foods that are going to keep us relatively
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.640]   more stable.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.360]   So that's very helpful, just understanding your personal response to food.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.080]   And then what are the lifestyle strategies you can use-- sleeping better, walking after
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:45.920]   meals, more resistance training, cold plunging, breath work-- that can actually serve to modulate
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.720]   the food environment to actually reduce the glucose spikes?
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.360]   And people find that all of those things can positively impact glucose spikes, especially
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.560]   the walks after the meals.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.880]   But it's been fascinating to see a lot of women, especially like menopausal women in
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.440]   our community, who find that their glucose patterns are getting worse because estrogen
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.440]   is dropping.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.360]   So that's going to really take a hit on insulin sensitivity.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.600]   They start resistance training.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   Glucose comes kind of right back down.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.720]   So because of the monitor, they can feel more confident in the intervention they've chose
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.080]   to do to help with metabolism, and that kind of creates a virtuous cycle.
