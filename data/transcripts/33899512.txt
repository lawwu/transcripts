[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.640]   Well, listeners, welcome to this episode
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.400]   of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.640]   We are running up on, believe it or not,
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.440]   the end of our first semester.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.680]   I know that lots of you are looking toward the holidays,
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.080]   some of you with great longing
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.840]   because you're gonna see family and have lots of fun.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.120]   And for students, some of them are eager to have a rest.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   And all of us know that what comes at the end
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.000]   of the semester for many parents and students
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.240]   is a little unsettling before the sweetness.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.080]   Blue Book exams loom for many of our Challenge students.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.160]   And for the younger Challenge students,
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.800]   it may be the first time they've ever had anything
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.160]   like a formal exam.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.320]   So we wanna talk about Blue Books today.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.160]   That's the whole thing.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.920]   Do Blue Books make you blue?
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   Does it make you worried or nervous or anxious or sad
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.520]   or just thoughtful when you contemplate
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.200]   creating Blue Book exams for your students?
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.520]   Or when you contemplate helping your students
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.240]   get ready for the Blue Book exams
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   that they will experience in community.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.680]   So today, I have one of my best friends,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.120]   I got Kelly Wilt with me.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.080]   Kelly is a great creative thinker.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.200]   And I will tell you,
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   she is a Challenge 3 tutor this fall.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   And if I could go and sit in her classroom,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.160]   I would be happy at least once every week.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.280]   It sounds to me, Kelly,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.240]   like you have the best time with your students.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.160]   And I happen to know that you're having
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.320]   at least as much fun as they are.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.400]   - Yes, I would say that is true.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.640]   (all laughing)
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.680]   - I thought you would be the perfect person
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.920]   to help us think about Blue Book exams
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.200]   in a way that will not leave us feeling blue.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.400]   I know that you can give parents some insights
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.840]   on the whys and hows and how to get ready,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.160]   and maybe offer some ideas
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.400]   that will not sound like the Blue Books
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.840]   we all loved to hate,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.760]   and give parents a better idea
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.600]   of what this tool can really do for them
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.360]   and for their students.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.080]   - Oh, Lisa, I'm so excited
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.400]   about the topic of this conversation,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.720]   because as a Type A student-
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.160]   - Oh my gosh, me too.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.960]   - I can tell you with certainty
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.600]   that there were times in my life
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.360]   where I had extreme testing anxiety
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.440]   because I wanted to do well.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.600]   And I felt like the letter
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.760]   that would be written at the top of that test paper
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.840]   was a treatise on me as a person.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.920]   - It was gonna define you as a student, right?
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   And that's how I felt.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.600]   It was gonna define me as a student
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.760]   in the eyes of my teacher,
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.600]   in the eyes maybe of my parents,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.720]   certainly in my own eyes.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.440]   And so that was a scary thing.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.760]   That was a scary thing.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   So here's my very first question for you.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   Is assessing ever a blessing for real?
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.800]   I mean, really?
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.440]   - Well, you know, I will say this.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.240]   I think assessment can be a blessing
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.280]   depending on our perspective
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.600]   about what the word assessing
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.000]   should mean for us as classical educators.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.640]   - Okay, give us some perspective then,
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.880]   'cause I think maybe you're onto something
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.440]   that will help all of us chill out.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.960]   - Well, I'm gonna begin this conversation
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.000]   by saying I have not always done this well.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I have distinct memories as a new challenge parent
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.600]   of seeing our eldest in his challenge A room
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.000]   on community day.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.560]   And his sweet tutor knocked on the door
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.760]   where I was sitting, having fun,
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.000]   singing along with our younger two students
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.760]   who were still in foundations.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.040]   And she said, "Kelly, I need you."
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.520]   And I thought, well, that's never good.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.800]   Oh, it could be either, right?
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.120]   And I knew at that moment in time
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.760]   what my son was doing was working on his blue book exam
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.440]   because it was week 15.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.480]   And I thought, okay, what can be going on?
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.920]   So I went to the room and I discovered that my sweet boy,
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.280]   who is wonderful and very gifted,
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.200]   was curled up in the corner of the room.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.840]   - Oh, bless his heart.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.680]   It was not a blessing at the moment to him.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.920]   - It was not a blessing.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.880]   And the rest of his friends had already been excused
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.800]   to lunch and they were all playing.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.080]   And he was sitting in the corner of the room.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.320]   And so I went up to him and I said,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.480]   "Okay, you gotta tell me what's going on."
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   - I was like, what is the deal?
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.800]   - And he told me, he said,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.440]   "Mom, I just don't know everything."
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.680]   And I distinctly remember thinking to myself,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.480]   well, I don't know everything either.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.040]   - I know, it's like, okay, so that's not a revelation.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.240]   So next.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.000]   - So I looked at him and I said,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.240]   "Okay, you don't know everything,
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.680]   "but what we're here to do today
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.680]   "is to celebrate what you do know and what you've learned."
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.360]   And this look came across his face like,
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   "Wait, I'm not a failure if I don't know everything?"
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.880]   It was a step in the right direction for our family
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.440]   and for me as a future challenge director as well
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.360]   to maintain the right perspective
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.320]   about why we are assessing with blue books.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.680]   So as a challenge director,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.440]   I've done a little bit of research about this
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.200]   because my paradigm is not classical education.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.240]   I grew up private education where,
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.560]   like we've already talked a little bit
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.600]   about extreme testing anxiety
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   and feeling that a letter on a paper told me my worth
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.920]   and not only as a student, but as a person.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.040]   And as classical educators,
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.320]   that is not the mentality that we should promote.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.400]   So I looked up the word assessment
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.080]   and the root of that word comes from the Latin verb,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.800]   ad sedere, which means, and get this,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.440]   how wonderful is this?
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   Not to berate or exempt
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.080]   any other negative word we could possibly fill in,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.200]   but it means to sit near or beside
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.800]   or to give comfort or advice.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.480]   And so when I think about assessment in that way,
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.000]   it completely changed my perspective about-
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.440]   - Wow, that is completely different
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.600]   from what most of us have ever thought of assessment
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.720]   or a test or anything like that.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.240]   - Yes, so apparently this word was used
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.920]   during the time of the Roman Empire
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.160]   when a citizen would be called up to sit next to a judge.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.320]   So I can imagine there probably was some testing anxiety.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.960]   - Yes. - For instance,
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.800]   but I think if we think about assessment in this way,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.480]   that primarily it is a time for us
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.000]   to draw near to our children, to sit with them.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.160]   In other words, to see how they're doing
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.640]   and learn the best way that we can guide
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.600]   and encourage them,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.760]   it completely revolutionizes what we think
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.280]   about that time of assessment.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.280]   And for us as CC families, the time of blue books.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.520]   - You have started this off with a bang.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.080]   I think everybody has now, their shoulders have dropped.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.240]   They have sat back in their chair.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.280]   We've all heaved a big sigh of relief.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.240]   My favorite thing that you have said so far
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.120]   is that assessment is supposed to be
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.680]   a celebration of what you know.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   Instead of a liturgy of all of the things
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:39.120]   that we forgot or didn't quite grasp or didn't know.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.720]   And I absolutely love the whole,
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.000]   the mental picture that I got when you said,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   sit near or beside to give comfort, advice or encouragement.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.560]   The mental picture of that will live with me for a long time.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.640]   So parents, that's the kind of assessing
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.800]   that we're gonna talk about for the next several minutes.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.880]   Okay, let me ask you this
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.120]   because now that we're not afraid of assessment anymore,
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.800]   I still want to know,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.280]   what is it that you think we gain
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.080]   from assessing our children's understanding
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.600]   and mastery of whatever material we've covered?
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.640]   - Oh, that's such a good question.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.840]   So I think, we can look at testing,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.920]   we can look at exams or quizzes
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.720]   or anything that is quantitative in that way
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.600]   as a treatise on ourselves as well, right?
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.240]   Oh, I failed my child in this way.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.720]   But the truth is, when we assess our children,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.360]   we like we just discussed, we draw near to them.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   We learn ways that we can correct them,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.520]   ways that we can guide them.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.680]   Just by the proximity, the drawing close.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.680]   I know with our family, when it is time for blue books,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.120]   we do spend even more time side by side,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.280]   reviewing things that we've learned and read
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.440]   and experienced during that particular semester.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.040]   So really, we're gaining a greater knowledge
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.000]   of our children and what type of thinkers,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.960]   what type of thinkers are we training them to be?
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.600]   How are they connecting the ideas
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.720]   that we have intentionally brought into their lives
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   over the course of that semester?
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.920]   And so blue books really reveal to us
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.840]   how they're thinking, who they are as people,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.640]   not the deficiency, but the sufficiency
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.240]   of what they've learned that semester.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.720]   - I love that because I think that sitting near to them
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.840]   and going through the material with them
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.200]   and talking with them about the blue book
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.400]   and how to prepare and all that
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.000]   also gives us a great deal of insight
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.920]   into how our children feel about assessment
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.640]   and how they deal with the whole idea
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.440]   that they're gonna be called to account.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.160]   Even if it's not called to account and found wanting,
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.480]   there are some students that still have test anxiety,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.720]   even if mom and dad have given them every assurance
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.880]   that this is just a tool to measure.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.960]   I used to tell my students, look,
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.000]   your exam or this test or this blue book
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   is a tool to measure how well your study habits are working.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.080]   That's what it is.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.280]   But there are students
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.960]   who still get really wound up about that.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.760]   And so I think that that coming alongside of them
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.680]   and sitting with them gives us insight into their character
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.200]   and insight into their emotions
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.440]   and the way they handle stress.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.200]   And I think being right there with them
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   allows us to minister to them
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.160]   and to give them strengthening in whatever area they need.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   I can remember that we had special snack.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.200]   When we were, in the week that we were preparing
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.920]   for blue books, we had special snacks.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.280]   We had, during hot chocolate coffee break time,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.120]   we had extra goodies,
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.200]   and we might have hot chocolate more than once in a day.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.280]   We just tried to make it a sweet and reassuring time.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.720]   So that's really good perspective
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.280]   that you're offering there.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.760]   - Absolutely, well, and I really,
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.880]   I like what you said about strengthening
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.560]   because isn't that our goal
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.000]   that when we have had this time with our children,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.800]   that they feel strengthened,
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.200]   not because we are hiding any needs
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.960]   that might have presented themselves during this time
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.680]   because there may be needs.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.640]   We may look at what they are able to independently produce,
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.680]   and we may look at it and think,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.080]   "Wow, oh, I see that my child
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.920]   "just wrote one big long run on sentence."
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.720]   And so we look at that,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.400]   and obviously that's something that as parents,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   we want to course correct a little bit and say,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.240]   "You know what?
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.320]   "I know that you were writing this,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.640]   "and I love the way that you constructed your thoughts,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.160]   "and I can really see how you're growing,
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.680]   "but let's look at one thing here.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.160]   "Tell me, where's the punctuation?"
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.320]   (laughs)
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.080]   - Yes, it's an opportunity to call their attention
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.280]   to things they can work on next.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.000]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.480]   And so they feel strengthened
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.960]   because they have heard you tell them
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.000]   how much you appreciate the quality of their thoughts,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.720]   how much you like the connection,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.320]   but yet we're also not afraid
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.240]   to be able to introduce those things
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.320]   that might need a review,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.440]   that maybe when they were in the flow of thought,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.640]   they were so excited about what they were thinking
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.040]   that commas and periods were--
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.920]   - Right, just had no meaning.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.760]   (laughs)
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.720]   - That's right.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.680]   So they should feel that strengthening
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.800]   because we are walking alongside them.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.440]   We are encouraging them.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.400]   We are giving them words of affirmation,
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.520]   and we're making this a time to celebrate.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.680]   I love what you said about the hot chocolate.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.160]   And I think that applies to parents,
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.120]   and it also applies to directors too.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.760]   My goodness, how we need to celebrate that time,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.480]   that closure of the semester with our students.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.080]   - Yeah, I love that, I love that.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.120]   I was gonna ask you,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.200]   what do our children gain from assessment?
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.880]   But you already kind of answered that.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.120]   They gain a chance to recognize things
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.440]   they would like to work on.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.440]   They gain the confidence from seeing what they do
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.000]   know and how they're able to put that out there.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.880]   I think they also gain practice
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.760]   with assessing themselves and being assessed
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   so that it's not such a big, scary thing.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.960]   I think that that is one of the things that,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.760]   if we fail to assess,
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.480]   I've had families before who just said,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.760]   yes, we're not gonna do blue books.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.640]   We don't believe in blue books.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.760]   We don't believe in assessing in community.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.960]   We don't believe,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.360]   well, they were pretty much saying
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.640]   they didn't believe in assessing.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.640]   What do we lose if we don't assess?
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.200]   - Oh, that's such a good question.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.840]   I think if we don't assess and assess rightly,
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   like we've been discussing,
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.200]   I think we can lose, first of all,
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.360]   a relationship with our children
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.320]   because they are given to us.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.920]   They are treasure given to us, royalty,
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.160]   as Lee often says, worth dying for.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.400]   And I think our children need to see
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.040]   that relationship originating from us,
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.080]   that their learning is a priority to us,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.520]   that the way that they are being mentored
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.360]   and the way that they are seeing this modeling
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.800]   of lifelong learning,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.600]   there's an essence of that that is lost
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.840]   when we don't assess and when we don't,
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.640]   first of all, encourage, and then also observe.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.400]   Because they may fill in the blanks incorrectly
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.240]   in their minds.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.320]   - Right, and we don't ever know.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.760]   - Exactly.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.800]   They may think, well, I'm not worth,
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.440]   or my mother or father doesn't think I can.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.680]   And I've found quite often
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.840]   that our children rise to the expectations
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.200]   that we set for them.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.680]   You know, when I sit and I have conversations
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.920]   with our middle son,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.320]   who happens to be in my Challenge 3 class this year,
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.760]   I will say to him words like,
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.880]   "I know that you've been thinking about this,
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.760]   "and I can't wait to hear
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.480]   "how you're going to compare this to this."
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.480]   Or I will say those life-giving words to him
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.920]   that spur his heart and his soul onto nobler purpose.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.080]   Because I want him to know that I am always thinking,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.520]   you know, there's a realization that we all are sinners.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.560]   We are all sinners.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.160]   But there is a pursuit of God
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.480]   that we are all taking place in as well.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.560]   And so I want to speak words to him
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.320]   that encourage him to Christlikeness,
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.760]   that encourage him to diligence
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.720]   and excellence in what he's doing.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.240]   And so I feel like if we say,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.000]   "Oh, I'm not going to assess you.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.800]   "You know, assessment is wrong."
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.680]   You know, we also have to keep in mind
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.680]   that at the end of time,
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   we will also be assessed by the Lord as believers.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.640]   And we need to be ready.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.840]   And how do we do that? By being diligent
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.800]   with the time that he has given us.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.320]   And so I want to model that for my children.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.440]   And I'm certain that other parents do as well.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.200]   You know, we should always be pointing them in a way
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   that shows the glory of God to them in every possible way.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.680]   And that even includes blue book examinations.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.400]   - That's really, that's really good.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.800]   Okay, I just realized,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.240]   we've been talking about blue book exams
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.960]   and we did not define our terms.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.040]   So there may be some listeners who are saying,
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.800]   "Okay, now what does blue have to do with assessing?
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.560]   "And what is a blue book?"
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.400]   So first of all, in a minute,
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   I want you to tell what is a blue book exam.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.360]   And then I want you to talk a little bit
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.800]   how, why we as classical educators
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.480]   choose to assess using blue book exams
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.320]   instead of the old multiple guess,
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.240]   matching, short answer essay tests
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.080]   that we used to maybe have as students ourselves.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.880]   - We should have started with defining our terms.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.400]   - I just was so excited to get your thoughts on this.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.320]   I forgot.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.880]   - Well, from what I can tell,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.040]   historically blue books began as examinations
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.280]   that were offered on the collegiate level
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.880]   just before the Civil War era.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.560]   And so a lot of them were just pieces of paper
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.440]   that were attached together
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.960]   and they were given to students
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.960]   and students could answer questions within the booklets.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.320]   And then the booklets will be given back
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.720]   to the professor or the teacher
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.960]   and they would be examined and marked.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.160]   So that's the history of what originally
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.840]   a blue book was intended to be.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.120]   But, you know, within classical conversations,
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.840]   we do assess in the way that we've been discussing.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.920]   We look for growth.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.360]   We would never dream of looking at our children's blue book,
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.440]   their book of pages with questions
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   and writing an F or a D or a C, you know, on that essay.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.920]   So when we look at blue books,
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.240]   the thing that we remember about them
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.440]   is that we are gleaning our children's thoughts
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.760]   about important topics or conversations
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.960]   that they've encountered during that semester
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.560]   within their challenge classes.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.240]   So foundations parents, essentials parents,
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.440]   you know, blue books are not a reality for them,
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.720]   although they should still be having these conversations
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.280]   with their children at home throughout the week.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.360]   This period of assessment, at least in this manner,
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.000]   doesn't really come into play
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.360]   until your student is in challenge A
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.160]   and it continues all the way through challenge four.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.280]   - Good, good.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.160]   All right, and we use the blue book format
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.040]   because it is more like having a conversation, you know?
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.320]   It's sort of like the student,
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.520]   as they're answering the big prompt,
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.520]   the big question posed by their tutor or by you.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.240]   If you choose to give a blue book exam at some point,
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   they are actually responding to that question
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   with the conversation about what they've learned.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   And so it gives them a chance to say
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.120]   everything they want to say.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.360]   I always hated, well, first of all,
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.520]   I didn't love matching
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.960]   because it just seemed like such a waste.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.680]   I know so much more than just these labels.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.200]   I hated multiple, I call them multiple guess
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.160]   because there were always some
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.840]   that were designed to trick you, okay?
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.040]   When we're doing assessment,
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.840]   we're not trying to trick our students.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.280]   We're actually trying to have a good conversation
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.720]   about deep ideas and turn them over in our minds,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.920]   not trick you into picking the wrong answer.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.440]   So I hated that.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.000]   And even the short answer did not sometimes
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.720]   give me the scope to tell everything I knew
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.960]   or actually sometimes I don't know exactly
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.880]   what you're asking me,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.000]   but I know a whole lot of other stuff.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.600]   And so I could really impress you
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.880]   with all the other stuff I knew
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.080]   if you would just give me a little more scope
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.480]   for my imagination.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.520]   Anyway, that's why we use blue books
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.400]   instead of the old ways.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.040]   Now, here comes a good question
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.800]   that I know you're gonna shine at
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.840]   'cause I've heard some of your ideas already.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.920]   So tutors, directors, if you're listening,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.320]   Kelly is going to give you some ideas
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.880]   on how to make blue book exams fun,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.760]   illuminating adventures.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.720]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.680]   I love the thought of surprising the students
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.040]   that are in my challenge class
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.160]   because I think that they,
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.800]   regardless of how we have these conversations
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.080]   about assessment,
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.520]   always carry a little bit of dread
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   because they want to not be found wanting.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.120]   And so one thing that I have done with my class
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.120]   as a director that has just reaped tremendous benefits,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.960]   not only for me, but my students,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.360]   is that at the beginning of the year,
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.640]   I gift each of them a journal.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.040]   They bring this journal to class
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   and they are told that it must not leave the table
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.200]   the entire time on community day.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.040]   - Yes.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.440]   - They know when I say clean the table,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   that that means that this journal,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.160]   which also happens to be blue this year, ironically.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.000]   - How funny.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.840]   - Stays on the table.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.760]   So I'll tell them, get out your blue books.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.720]   And I really didn't intend it to be an association,
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.320]   but what I've told them is this is your treasure chest.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.240]   This is your treasure chest to fill with wisdom
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.920]   and knowledge that you glean throughout the year.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.280]   So we're having a conversation on Julius Caesar
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.800]   and an amazing thought comes to you.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.760]   You need to whip out that journal
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.880]   and you need to jot it down.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.480]   And it has been so heartening to me as a director this year,
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.240]   as in challenge three,
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.320]   students quite often get the opportunity
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.480]   to lead on community day,
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.240]   to see the young men and women in our class
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.160]   pull out that journal
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.840]   and they have these Pentecost aha moments.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.640]   And they're just writing furiously.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   And I don't try to micromanage those moments,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:53.240]   but one thing that I do for them at the end of the day
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.600]   is I'll set aside 10 minutes to reflect
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.720]   at the end of the day.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.800]   And I think that in the past,
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   they very much were of the mindset,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.160]   we're just gonna put all of our things away
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.400]   and we're just gonna roll on here.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.840]   - Right, right.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.880]   - I told them, I said at the end of the day,
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.440]   it's time for you to reflect on what the information,
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.040]   the experiences that you have encountered on community day.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.160]   And so I get them to pull out that blue book journal
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.400]   one more time.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.320]   And I write three words on the whiteboard.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   The three words are collect, connect and create.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.840]   And so the first week that I wrote those three words
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.040]   that they were copying those words into their journal.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.560]   And then one of the young men in my class said,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.520]   "Okay, well, I'll see you next week."
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.960]   And I said, "Not so fast."
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.240]   I said, "You need to write three sentences
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.880]   "next to these three words.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.120]   "One sentence to collect is a sentence of something new
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.100]   "that you learned today.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.000]   "Maybe you learned that Eratosthenes was a librarian
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.200]   "who measured the circumference of the earth
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.400]   "using a well and an obelisk."
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.800]   (laughs)
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.640]   Pretty cool.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.040]   Then next to the word connect,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.560]   you need to think about something
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.840]   that you heard discussed today
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.120]   and how that relates to something that you already knew.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   So maybe you already knew that pi equals 3.14,
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.720]   but today we used pi in a way that you had never used it
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.320]   before in your law studies.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.700]   So you knew something
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.960]   and you connected new information to that.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.800]   But I think the third word to me
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.520]   is the word that has produced the most fruit, create.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.160]   And this comes back to,
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.240]   hearkens back to that thinking about coming alongside.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.740]   I tell them next to the word create,
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.280]   write something that you learned today
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   and how it will change who you are as a person.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.600]   Because really, when we think about assessment,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.620]   we want to think about,
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.360]   we have eternal souls that have been given into our care.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.620]   What are they encountering
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.680]   that's going to change them for eternity?
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.160]   And so they will write next to the word create
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.880]   that new idea, that new thing.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.460]   And occasionally from time to time,
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.560]   I'll say before you go,
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.240]   I'd love to hear your create from today.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.720]   And it is interesting to me to see,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.840]   rather than us packing up all of our bags
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:33.080]   and squealing our wheels as we're leaving on community day,
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:38.080]   that they leave in a time of thoughtful reflection
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.700]   about what they have encountered during the day.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.540]   So as a director, what I plan to do
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.340]   and what I have done in the past is to,
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.660]   as we're having these great conversations on community day,
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.860]   I've been jotting them down
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.700]   so that when we get to the end of this semester
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.000]   I'm thinking what would be the most effective questions
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.840]   for me to answer?
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.600]   It's not those fill in the blank,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   matching the A, B, A not B, A and B.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.960]   (laughing)
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.320]   Types of questions.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.400]   But instead it's questions about,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   for example, what did you, what play,
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.800]   for example, for challenge three,
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.880]   we learn to read Shakespeare.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.220]   So it would be me asking a question about,
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.620]   for instance, when we read "Much Ado About Nothing,"
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.120]   when your friend led the conversation in community
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.020]   about loyalty and trust in marriage,
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.320]   what did you determine as a guiding principle
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.920]   to take with you as you look
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.820]   for a marriage partner for life?
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.860]   You know, and here, you know, and I'll say,
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.860]   you know, give references, play to support your position.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.900]   And so it's this moment of not only thinking about,
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.600]   okay, who was the author of the play?
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.840]   Who were the characters in the play?
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.880]   All of the trivia.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.080]   Yes.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.640]   But you're connecting it to something in their lives,
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.800]   which is what is going to make that memorable for life.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.320]   Because now it's part of their own experience
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.200]   and their own hopes and dreams.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   Exactly.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.920]   And how much more meaning, you know,
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.280]   does that have to them?
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.680]   Because they are connecting it.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.540]   Choices that they're going to have to make
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.720]   and challenge consequences that are going to come
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.900]   from those choices that show, you know,
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.020]   their pursuit of God,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.940]   their pursuit of His will for their life,
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.940]   that growth that goes so far beyond just matching A, B, C, D.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:41.800]   It really is a reflection of who they are and their souls.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.940]   And to me, that is some valuable assessment.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.260]   That is good.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.780]   And, you know, that would be a much more illuminating
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.660]   question to answer, I think,
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.340]   because it would call upon your students
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.820]   to remember what they've studied, what they've read,
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.800]   what y'all have discussed,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   but also put it into a frame that they intend
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.060]   to use later on in life.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.740]   That's very illuminating.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.420]   And I think it would be more fun, too.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.660]   What have you done to make Blue Books fun in the past?
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.740]   Or what preview can we give your students
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.360]   of how you're going to make it fun?
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.200]   Oh, goodness.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.660]   I have, I try to come up with some crazy idea
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.760]   for every weekend.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.660]   So I have brought in fun snacks.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.920]   We have done our Blue Books, you know,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.140]   in different places in the building where we currently meet.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.140]   I remember one year,
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.540]   this probably wasn't the wisest decision,
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.300]   but I brought in cans of Mountain Dew,
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.580]   and I gave one to each of them,
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.580]   and I said, "You can do this."
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.420]   Oh, my word.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.540]   And I told them they couldn't drink it
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.700]   until they were done with their Blue Books.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.540]   Well, that's good.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.700]   And then you can send them home all hyped up
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.820]   on the sugar from Mountain Dew.
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.660]   That's perfect.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.900]   You know, I try really hard
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.980]   to create an atmosphere of celebration.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.420]   So we are planning, you know, those fun snacks.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.980]   We're planning lots of time to stretch legs,
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.020]   and to take away some of the testing anxiety.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.620]   One of the things that I always offer to my students
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.620]   is the fact that they may not have enough time
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.720]   on community day to be able to express their thoughts,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.960]   because they're having to put together their thoughts,
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.700]   they're having to get information together,
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.380]   and then to be able to write that and articulate that.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.740]   Sometimes there are obstacles to that being done
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.540]   to the extent they would like.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.100]   And so what I have asked them to do for me is this.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.260]   I say, "Choose one color of ink for community day.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.300]   Then you're going to take your Blue Book home,
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.220]   and you're going to show it to your family.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.620]   And if you feel at that point,
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.000]   there's more that you want to express,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.780]   change the color of ink or pencil that you were using,
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.420]   and keep on writing, keep on expressing."
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.740]   Because really, this is supposed to be,
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.980]   to us as parents, a coming alongside.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.740]   If I'm looking at my son's or my daughter's Blue Book,
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.420]   and I see that they have very little written
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.460]   in the time that they were given,
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.220]   well, I might want to know more.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.260]   And maybe there was something else that happened.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.420]   Maybe they were late getting back from lunch,
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:29.420]   or maybe in the case of teenagers, they were hungry.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.860]   - Right.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.060]   Absolutely fantastic.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.260]   There are actually some children that for whatever reason,
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.700]   the question, the way it was posed,
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.620]   didn't resonate with them or did not call forth from them.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.940]   I know one of my daughters, I was surprised.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.460]   Like you said, you read the question,
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.180]   and then you see this tiny little response.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.060]   And because we have sat next to them,
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.580]   and we do know what they know,
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.860]   and we have had the deep conversations,
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.460]   we know that's not all there is
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.220]   inside your head about that.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.460]   And so I was able to reframe the question sometimes,
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.220]   and she's like, "Oh, well, yes."
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.860]   And this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.020]   And so sometimes as parents,
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.180]   it is a kindness to come home and reframe
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.660]   and allow that student to realize
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.660]   that they did know a lot more
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.140]   than they were able to write down in that moment.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.420]   That is a fantastic suggestion, Kelly.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.420]   I love it.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.060]   One other thing that I'm offering to parents as well,
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.300]   prior to Blue Books,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.500]   this is the first time that I've tried this,
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.660]   but just offering this in the spirit of sharing
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.140]   with other directors who may be in the same boat.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.020]   I have been accumulating these questions and thoughts
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.420]   throughout the semester,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.820]   and I am planning to email that list to the parents
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.020]   of the students in my class so they can see
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.380]   these are the conversations that we're having.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.540]   And I try to do that on a weekly basis
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.580]   as I communicate with them by email,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.980]   just giving them, "Here's some suggested questions
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.300]   "to continue the conversation
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.940]   "with your student at home this week."
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.500]   Yeah, because they're not in the classroom all the time.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.900]   Some parents are, but other parents have littles,
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.540]   or they need to be somewhere else on community day,
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.060]   serving as a director, perhaps in another group,
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.820]   or as an essentials tutor.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.020]   Just quite often, they're not able to be in the room.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.100]   So I want them to feel
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.100]   that even if they're not there physically,
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.300]   that mentally they know exactly
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.020]   the things that we're discussing.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.620]   But I am planning to take that list,
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.740]   email it to each of my parents and say,
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.700]   "I would like to know which questions
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.060]   "you would like to prioritize for your student,"
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.820]   because it individualizes what they want to hear
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.260]   and what they want to know
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.180]   based on the conversations they've been having at home.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.060]   And so I'm hoping that that gives
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.180]   an even more well-rounded Blue Book experience
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.380]   to the students that are in my Challenge 3 class this year,
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.140]   because I want, first of all,
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.580]   parents to feel that connection to what we're discussing
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.460]   and to the ideas that we're coming across.
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.500]   But I also want the students to understand
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:14.500]   this is a partnership between me and them and their families.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.220]   And hopefully it will be able to model that relationship
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:24.060]   even to the next level for them in Blue Book assessment.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.620]   - It's a great suggestion.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.940]   It's a really good idea.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.500]   Directors, I hope you picked up on that.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.220]   It's a really good idea to be giving parents the heads up
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.740]   about the conversations
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.740]   and how they might be represented in a Blue Book exam.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.860]   That really helped.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.700]   That leads me to this question.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:46.700]   How can parents help their student prepare for Blue Books?
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:51.620]   Okay, now, as lifelong learners
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.260]   and just natural teachers, Kelly,
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.220]   I know both you and I want to say,
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.020]   how can parents help their students prepare for Blue Books
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.140]   during the semester?
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.540]   Because it's not a good paradigm
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.460]   to wait and cram right before.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.620]   So we don't want to encourage parents
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.180]   to only help right at the end.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.860]   I mean, we do want them to help at the end of the semester
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.580]   as assessment approaches.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.460]   So give us some suggestions for both times.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.780]   How can parents help their students
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.420]   prepare for Blue Book exams,
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.500]   both during the semester and then at the end
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.460]   as assessment approaches?
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.300]   Oh, okay.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.220]   So I would say during the semester,
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.660]   make sure that you are dropping off your student,
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.580]   but you're not dropping out of conversations.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:44.580]   I know it can be easy to just let your student
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.780]   become more independent and to relish that
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.980]   because that is the goal.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:54.020]   We want them to be independently thinking and learning
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.460]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.420]   However, at this point, as their guides
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.580]   who are coming alongside them,
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.460]   we need to be keeping tabs on what their thoughts are
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.380]   behind what they're thinking, what they're learning,
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.700]   what they're experiencing.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.860]   So I would recommend to parents, take time each week,
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.860]   even if your student is just the most independent student
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.020]   who can sit there and do all of their work
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.460]   without even making a peep.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.580]   We are classical conversations,
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.060]   not only for the conversations we have on community day,
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.740]   but for the conversations that those experiences produce
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.140]   within the home.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.460]   And so talk to your student about what they're learning.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.260]   And it can be something as simple as, for example,
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.620]   I know my examples are all challenge three right now.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.300]   That's the land that I'm living in this year.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   But, you know, as we're reading Patriots history,
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.020]   I will sit down with my son and I will say,
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.100]   so tell me, you know, the chapter that you read this week,
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.740]   what was one thing that surprised you?
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.260]   Or what is something that, you know,
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.780]   if you lived during that time,
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.900]   how do you think you would have felt
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.380]   about, you know, what was going on?
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.380]   Or, you know, I mean, my son right now began the year
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:15.100]   with a fear and a dread of reading the Gallic Wars.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.780]   - Yes, okay, I can understand that.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:22.340]   - And it has turned into the most fun opportunity
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.700]   for the two of us to get together and talk about Caesar
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.620]   and his plans and his military strategies.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.140]   And so I will ask my son,
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.180]   so was Caesar a good military general
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.100]   at this point in the game?
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.700]   Why or why not?
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.660]   And it has launched the best conversations.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.580]   Just asking them what they think, what they feel,
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.540]   what they have experienced,
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.860]   validates the fact that they are putting in hard work
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.060]   to take in this information and to assimilate it
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:56.180]   and to be able to articulate, you know,
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:00.580]   these really crucial, important pieces of history
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.180]   and science and math and language.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.900]   So, you know, I think one of the things
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.180]   that he looks forward to right now,
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.700]   I'll go sit in a rocking chair on our front porch
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.300]   and I'll text him and I'll say,
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.860]   "Five-minute conversation on the front porch."
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.540]   And so he'll come out and I'll ask,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.580]   he'll say, "What do you wanna know?
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.740]   "What do you wanna know?"
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.540]   And I'll ask him, you know, a question like,
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.980]   "What'd you do about nothing?
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.780]   "Would you marry someone like Beatrice?
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.140]   "Why or why not?"
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.860]   - Right, right.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.820]   - He just, you know, he will launch into way more dialect
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.660]   than I probably would expect, you know,
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.220]   any high school junior to have an opinion about Shakespeare.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.900]   But because I'm asking him a question
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.500]   that directly correlates to who he is
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.580]   and the decisions that he makes,
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.980]   he's more interested and he wants to express his opinion
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.960]   because he is becoming truly rhetorical
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.460]   in what we've exposed him to
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.500]   and to all the pieces that he's put together in his mind
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.700]   and hopefully in his soul
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.100]   that will help him to continue to pursue Christ
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.620]   for the rest of his life.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.980]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.940]   Those are some really good suggestions, Kelly.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.780]   I think it boils down to,
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.300]   I feel like in every podcast that I've done
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.900]   over the last six weeks, it's been about family learning.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.820]   The refrain, the common refrain has been,
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.260]   "Ask good questions.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.900]   "Ask your student good questions.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.380]   "Have good conversations."
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.100]   So there's a thread running through here, listeners.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.900]   Yes, we are still talking about asking good questions
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.280]   and starting good conversations
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.060]   because that is both how our students learn
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.180]   and how they retain what they've learned
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:47.020]   when we contextually, in the context of conversation,
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:52.020]   connect it to other things that they really, really enjoy
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.180]   or that are important to them.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.080]   All right, Kelly, we're almost out of time,
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.100]   but I wanna ask you,
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:04.180]   I want you to think about exams that you have taken.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.020]   - Right.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.300]   - It could be when you were a little kid
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.740]   or when you were a college student,
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.180]   or I don't know, maybe it was your driver's test.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.240]   Think about an exam you've taken.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:19.240]   What was the best learning experience a test ever gave you?
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.260]   Okay, now that might be a loaded question.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.500]   What was the best learning experience
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.300]   that a test ever gave you?
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.700]   And then what was the worst experience you had?
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.580]   Maybe it's because the test didn't teach you anything
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.820]   or didn't cement anything for you.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.260]   All right, the best learning experience
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.680]   a test ever gave you
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.380]   and the worst experience you ever had.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.720]   - Oh my goodness, Lisa,
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.260]   I'm gonna have to think for just a moment.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.100]   Let me think.
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:51.500]   The best experience, what immediately comes to mind
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.420]   is really not an exam, but kind of an assessment.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:00.340]   I was an early reader and always loved to spell.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.620]   I have always been a speller
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:06.380]   and in kindergarten, my teacher noticed that.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.800]   And so she began training me,
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.420]   sitting side by side with me,
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.620]   helping me to practice for the county spelling bee.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.740]   And I remember that I got to the spelling bee
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.020]   and oh my goodness,
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.340]   there were students from all over our county
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.740]   and it was probably my first experience
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.500]   ever standing on a platform and articulate.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.340]   - I bet so.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.300]   - But I remember, I kept seeing students get eliminated
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.500]   and I just thought, well, I felt badly for them
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.880]   because I needed them to do well.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.960]   And so at the end of this kindergarten spelling bee,
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.420]   there was one other little boy and me.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.220]   And I remember they gave him a word
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.740]   and my father still says that the moment that I realized
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.620]   he misspelled the word,
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.860]   that I got this look over my face like,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.060]   oh my goodness.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.100]   - It's like, oh my gosh, I've stolen me.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.940]   - They gave me my final word in the spelling bee
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.940]   and I was the winner of the spelling bee.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:09.780]   - Oh, yay.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.240]   - Such a good memory.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.340]   I still have the little trophy and everything.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.860]   - That's awesome.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.380]   - But it was an assessment for me
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:22.820]   of that time that the teacher had sat side by side with me.
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.700]   I prioritized rightly that we had done things well
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.140]   and praise the Lord.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.500]   That had a positive impact on me.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.500]   Now, the worst assessment probably followed the year after.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:40.480]   So I, you know, I'm resting on my laurels in first grade.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.740]   My teacher said, well, Kelly's gonna do the spelling bee
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.920]   again, she did such a great job last year.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.220]   So I thought, oh, this will be a piece of cake.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.100]   I won in kindergarten, so I did not prepare.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.420]   I did not prepare.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:59.660]   And I'm going to show up and I remember,
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.260]   talk about a humbling.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.060]   I remember when they called out,
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.140]   and this is so shameful for me to even admit,
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.820]   but I was in first grade, so you have to cut me some slack.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.820]   - Right, so you've grown a lot since then.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.040]   So there you go.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.980]   - I remember the moderator called out the word wash
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.520]   and immediately from my mouth came W-H,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.740]   just like W-H at the beginning of whale.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.060]   You know, we had been learning about the graphs
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.520]   and the sounds that they make.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.500]   And as soon as it came out, I wished I could take it back
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.020]   because I knew it was wrong.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:34.020]   But it was that one mistake that cost me everything.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.420]   And I remember I came down off the platform,
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:41.860]   ashamed and embarrassed, not that I had misspelled a word,
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.140]   but because I knew that my preparation ahead of time
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.620]   had spoiled it.
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.300]   Yes, yes.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:53.580]   And so I think the thing that I learned from that assessment
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.580]   was that we do need to take time to prepare adequately,
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.500]   to think, to reason.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.780]   And so that was the thing that I learned.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.340]   And in thinking about that,
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.380]   I think there are a lot of lessons
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.060]   for me as a homeschooling parent.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:14.220]   First of all, just like that kindergarten experience
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.580]   that was so positive.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:20.420]   If I take the time to sit next to my child
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:24.420]   and to have those conversations and to keep a gauge on
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.460]   where is their mind?
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.980]   Where are their thoughts?
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.600]   Where is their heart?
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.700]   What are their struggles?
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.100]   What are their times of rejoicing
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.620]   that they've experienced this semester?
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.980]   There will be no surprises when we get to that week 15
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.420]   and that blue book opportunity.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:46.420]   But equally, if we are like my poor little first grade self,
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:53.340]   if we do not make that time, we decide to withdraw,
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.280]   we prioritize other things
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.980]   rather than spending that time in conversation
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.460]   to prepare for assessments rightly,
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.900]   then we will not see the fruit
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.100]   that could have been produced.
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.700]   And so, CC parents who are listening to this today,
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.720]   I would say the greatest thing to take from this podcast
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.420]   is assessment is a time for you to draw near to your child,
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.540]   to be able to strengthen, comfort your child,
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.460]   be together, devote yourself to one another,
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.380]   and to make it a time of assessment and celebration
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:31.380]   and rejoicing rather than regret, which I experienced.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.740]   You know, prioritize rightly
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.780]   because you want to be able to spend that time
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.860]   in preparation for more than just the answers
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.960]   that will be written in that blue book of stapled papers.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.620]   You want to be able to keep your finger on the pulse
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.700]   of your child's spiritual growth.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.420]   How are they assimilating the books that they're reading
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.420]   and the things that they're experiencing
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.340]   into who they are, you know, as a person,
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.980]   as an eternal soul,
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.940]   because that is infinitely more important
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.020]   than, say, a Spelling Bee trophy.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.860]   - Right, right, absolutely.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:14.540]   Oh, this has just been such a sweet time, Kellie.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.260]   I really appreciate you letting me pick your brain.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.380]   I appreciate your transparency.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:25.100]   I appreciate you giving away some of your best ideas.
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.100]   Parents, I hope that this conversation
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.540]   has been a blessing to you
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:37.540]   and that it will become a blessing for your family
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.700]   as you're able to act on some of these suggestions
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.660]   as we draw near to the end of our first semester
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.020]   and a time of assessing.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.380]   I want to leave you with a question
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:55.140]   that is sort of a challenge, okay?
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.460]   How can the blue book
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:04.460]   become not the end of the semester's learning
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.720]   but a new beginning?
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:11.060]   I want you to ponder that.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.740]   As you go forth and lead your family,
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.580]   having great conversations
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.900]   by asking some really good leading questions,
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:24.500]   and as you all prepare for the assessment
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.700]   that will spur you on to greater thinking.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.580]   Kellie, thank you so much for your time.
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.100]   I really appreciate you being here with us today.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.420]   I always love to talk to you,
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.980]   and we could talk for another hour,
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.700]   but I know that we've given people a lot to think about,
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.460]   and so we'll put a pen in it for now,
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.020]   and we'll just hope to talk together again another time,
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:46.860]   okay?
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.680]   - Absolutely.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.520]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.380]   - Parents, I also want to take just one more minute
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.860]   to talk to you again about Homeschool Families on Mission.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.460]   I think I've talked to you about this before
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.460]   several months ago.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:05.100]   It's a program through the nonprofit organization,
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:08.220]   the Classical Conversations Foundation.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.820]   And through this group, Homeschool Families on Mission,
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:15.500]   the foundation supports homeschool students
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.980]   who want to participate in some short-term mission trips.
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.940]   So I wanted to give you kind of a progress report.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.780]   This year, the foundation was able to provide grants
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.300]   to 55 homeschool students
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.300]   who went on mission trips all over the world,
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.020]   South Africa, Uganda, the Czech Republic,
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.260]   Peru, and the Middle East.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.020]   Now, you can help.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.340]   If you would like to help these students,
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.820]   help these families,
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:48.620]   you can join the John 1-1 Mission Partnership Campaign
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.380]   and donate a dollar and 10 cents.
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.020]   Get it, 1-1, okay?
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.840]   And by doing that, you can help fund mission trips
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.220]   for homeschool students to spread the good news of Christ,
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.100]   to make Him known, okay?
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.060]   You can help people come to know the truth of John 1-1
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.460]   in the beginning was the Word,
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:13.060]   and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.060]   So if you want to become a mission partner

[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.860]   (gentle music)
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.920]   you
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.980]   you
