[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   Is the Christian righteous or unrighteous?
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.520]   A simplistic yes or no answer to this question is misleading because it's a tricky question
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.960]   that calls for theological care and it's a question we have received from a listener
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.960]   named Jason.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.440]   Pastor John, I have recently been listening to your old sermon, Our Hope, Righteousness.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.660]   In it, you mentioned that full and perfect righteousness lies in the future.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.940]   It is our hope, not our possession.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.360]   This is in reference to Galatians 5.5, "For through the Spirit by faith we wait for the
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.040]   hope of righteousness."
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.360]   Can you clarify for me what it means to be righteous?
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.600]   I thought it meant right standing.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.440]   In placing my faith in Jesus, does that make me righteous at the time of my profession?
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.140]   Or does righteous mean perfect?
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.960]   And that's why we're not righteous now.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.440]   Can you clarify for me the various stages of righteousness in the history of a believer?
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:13.440]   Oh, I will love to try, because this is just so close to the heart of what the Gospel is
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.600]   and who Christ is to us, and getting this distinction is right at the heart of the Gospel,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.580]   right at the heart of Reformation discoveries 500 years ago.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.580]   So here we go.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.720]   Let's try.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.640]   Even though there are particular passages about righteousness which are unclear to me,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:42.280]   frankly, as to their precise meaning, nevertheless, the overall picture, I think, in the New Testament
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.160]   is clear.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.760]   So just to keep matters as simple as possible, without distorting the reality, I would love
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:59.840]   to say there are two basic uses of the word righteousness in this regard.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:08.840]   One that is reckoned to us, counted to us, imputed to us—pick your word—reckoned
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.100]   to us through faith and which comes from God as a gift in the moment that you receive it
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.840]   by faith.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.080]   That would be because Jesus has done that righteousness.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.320]   He has performed that righteousness, and His is counted as ours.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.520]   We call that imputed righteousness.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.200]   The other use of the word would be righteousness that we ourselves are acting out, living out
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.000]   in our daily lives, and both of them—not just one of them—both of them are through
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.200]   faith, but not in the same way through faith.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:59.160]   The first is an imputed gift, counted as ours, that gift received through faith.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.920]   The second kind is an imparted gift—not an imputed gift, but an imparted gift—which
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.720]   we ourselves perform.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.560]   We ourselves perform by faith in His power.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.440]   2 Thessalonians 1:11.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.920]   So the first kind of righteousness is perfect.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.780]   The second kind of righteousness is progressive and will someday be perfected at the end of
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.760]   our lives when God completes our process of becoming practically and personally perfectly
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.160]   righteous, but which now in this life is not yet perfect.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.800]   And the relationship between these two kinds of righteousness is that we can't make any
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:58.520]   progress in practical, lived-out righteousness until we are accepted by God, forgiven for
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:07.440]   our sins, and declared to be perfectly righteous with the imputed righteousness of God in Christ.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:16.160]   That's tremendously important to see, because it means that the effort—the effort that
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:25.240]   we make by faith through the Holy Spirit to put to death sins and become more and more
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:34.360]   practically righteous—that effort is not the basis of our right standing with God,
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.160]   but the consequence or effect of our right standing with God.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160]   That's huge.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.880]   If we get those switched around, we don't live the gospel.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.140]   We don't have the gospel.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.200]   The gift of the first kind of righteousness is called justification.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.120]   We receive it by faith alone.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.520]   Romans 3:28, Romans 5:1.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.200]   This means that it happens instantaneously through our faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:12.160]   and Lord and treasure at the very instant of our first act of saving faith, which God
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.500]   gives us in the new birth.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:25.920]   At that very instant, God is then and from that moment on 100% for us and not against
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   us.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   No condemnation.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.620]   Romans 8, 1.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.400]   Even though before that we were children of wrath.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.360]   Ephesians 2, 3.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:43.320]   At that moment then, for the first time, by the Spirit through faith, we are able to kill
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:53.080]   specific sins and make progress in God-pleasing, practical, lived-out righteousness.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:01.220]   Before we had faith, we could not please God at all or perform true righteousness, because
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.880]   without faith it is impossible to please God.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.800]   Hebrews 11, 6.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.100]   But as soon as we were given faith, in that instant we were justified.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.040]   So none of the works of righteousness, none of our own works of righteousness that come
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.400]   from faith could ever be the basis of justification, because we are justified with Christ's perfect
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.160]   righteousness the very instant that we have faith before we do any works of faith.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.760]   Now if that's a complicated paragraph, stop, back it up, listen again, because I meant
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.400]   what I said and I think it's biblical.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.420]   So let's look at a few passages of Scripture to show that these things are so.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.200]   That's just what I've been saying so far is almost all theological conception is built
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.360]   on text, but here are the texts.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.760]   Let's start with imputed righteousness, the righteousness that is reckoned to us by God
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.440]   because of Christ.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.560]   Romans 5, 19.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:10.240]   As by one man's disobedience the many were appointed sinners—that's Adam—so by one
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.840]   man's obedience—that's Christ—by one man's obedience the many will be appointed
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.760]   righteous.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.960]   That's what I mean by imputed righteousness.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.720]   Or here it is from Romans 4, 6.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.400]   David speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.320]   So there's the biblical basis of the word "imputation" or "reckoning."
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.500]   He counts righteousness apart from works of the law.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.560]   Or Philippians 3, 8, and 9.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.720]   "I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that I may
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.920]   gain Christ and be found"—here are the key words—"be found in Him"—in union
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.760]   with Him, and that's the basis of it—"in union with Him, not having a righteousness
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:08.120]   of my own that comes from law, but that which comes through faith in Christ."
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.900]   The righteousness from God that depends on faith.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:19.280]   So those are at least three illustrations of righteousness that we have as a gift from
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.400]   God through faith.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.140]   None of our practical, lived-out righteousness is the basis of that gift.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:38.240]   As Paul says in Titus 3, 5, "God saved us not because of works done by us in righteousness."
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.240]   So he refers to good works of righteousness that we can actually do.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.440]   And then he says, "Those aren't the basis."
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.280]   God saved us not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.880]   own mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.300]   Now what about the practical, lived-out righteousness?
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:09.580]   That's what we do now, by the Spirit, since we have been made alive through faith by the
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.580]   Spirit.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:16.100]   Here's Romans 6, 13, "Do not present your members"—that is, your hands and your feet
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:22.400]   and your tongue, your sexual organs—"do not present your members to sin as instruments
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:30.440]   of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God"—here it is—"as those who have
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:36.360]   been brought from death to life."
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.920]   Make yourself alive by doing this.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.880]   You've been brought from death to life, and your members now present them as instruments
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.200]   of righteousness.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:54.560]   And Paul says clearly that in this life we are not yet perfect in righteousness of our
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.560]   own.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.680]   Philippians 3, 12, "Not that I have already obtained or am already perfect"—oh, that's
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:08.640]   so important for perfectionistic people—"but I press on to make it my own because Christ
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.000]   Jesus has made me His own."
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.880]   So here's the glory and the mystery of the Christian life.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:23.000]   We are already righteous in Christ, and so we have peace with God.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.260]   Romans 5, 1, "And in the peace of that acceptance with God, we strive for righteousness in our
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:41.720]   daily lives, because we know that this not only confirms that we are God's people"—2
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:50.960]   Peter 1:10—"but because this is the most deeply satisfying way to glorify Christ."

[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.900]   [END]
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   "And in the peace of that acceptance with God, we strive for righteousness in our daily
