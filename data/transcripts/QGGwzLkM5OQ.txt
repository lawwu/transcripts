[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.860]   In 2008, John Piper preached a sermon which was titled "Regeneration, Faith, Love"
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.320]   in that order.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.500]   The sermon unpacks the reality of the new birth, the place of faith, and then the role
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.200]   of obedience in the life of faith.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.700]   He eventually explains the aim and the purposes of our love for others, but he begins by talking
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.140]   about the regeneration that produces faith and the obedience to God's commandments.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.220]   Here's what John Piper said in his 2008 sermon as he ties together regeneration, faith, and
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.220]   love.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.540]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.580]   The opposite of experiencing the commandments of God as burdensome is to experience them
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.740]   as your deepest longing, your deepest delight.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.260]   And that's what the new birth does.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.560]   We're working our way, remember last time, through three links in the chain of thought
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.940]   in verses 3 and 4?
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.040]   That was link number one, but this time, in this service, I want to push on this just
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.780]   a little farther and ask, "Which commandments?"
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.300]   What's he got in mind specifically?
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.620]   Anything?
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.620]   When he says, "This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments and don't find them
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.400]   burdensome," which commandments?
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.180]   What specifically might be at the front of his mind that might help us get a handle on
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.180]   this?
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.820]   I don't think it's hard to answer that question if you just read the flow of the thoughts
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.980]   starting back in 420.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.020]   That's just two verses prior to the chapter 5.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.020]   Let's start at 420.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.620]   1 John 420 says, "If anyone says, 'I love God,'" I hope you say that, "and hates his
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.140]   brother, he's a liar.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.580]   For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.580]   seen.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.660]   This is the commandment that we have from Him.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.700]   Whoever loves God must love his brother."
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.660]   So we know what's on the front burner of this man's mind when he writes, "If you love God,
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.820]   you keep His commandments."
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.540]   It's the commandment to love each other.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.540]   That's the main commandment.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.980]   In fact, we're going to see before we're done, that's the summary of all the other commandments
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.180]   in this book and in the Bible.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.100]   So when he says, "If you love God, you keep His commandments," he means first, if you
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.340]   love God, you love other people, especially believers.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.880]   So now we have in the first link of the chain, not just a vague statement about loving God
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.840]   yields obedience.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.340]   We have a statement much more precise, and this is what I wanted.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.780]   We have a statement, "Loving God yields loving people."
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.740]   That's what we have in the first part of verse 3.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.660]   He keeps on going.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.380]   Verse 1, "Everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of Him."
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.260]   So you see the connection he's continuing?
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.980]   He's confirming that this is on his front burner.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.040]   Verse 2, second half of the verse, "By this we know that we love the children of God when
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.620]   we love God and obey His commandments."
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.260]   Now that's odd.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.980]   He switched it around on us.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.620]   Kind of surprised me anyway.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.820]   He's going along saying that loving God means loving people, and now he says, "By this we
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.060]   know that we love people."
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.020]   We love children of God, Christians, when we love God and obey His commandments.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.140]   Why does he do that?
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.580]   Why does he say not just, "You know you're loving God when you love people," but he also
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.820]   says, "You know you're loving people when you love God."
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.820]   Seems like a circle.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.820]   Where are we going to jump in?
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.300]   Here, I'll tell you why I think he did it.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.380]   You decide.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.220]   This is your Bible.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:20.540]   I think John added verse 2 like that to guard us against sentimental reinterpretations of
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.460]   what love is.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.540]   Nobody is going to say, "I don't think we should love other people."
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.780]   Nobody is going to say that.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.660]   But they may mean something very sentimental by it.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.340]   No grounding in reality.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.460]   Not doing anybody any ultimate good.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.220]   Just doing what they think love is.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.020]   And John wants to guard against that.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.220]   And so he says, "By this we know that we love the children of God."
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.780]   Not when we do any old thing we feel like toward them, but when we love God.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.060]   You can't help anybody if you don't love God.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.140]   Well, if you believe that.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.540]   Well, of course you don't believe that.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.960]   You can feed them if you don't love God.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.780]   You can clothe them if you don't love God.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.480]   You can give a roof over their heads if you don't love God.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.220]   You can help them get assimilated as a refugee if you don't love God.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.660]   Of course you can do good to people if you don't love God.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.700]   You can just make them totally comfortable on their way to hell.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.380]   God is not impressed with that kind of love.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.420]   Just doing stuff for people, distracting them from their totally big need.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.060]   Never angling all those food and clothing and shelter and help.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.820]   That's them when they wake up to what they need.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.980]   Not caring about that.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.580]   Just doing what you think love is.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.980]   This verse is in there to keep us from doing that,
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.780]   because one of the commands of God that validate whether you're loving people is,
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.820]   "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart."
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.660]   And if you're not helping people do that, you're not loving them.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.220]   You can call it what you like, but biblically speaking, you're not loving them.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.180]   If you're not using all the practical helps,
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.820]   which almost certainly should be done with a view to awakening their heart
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.540]   to see God as their treasure and their Savior, you're not loving them.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.500]   That's such a key thing to keep in mind is we seek to be kind and to love our neighbors.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.100]   We don't love simply because we have a design on their lives,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.340]   but we do serve in love toward an ultimate end in mind,
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.820]   and it's healthy to be convicted about that end.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.380]   The clip was taken from a sermon John Piper preached on March 2nd, 2008,
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.500]   titled "Regeneration, Faith, Love," in that order.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.020]   This clip was sent in by Christopher Burdine in Oklahoma City.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.580]   Christopher, thank you for this clip.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.940]   So many of you are sending us some great clips from the Piper Sermon Archive,
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.940]   and I appreciate that.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.500]   Please keep them coming.

[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:23.220]   Well Pastor John returns tomorrow to address an unmarried couple who has committed sexual sin,
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.100]   and they're asking, "What should we do now?"
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.100]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.820]   I'll see you then.
