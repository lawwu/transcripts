[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - We got ourselves some questions here.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.520]   First one comes from Agnes McGyver, awesome name.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.560]   McGyver, do you watch McGyver?
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.040]   We're the generation.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.960]   - I've seen it in the past, yeah, for sure.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.520]   - Guy was awesome.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.000]   So Agnes McGyver, which is I believe McGyver's aunt.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.560]   I just said the name, like the aunt
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.440]   that sends him a birthday card.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.160]   All right, Agnes McGyver says,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.440]   I've been applying deep work concepts and time blocking
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.800]   to both my personal and professional life.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440]   I'm ambitious in both.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.520]   Do you recommend creating a clearly defined separation
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.360]   between the two?
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.640]   Do I use two time block planners?
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.640]   I catch myself wanting to open a time block planner
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   and plan out my personal life.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.800]   Agnes, I usually recommend do not fully time block
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.560]   your personal life if you're also time blocking
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.200]   your professional life because it's too much structure.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.560]   You will eventually burn out.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.240]   Time blocking is very artificial.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.360]   All right, so when you're time blocking,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.880]   it's not like you are rolling with our natural instincts
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.720]   of humans about how we approach our time.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.520]   It is an artificial solution to the artificial load
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.320]   of diverse work tasks that we get poured on our plate.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.200]   So it's not easy to do, but it works.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.360]   It gets a lot done.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.520]   It keeps things in control.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.960]   It allows us to survive the deluge of tasks
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.040]   that's thrown at us in the modern work situation.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.160]   In a perfect, slow productivity enriched world,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.800]   you might not need time blocking at all,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.000]   but we need it today.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.920]   But you don't wanna do something so difficult
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.760]   and so unnatural in every waking hour
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.080]   you are gonna burn out.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.480]   So go lighter in your personal time.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.760]   I often just recommend sketching a plan.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.040]   End of the day, it's the evening.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.400]   What's going on?
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.160]   Well, is there any time specific things
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.000]   we need to remember?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.840]   Let me jot that down.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.880]   We're going to dinner.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.160]   I have to pick something up from the store.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.440]   And then you sketch out other things you wanna get done.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.480]   Here's my plan for tonight.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.720]   I wanna get some reading in later.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.400]   I wanna watch this show.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.920]   You kind of figure out a reasonable plan.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.840]   You kind of jot it down.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.760]   It's not planning out every minute.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.000]   Here's the things that have to happen.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.160]   Here's some things I wanna get done.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.200]   Rough plan, do your best.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.480]   Same thing for weekends.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.320]   Well, I'm gonna go,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.200]   we're going on this trip for most of Saturday,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.040]   but I wanna get a walk in before.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.480]   You're just sketching out a plan.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.440]   So it's not a full-time block plan,
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.720]   but it's not just winging it.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.920]   It's somewhere in between.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.000]   I think that's probably the right balance between the two.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.600]   (upbeat music)
