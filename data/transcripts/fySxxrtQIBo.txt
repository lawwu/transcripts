[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   Pastor John, you recently tweeted Joshua 424 which reads, "He dried up the Jordan that
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.160]   all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty."
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.760]   And then you added the word "missions" to the tweet.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.520]   How does Joshua 424 relate to global missions?
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.960]   Well, I'm glad for the question because I love to talk about this.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.480]   Let me read the text that I was quoting.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.640]   This is Joshua 423-24.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.840]   For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.480]   as the Lord your God did the Red Sea.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   So you get the splitting of the Jordan and the splitting of the Red Sea as one big, great,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.520]   miraculous way God is dealing with his people.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.720]   Which he dried up for us until we passed over so that...
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.840]   Now here's the purpose clause.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.760]   Why did God split the Red Sea?
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.000]   Why did God split the Jordan in such a stunning and miraculous way?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.920]   So that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.680]   That you may fear the Lord your God forever.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.940]   So what that text says is one of God's purposes in the Exodus and in the entrance into the
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:33.320]   land with a stretching forth of his mighty arm in dividing the seas was so that the news
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.400]   would spread everywhere among all the nations.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.760]   Yahweh, the God of Israel, is supremely mighty.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.560]   Now that's what I mean by missions.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.640]   We read in Psalm 96, "Declare his glory among the nations."
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.000]   That becomes the theme of many missions conferences.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.360]   Well here it is.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.560]   God is declaring his glory among the nations.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.320]   God is a missionary God.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   And so what I would do to expand it and explain it would be to say, "From the very beginning
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.600]   when man fell and God inaugurated a plan of redemption, God had the nations in view."
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.880]   Even when he chose Israel to focus on for 2,000 years, he had the nations in view because
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.400]   he said to Abraham, "I'll make you a great nation and in you all the families of the
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.640]   earth will be blessed."
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.080]   Genesis 12.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.680]   So when he chose Israel and began to do his mighty works in and for Israel, he was doing
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.080]   them always on the stage of the world with a view that the nations would see his glory.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:58.000]   So if you go back to Exodus 14 where they're coming out of Egypt, he says in chapter 14,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.780]   verse 4, "I will harden Pharaoh's heart and he will pursue them and I will get glory over
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.600]   Pharaoh and all his hosts and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord."
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.040]   Now here's the question.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.040]   When he did that, when he put his glory on display for the Egyptians, is that the only
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.880]   thing he had in mind?
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.360]   Or did he have also in mind that this news is going to spread everywhere and people are
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.440]   going to know Yahweh is the true God and some of them by grace may turn to the true God
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.160]   and be saved and that's what missions would be.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.000]   And what I had in the back of my mind when I wrote that tweet was Rahab.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.920]   Probably nobody knew that's what's in my mind, but Hebrews 11, 13 says, "By faith Rahab,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.080]   the prostitute," she's in Jericho about to be destroyed as they cross the Jordan there,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.940]   "By faith she did not perish with those who were disobedient because she had given a friendly
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.000]   welcome to the spies."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   That's Hebrews 11, 31.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.720]   Now my question is, why did she do that?
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.280]   Why did she do that?
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   And here's the answer, Joshua 2, 9.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:29.760]   "Rahab said to the men, 'I know that Yahweh has given you the land and that the fear of
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.200]   you has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land melt before you.'"
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.000]   How did she know that?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.880]   Verse 10, "For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.960]   when you came out of Egypt and what you did to the kings of the Amorites, to Sihon and
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.160]   Og whom you devoted to destruction."
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:02.080]   So God had Rahab's salvation in mind when he split the Red Sea.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.640]   That's what I mean.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:12.840]   When I say that God's exaltation of his own glory in the salvation of his people is a
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.040]   missionary act, I mean the reputation that he's going to get from this is going to lead
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:27.640]   people like Rahab to humble themselves before Yahweh, stop putting up their rebellion against
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.280]   the true God, and embrace him and be saved.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.480]   So when I said, the tweet said, "Mission's period, he dried up the Jordan that all the
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.440]   peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty," that's what I meant.
