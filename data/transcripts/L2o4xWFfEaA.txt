[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Alex, a young woman, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.600]   Pastor John, is sexual attraction
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.520]   at the beginning of a relationship essential for marriage?
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.520]   Should you court someone you are not sexually attracted to?
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.400]   I'm currently praying about the possibility
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.440]   of courting a man who is on fire for the Lord
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.400]   and who pushes me to be a better woman for Jesus,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.240]   but I'm not sexually attracted to him,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.180]   although I am emotionally.
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.680]   What should I do?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.060]   I was so perplexed and moved by this question,
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.880]   I talked to my wife about it.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.180]   So, this is a little bit of overflow from our conversation
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.220]   'cause I'm not sure I can get inside
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.140]   the skin of women very easily.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.540]   So I wanted to check with a woman.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.840]   At one level, this is easy to answer,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.180]   and at another level, not so easy.
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.260]   The key word that makes it easy is the word essential.
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.600]   She says, is sexual attraction
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.200]   at the beginning of a relationship,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.620]   I would say any time in the relationship,
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.120]   essential for marriage?
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.160]   And the word essential means of the essence.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.520]   Does sexual attraction belong to the essence of marriage?
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.240]   And the answer is no,
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.520]   it does not belong to the essence of marriage.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.480]   Now be careful, I didn't say sexual relations,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.040]   I said sexual pleasure.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.600]   Sexual attraction doesn't belong to the essence of marriage.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.820]   The essence of marriage is the making and keeping
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.860]   of a covenant between a man and a woman
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.200]   to be husband and wife to each other
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.040]   as long as they both shall live.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.000]   That's the essence of a marriage,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.700]   covenant making, covenant keeping,
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.320]   to be a husband and a wife.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.560]   And to be sure, that covenant includes the promise
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   to give oneself to the other in sexual relations.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.000]   First Corinthians 7, three,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.040]   the husband should give his wife her conjugal rights
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.240]   and likewise the wife, her husband.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.740]   But there is nothing in the Bible
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.720]   that mandates any particular degree of physical pleasure
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.440]   in that relationship.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.400]   And there are two other reasons for this view,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.840]   why I don't think sexual attraction
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.920]   or sexual pleasure is of the essence.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.400]   One is cultural.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.080]   Throughout most of history, I think,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.200]   and in most cultures, marriages have been arranged
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.360]   by parents.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.400]   Couples did not look around
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.600]   to see who made them sexually aroused.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.760]   They accepted the cultural pattern.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.740]   And this means that most marriages in history
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.500]   have not started based on a sense of sexual attraction.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.000]   That had to come later if it came at all.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.400]   And those were real essential marriages.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.880]   And the other reason for saying this
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   is that marriage has seasons of life
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   as you grow older together.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.500]   So we've been married 45 years.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.360]   We've walked through some of these seasons.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.760]   We're still doing it.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.440]   And this issue of physical pleasuring
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.520]   of each other rises and falls.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.000]   I mean, it can rise and fall when you're young
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.280]   because of all kinds of issues that come and go in life
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.600]   with broken children or strained relationships.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.480]   And if you said that sexual attraction were of the essence,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.160]   then aging would be the gradual end of marriage
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   when in fact, the glories of marriage
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.480]   may increase with aging
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.180]   and with the waning of sexual pleasure.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.520]   So my answer to the question is just to flat out no.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.800]   Sexual attraction is not essential for marriage.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.080]   Now that's the easy part of the answer.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.280]   Here's what makes it not easy
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.560]   is I'm not sure what to counsel this woman.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.880]   I don't wanna say this is unimportant here.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.280]   She says she is not sexually attracted to him,
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.120]   but she is emotionally attracted to him.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.880]   That's what I had to check with my wife about
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.120]   'cause that's hard for me to get a handle on.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.440]   Now, I admit it is hard for me as a man
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   to get inside her skin and know what that's like.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.680]   A man may be sexually attracted minus emotion.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.080]   He can be very animal-like in his sense, in the sense,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.160]   but for women generally, they're more whole,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.280]   more integrated.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.440]   Their emotions are much more closely connected
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.280]   to their sexual pleasures.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.880]   And I think that's a beautiful thing, a good thing,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.320]   and a very, very good thing for men to realize
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.680]   and own up to and adapt to.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.260]   It means that a man should never treat a woman
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.880]   as a mere source of titillation.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.200]   He should seek to know her and engage her personally
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.760]   and emotionally so that her experience of sex
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.920]   is person to person, eye to eye, heart to heart,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.760]   not just body to body.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.080]   So that's what I would say to her.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.720]   Can you see yourself gladly yielding
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.980]   to this emotional intimacy to your husband's desires
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.680]   for physical intimacy so that it becomes part
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.040]   of the emotional intimacy?
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.360]   I think right there's the issue for her,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.320]   an extension of it.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.720]   Can this emotional intimacy she has,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.720]   can she see it blending into a happy, glad,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.420]   satisfied yielding to her husband's physical intimacy,
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.640]   even if that moment she may not be having
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.520]   the same sensations that he has?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.520]   If that seems unpleasurable to you, Alex,
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.300]   or even painful or unpleasant to you,
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.900]   this could be a serious problem and cause you to hesitate.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.540]   I married a couple one time.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.500]   This is a sad story.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   The marriage did not last because I failed to see
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.300]   that this woman really hated the thought of sex.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.260]   She's got all kinds of reasons, I discovered later, for why,
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.500]   but she hoped marriage would fix it.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.560]   She despised it.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.200]   She thought it was dirty and therefore it was over.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.620]   I mean, she would not have any sexual relations
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.640]   with this guy, and he walked away from her.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.200]   So I would say to this woman, test yourself.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.480]   Sexual pleasure is not essential to marriage,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.840]   but the absence of the desire for it at the beginning
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.640]   could signal deeper problems of distaste for sex
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.680]   or resistance to the male desire,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.400]   and I would try to see that changed before moving ahead.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.620]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.980]   And we talked about what it means to be
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.680]   in a marriage covenant back in episode number 165.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.160]   It's an episode we titled,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.680]   Is My Husband's Porn Addiction a Marriage Deal Breaker?
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.200]   Be sure to check that out, episode number 165.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.560]   Well, Bible memorization is important and it's hard work.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.520]   It takes time, willpower, concentration,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.320]   and that means we need really good motivations
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.840]   for doing it in the first place.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.760]   And tomorrow, Pastor John will do that very thing.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.640]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.240]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
