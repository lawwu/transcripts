[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The following is a conversation with Jordan Peterson, his second time on this, the Lex
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   Friedman podcast.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.000]   You have given a set of lectures on Nietzsche as part of the new Peterson Academy, and the
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.040]   lectures were powerful.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.640]   There's some element of the contradictions, the tensions, the drama, the way you like
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.960]   lock in on an idea, but then are struggling with that idea, all of that, that feels like
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   it's a Nietzschean.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.920]   Yeah, well, he's a big influence on me stylistically, and like in terms of the way I approach writing,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.000]   and also many of the people that were other influences of mine were very influenced by
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   him.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.880]   So I was blown away when I first came across his writings.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:54.200]   They're so intellectually dense that I don't know if there's anything that approximates
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200]   that.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.240]   Dostoyevsky, maybe, although he's much more wordy, Nietzsche is very succinct, partly
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.360]   because he was so ill, because he would think all day, he couldn't spend a lot of time writing,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.560]   and he condenses writings into very short, while this aphoristic style he had, and it's
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.980]   really something to strive for.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.320]   And then he's also an exciting writer, like Dostoyevsky, and dynamic and romantic in that
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.360]   emotional way, and so it's really something.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.480]   And I really enjoyed doing that, I did that lecture that you described, that lecture series
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.240]   is on the first half of Beyond Good and Evil, which is a stunning book, and that was really
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.840]   fun to take pieces of it and then to describe what they mean and how they've echoed across
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.880]   the decades since he wrote them, and yeah, it's been great.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.360]   Taking each sentence seriously, and deconstructing it, and really struggling with it.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.960]   I think underpinning that approach to writing requires deep respect for the person.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.720]   I think if we approach writing with that kind of respect, you can take Orwell, you can take
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.440]   a lot of writers, and really dig in on singular sentences.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.240]   Yeah, well those are the great writers, because the greatest writers, virtually everything
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.120]   they wrote is worth attending to.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.600]   And I think Nietzsche is, in some ways, the ultimate exemplar of that, because often when
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.100]   I read a book, I'll mark one way or another, I often fold the corner of the page over to
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.680]   indicate something that I've found that's worth remembering, I couldn't do that with
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.100]   a book like Beyond Good and Evil, because every page ends up marked.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.280]   And that's in marked contrast, so to speak, to many of the books I read now, where it's
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.560]   quite frequently now that I'll read a book, and there won't be an idea in it that I haven't
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.360]   come across before, and with a thinker like Nietzsche, that's just not the case at the
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.400]   sentence level, and I don't think there's anyone that I know of who did that to a greater
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.180]   extent than he did.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.880]   So there's other people whose thought is of equivalent value.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.840]   I've returned recently, and I'm going to do a course on the work of this Romanian historian
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.520]   of religions, Mircea Eliade, who's not nearly as well known as he should be, and whose work,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.480]   by the way, is a real antidote to the post-modern, nihilistic, Marxist stream of literary interpretation
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.760]   that the universities as a whole have adopted.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.320]   And Eliade is like that, too.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.680]   I used this book called The Sacred and the Profane quite extensively in a book that I'm
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.080]   releasing in mid-November, We Who Wrestle with God, and it's of the same sort.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.400]   It's endlessly analyzable.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.280]   I mean, Eliade walked through the whole history of religious ideas, and he had the intellect
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.400]   that enabled him to do that, and everything he wrote is dream-like in its density.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:56.720]   So every sentence or paragraph is evocative in an image-rich manner, and that also, what
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.160]   would you say, deepens and broadens the scope, and that's part of often what distinguishes
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.080]   writing that has a literary end from writing that's more merely technical.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.340]   Like the literary writings have this imagistic and dream-like reference space around them,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.240]   and it takes a long time to turn a complex image into something semantic.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:25.580]   And so if your writing evokes deep imagery, it has a depth that can't be captured merely
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.580]   in words.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.980]   One of the great romantic, poetic philosophers, Nietzsche is a very good example, Dostoevsky
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.740]   is a good example, so is Mircea Eliade, they have that quality.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.460]   And it's a good way of thinking about it, you know, it's kind of interesting from the
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.980]   perspective of technical analysis of intelligence.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.040]   There's a good book called The User Illusion, which is the best book on consciousness that
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.320]   I ever read.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.100]   It explains the manner in which our communication is understandable in this manner.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.820]   So imagine that when you're communicating something, you're trying to change the way
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.820]   that your target audience perceives and acts in the world.
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.140]   So that's an embodied issue.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.220]   But you're using words, which obviously aren't equivalent to the actions themselves.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.100]   You can imagine that the words are surrounded by a cloud of images that they evoke, and
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.740]   that the images can be translated into actions.
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.820]   And the greatest writing uses words in a manner that evokes images that profoundly affects
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.660]   perception and action.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.660]   And that's the...
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.740]   So I would take the manner in which I act and behave, I would translate that into a
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.740]   set of images.
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.740]   My dreams do that for me, for example.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.420]   Then I compress them into words, I toss you the words, you decompose them, decompress
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.680]   them into the images, and then into the actions, and that's what happens in a meaningful conversation.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.940]   It's a very good way of understanding how we communicate linguistically.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:59.060]   So if the words spring to the full visual complexity, then that can then transform itself
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.060]   into action.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.940]   Yes, and change in perception.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.940]   Change in perception, yeah.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.620]   Well, those are both relevant, and it's an important thing to understand because the
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.620]   classic empiricists make the presumption, and it's an erroneous presumption, that perception
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.660]   is a value-free enterprise.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.360]   And they assume that partly because they think of perception as something passive.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.800]   You know, you just turn your head and you look at the world, and there it is.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.240]   It's like, perception is not passive.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.440]   There is no perception without action, ever, ever.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.720]   And that's a weird thing to understand, because even when you're looking at something, like,
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.080]   your eyes are moving back and forth.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.200]   If they ever stop moving for a tenth of a second, you stop being able to see.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.560]   So your eyes are jiggling back and forth just to keep them active.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.400]   And then there's involuntary movements of your eyes, and then there's voluntary movements
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   of your eyes.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.040]   And what you're doing with your eyes is very much like what a blind person would do if
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.160]   they were feeling out the contours of an object.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.500]   You're sampling.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.680]   And you're only sampling a small element of the space that's in front of you, and the
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.060]   element that you choose to sample is dependent on your aims and your goals, so it's value-saturated.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.600]   And so, all your perceptions are action-predicated, and partly what you're doing when you're communicating
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.040]   is therefore not only changing people's actions, let's say, but you're also changing the strategy
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.060]   that they use to perceive.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.160]   And so you change the way the world reveals itself for them.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.700]   See, this is why it's such a profound experience to read a particularly deep thinker, because
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.360]   you could also think of your perceptions as the axioms of your thought.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.720]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.160]   A perception is like a, what would you say, it's a thought that's so set in concrete that
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.120]   you now see it rather than conceptualize it.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.900]   A really profound thinker changes the way you perceive the world.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.960]   That's way deeper than just how you think about it or how you feel about it.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.760]   What about not just profound thinkers, but thinkers that deliver a powerful idea?
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:04.140]   For example, utopian ideas of Marx, or utopian ideas, you could say dystopian ideas of Hitler.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:12.700]   Those ideas are powerful and they can saturate all your perception with values and they focus
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.580]   you in a way where there's only a certain set of actions.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.060]   Yeah, right, even a certain set of emotions as well.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.860]   And it's intense and it's direct and they're so powerful that they completely alter the
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.180]   perception and the words spring to life.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.520]   Yeah, it's like a form of possession.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.800]   So there's two things you need to understand to make that clear.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:42.060]   The first issue is that, as we suggested or implied, that perception is action predicated,
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.860]   but action is goal predicated, right?
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.780]   You act towards a goal.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:52.900]   And these propagandistic thinkers that you described, they attempt to unify all possible
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.180]   goals into a coherent singularity.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.540]   And there's advantages of that.
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.660]   There's the advantage of simplicity, for example, which is a major advantage.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.480]   And there's also the advantage of motivation, right?
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.940]   So if you provide people with a simple manner of integrating all their actions, you decrease
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.780]   their anxiety and you increase their motivation.
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.780]   And that can be a good thing if the unifying idea that you put forward is valid.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:23.600]   But it's the worst of all possible ideas if you put forward an invalid unifying idea.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.300]   And then you might say, well, how do you distinguish between a valid unifying idea and an invalid
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   unifying idea?
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.820]   And Nietzsche was very interested in that.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.220]   And I don't think he got that exactly right.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.940]   But the postmodernists, for example, especially the ones—and this is most of them with a
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.540]   neo-Marxist bent—their presumption is that the fundamental unifying idea is power.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.320]   That everything's about compulsion and force, essentially.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:53.140]   And that that's the only true unifying ethos of mankind, which is—I don't know if there's
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.660]   a worse idea than that.
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.500]   I mean, there are ideas that are potentially as dangerous.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.260]   The nihilistic idea is pretty dangerous, although it's more of a disintegrating notion than
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.760]   a unifying idea.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.820]   The hedonistic idea that you live for pleasure, for example, that's also very dangerous.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.220]   But if you wanted to go for sheer pathology, the notion that—and this is Foucault in
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.580]   a nutshell, and Marx for that matter—that power rules everything, not only is that a
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.660]   terrible unifying idea, but it fully justifies your own use of power.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.540]   And I don't mean the power Nietzsche talks about.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:35.940]   His will to power was more his insistence that a human being is an expression of will
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.540]   rather than a mechanism of self-protection and security.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.460]   He thought of the life force in human beings as something that strived not to protect itself,
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.980]   but to exhaust itself in being and becoming.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.480]   It's like an upward-oriented motivational drive, even towards meaning.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.640]   Now he called it the will to power, and that had some unfortunate consequences, at least
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.340]   that's how it's translated.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.300]   But he didn't mean the power motivation that people like Foucault or Marx became so hung
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   up on.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.260]   So it's not power like you're trying to destroy the other.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:15.500]   It's powerful flourishing of a human being, the creative force of a human being, in that
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   way.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.020]   And you should.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:23.500]   You could imagine that you could segregate competence and ability.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.280]   Imagine that you and I were going to work on a project.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:32.140]   We could organize our project in relationship to the ambition that we wanted to attain,
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.760]   and we can organize an agreement so that you were committed to the project voluntarily,
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.540]   and so that I was committed to the project voluntarily.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:45.100]   So that means that we would actually be united in our perceptions and our actions by the
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.580]   motivation of something approximating voluntary play.
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:53.740]   Now you could also imagine another situation where I said, here's our goal, and you better
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.700]   help me or I'm going to kill your family.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:06.220]   Well the probability is that you would be quite motivated to undertake my bidding.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.740]   And so then you might say, well that's how the world works, it's power and compulsion.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:16.100]   But the truth of the matter is that you can force people to see things your way, let's
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:22.300]   say, but it's nowhere near as good a strategy, even practically, than the strategy that would
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:29.900]   be associated with something like voluntary joint agreement of pattern of movement strategy
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.900]   towards a goal.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:37.260]   See, this is such an important thing to understand, because it helps you start to understand the
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.940]   distinction between a unifying force that's based on power and compulsion, and one that
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.860]   is much more in keeping, I would say, with the ethos that governs Western societies,
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.860]   free Western societies.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:54.740]   There's really a qualitative difference, and it's not some morally relativistic illusion.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:01.900]   So if we just look at the nuance of Nietzsche's thought, the idea he first introduced and
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:08.280]   thus spoke Zarathustra of the Übermensch, it's another one that's very easy to misinterpret
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.220]   because it sounds awfully a lot like it's about power.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:20.260]   For example, in the 20th century it was misrepresented and co-opted by Hitler to advocate for the
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.540]   extermination of the inferior non-Aryan races.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.140]   And the dominion of the superior Aryans, yeah.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.940]   Well, and that was partly because Nietzsche's work also was misrepresented by his sister
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.940]   after his death.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.380]   But I also think that there's a fundamental flaw in that Nietzschean conceptualization.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:44.300]   So Nietzsche, of course, famously announced the death of God, but he did that in a manner
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.260]   that was accompanied by dire warnings, like Nietzsche said, because people tend to think
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.100]   of that as a triumphalist statement.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:58.980]   But Nietzsche actually said that, he really said something like the unifying ethos under
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.220]   which we've organized ourselves psychologically and socially has now been fatally undermined
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:09.820]   by, well, by the rationalist proclivity, by the empiricist proclivity.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.060]   There's a variety of reasons.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.380]   Mostly it was conflict between the Enlightenment view, let's say, and the classic religious
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.140]   view, and that there will be dire consequences for that.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:25.380]   And Nietzsche knew, like Dostoevsky knew, that, see, there's a proclivity for the human
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.460]   psyche and for human societies to move towards something approximating a unity, because the
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.100]   cost of disunity is high.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.460]   Fractionation of your goals, so that means you're less motivated to move forward than
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.740]   you might be, because there's many things competing for your attention.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.900]   And also anxiety, because anxiety actually signals something like goal conflict.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.740]   So there's an inescapable proclivity of value systems to unite.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.440]   Now if you kill the thing that's uniting them, that's the death of God, they either
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:01.940]   fractionate and you get confusion, anxiety, and hopelessness, or you get social disunity,
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:10.380]   or and you get social disunity, or something else arises out of the abyss to constitute
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.460]   that unifying force.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.260]   And Nietzsche said, specifically, that he believed that one of those manifestations
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.700]   would be that of communism.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.260]   And that that would kill, he said this in Will to Power, that that would kill tens of
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.820]   millions of people in the upcoming 20th century.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.860]   He could see that coming 50 years earlier, and Dostoevsky did the same thing in his book
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.060]   The Demons.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.220]   So this is the thing that the areligious have to contend with.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:44.620]   It's a real conundrum, because, I mean, you could dispute the idea that our value systems
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.500]   tend towards a unity, and society does as well, because otherwise we're disunified.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.580]   But the cost of that disunity, as I said, is goal confusion, anxiety, and hopelessness.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.780]   So it's like a real cost.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.500]   So you could dispense with the notion of unity altogether, and the postmodernists did that
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.660]   to some degree.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.500]   But they pulled off a sleight of hand too, where they replaced it by power.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:11.220]   Now Nietzsche did, he's responsible for that to some degree, because Nietzsche said, with
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.580]   his conception of the overman, let's say, is that human beings would have to create
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.580]   their own values.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:23.380]   Because the value structure that had descended from on high was now shunted aside.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.700]   But there's a major problem with that, many major problems.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.660]   The psychoanalysts were the first people who really figured this out after Nietzsche.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:39.540]   Because imagine that we don't have a relationship with the transcendental anymore that orients
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.540]   us.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.700]   Okay, now we have to turn to ourselves.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:48.820]   Okay, now if we were a unity, a clear unity within ourselves, let's say, then we could
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.080]   turn to ourselves for that discovery.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:57.140]   But if we're a fractionated plurality internally, then when we turn to ourselves, we turn to
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.580]   a fractionated plurality.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.180]   Well that was Freud's observation, it's like, well how can you make your own values
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.680]   when you're not the master in your own house?
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.340]   Like you're a war of competing motivations, or maybe you're someone who's dominated
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.860]   by the will to force and compulsion.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.340]   And so why do you think that you can rely on yourself as the source of values?
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.620]   And why do you think you're wise enough to consult with yourself to find out what those
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.700]   values are, or what they should be, say, in the course of a single life?
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:31.000]   I mean, you know, it's difficult to organize your own personal relationship, like one relationship,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.820]   in the course of your life, let alone to try to imagine that out of whole cloth you could
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.940]   construct an ethos that would be psychologically and socially stabilizing, and last over the
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.500]   long run.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.580]   And of course Marx, people like that, the people who reduce human motivation to a single
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.180]   axis, they had the intellectual hubris to imagine that they could do that.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.420]   Postmodernists are a good example of that as well.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.420]   Okay.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:06.620]   But if we lay on the table, religion, communism, Nazism, they are all unifying ethos.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.620]   They're unifying ideas, but they're also horribly dividing ideas.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.420]   They both unify and divide.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:21.660]   Religion has also divided people, because in the nuances of how the different peoples
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.300]   wrestle with God, they have come to different conclusions, and then they use those conclusions,
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:31.780]   and perhaps the people in power use those conclusions to then start wars, to start hatred,
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.780]   to divide.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:40.020]   Yeah, well it's one of the key sub-themes in the Gospels, is the sub-theme of the Pharisees.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:46.180]   And so the fundamental enemies of Christ in the Gospels are the Pharisees, and the scribes,
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.280]   and the lawyers.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.700]   So what does that mean?
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.660]   The Pharisees are religious hypocrites.
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.620]   The scribes are academics who worship their own intellect.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.220]   And the lawyers are the legal minds who use the law as a weapon.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:04.060]   And so they're the enemy of the Redeemer.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.100]   That's a sub-plot in the Gospel stories.
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.820]   And that actually all means something.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:16.620]   The Pharisaic problem is that the best of all possible ideas can be used by the worst
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.900]   actors in the worst possible way.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.780]   And maybe this is an existential conundrum, is that the most evil people use the best
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.740]   possible ideas to the worst possible ends.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.700]   And then you have the conundrum of how do you separate out, let's say, the genuine religious
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.820]   people from those who use the religious enterprise only for their own machinations.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.200]   We're seeing this happen online.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.780]   Like one of the things that you're seeing happening online, I'm sure you've noticed
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:50.700]   this, especially on the right-wing psychopathic troll side of the distribution, is the weaponization
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.500]   of a certain form of Christian ideation.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.500]   And that's often marked, at least online, by the presence of, what would you say, cliches
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.940]   like "Christ is King," which has a certain religious meaning but a completely different
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.860]   meaning in this sphere of emerging right-wing pathology.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.020]   Right wing.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.800]   The political dimension isn't the right dimension of analysis.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.220]   But it's definitely the case that the best possible ideas can be used for the worst possible
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.440]   purposes.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.060]   And that also brings up another specter, which is like, well, is there any reliable and valid
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:28.620]   way of distinguishing truly beneficial, unifying ideas from those that are pathological?
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.900]   And so, that's another thing that I tried to detail out in these lectures, but also
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.900]   in this new book.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.380]   It's like, how do you tell the good actors from the bad actors at the most fundamental
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.380]   level of analysis?
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.160]   And good ideas from the bad ideas, and you lecture on truth that Nietzsche also struggled
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   with.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:53.720]   So, how do you know that communism is a bad idea, versus it's a good idea implemented
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.160]   by bad actors?
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.520]   Right, right.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.420]   That's a more subtle variant of the religious problem, and that's what the communists say
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.420]   all the time.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.420]   The modern-day communists.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.040]   Like, real communism has never been tried.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.840]   And you could say, I suppose, with some justification, you could say that real Christianity has never
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.340]   been tried, because we always fall short of the ideal mark.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:22.340]   And so, I mean, my rejoinder to the communists is something like, every single time it's
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:27.380]   been implemented, wherever it's been implemented, regardless of the culture and the background
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:32.300]   of the people who've implemented it, it's had exactly the same catastrophic consequences.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:38.860]   Like, I don't know how many examples you need of that, but I believe we've generated sufficient
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.380]   examples so that that case is basically resolved.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:49.620]   Now, the general rejoinder to that is, it's really something like, well, if I was in charge
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.300]   of the communist enterprise, the utopia would have come about, right?
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.140]   But that's also a form of dangerous pretense.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.500]   Part of the way—see, that problem is actually resolved to some degree in the notion of—in
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.220]   the developing notion of sacrifice that emerges in the Western canon over thousands and thousands
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.220]   of years.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.000]   So, one of the suggestions, for example—and this is something exemplified in the passion
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.140]   story—is that you can tell the valid holder of an idea, because that holder will take
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:24.580]   the responsibility for the consequences of his idea onto himself.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:30.300]   And that's why, for example, you see one way of conceptualizing Christ in the gospel story
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.020]   is as the ultimate sacrifice to God.
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.420]   So you might ask, well, what's the ultimate sacrifice?
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.580]   And there are variants of an answer to that.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.820]   One form of ultimate sacrifice is the sacrifice of a child—the offering of a child—and
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.460]   the other is the offering of the self.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.260]   And the story of Christ brings both of those together, because he's the son of God that's
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:57.620]   offered to God, and so it's an archetypal resolution of that tension between ultimate
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.620]   sacrifice.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:06.060]   Ultimate because, once you're a parent, most parents would rather sacrifice themselves
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.700]   than their children, right?
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.100]   So you have something that becomes of even more value than yourself.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.220]   But the sacrifice of self is also a very high-order level of sacrifice.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.820]   Christ is an archetype of the pattern of being that's predicated on the decision to take,
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.060]   to offer everything up to the highest value, right?
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.620]   That pattern of self-sacrifice.
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:33.020]   And I think part of the reason that's valid is because the person who undertakes to do
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.520]   that pays the price themselves.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520]   It's not externalized.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   They're not trying to change anyone else, except maybe by example.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.140]   It's your problem.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:47.460]   Like Solzhenitsyn pointed that out, too, when he was struggling with the idea of good versus
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.580]   evil.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.220]   And you see this in more sophisticated literature.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:58.140]   You know, in really unsophisticated literature or drama, there's a good guy and a bad guy,
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:03.060]   and the good guy's all good, and the bad guy's all bad.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:10.060]   And in more sophisticated literature, the good and bad are abstracted.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.140]   You can think of them as spirits.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.820]   And then those spirits possess all the characters in the complex drama to a greater or lesser
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.820]   degree.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.980]   And that battle is fought out both socially and internally.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:28.580]   In the high-order religious conceptualizations in the West, if they culminate, let's say,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.120]   in the Christian story, the notion is that battle between good and evil is fundamentally
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.300]   played out as an internal drama.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:43.260]   Yeah, so for a religious ethos, the battle between good and evil is fought within each
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.700]   individual human heart.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.700]   Right.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.640]   It's your moral duty to constrain evil within yourself.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:55.140]   And while there's more to it than that, because there's also the insistence that if you do
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:02.020]   that, that makes you the most effective possible warrior, let's say, against evil itself in
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:07.160]   the social world, that you start with the battle that occurs within you, in the soul,
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   let's say.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.060]   The soul becomes the battleground between the forces of good and evil.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:18.120]   There's an idea there too, which is if that battle is undertaken successfully, then it
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   doesn't have to be played out in the social world as actual conflict.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.700]   You can rectify the conflict internally without it having to be played out as fate, as Jung
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.700]   put it.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:34.400]   So what would you say to Nietzsche, who called Christianity the slave morality?
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.980]   His critique of religion in that way was slave morality versus master morality, and then
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.700]   you put an ubermensch into that?
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:48.860]   See, I would say that the woke phenomenon is the manifestation of the slave morality
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:58.140]   that Nietzsche criticized, and that there are elements of Christianity that can be gerrymandered
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:04.180]   to support that mode of perception and conception.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:09.680]   But I think he was wrong, and he was wrong in his essential criticism of Christianity
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.680]   in that regard.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:17.100]   Now, it's complicated with Nietzsche, because Nietzsche never criticizes the gospel stories
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.100]   directly.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:23.660]   What he basically criticizes is something like the pathologies of institutionalized
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.660]   religion.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:32.220]   But most particularly of the, what would you say, of the sort of casually too nice
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.100]   Protestant form.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:40.980]   You know, that's a thumbnail sketch and perhaps somewhat unfair, but given the alignment,
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:46.420]   let's say, of the more mainstream Protestant movements with the woke mob, I don't think
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.880]   it's an absurd criticism.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:54.060]   It's something like the degeneration of Christianity into the notion that good and
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:27:00.740]   harmless are the same thing, or good and empathic are the same thing, which is simply not true,
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.580]   and far too simplified.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:08.060]   And I also think Nietzsche was extremely wrong in his presumption that human beings should
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.060]   take it to themselves to construct their own values.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.820]   I think he made a colossal error in that presumption.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:18.400]   And that is the idea of the ubermensch, that the great individual, the best of us should
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.540]   create our own values.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:26.740]   And I think the reason that he was wrong about that is that, so when God gives instructions
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.180]   to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, he basically tells them that they can do anything
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.500]   they want in the walled garden.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.700]   So that's the kind of balance between order and nature that makes up the human environment.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:43.660]   Human beings have the freedom, vouchsafed to them by God, to do anything they want in
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.500]   the garden except to mess with the most fundamental rules.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.420]   So God says to people, you're not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:58.080]   Which fundamentally means, there is an implicit moral order and you're to abide by it.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.340]   Your freedom stops at the foundation.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:06.220]   And you can think about that, or I'd be interested even in your ideas about this as an engineer,
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:13.780]   let's say, is that there is an ethos that's implicit in being itself.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.040]   And your ethos has to be a reflection of that.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.840]   And that isn't under your control.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:24.860]   You can't gerrymander the foundation because your foundational beliefs have to put you
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.440]   in harmony, like musical harmony, with the actual structure of reality as such.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.360]   So I can give you an example of that.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:37.660]   So our goal, insofar as we're conducting ourselves properly, is to have the kind of interesting
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:44.620]   conversation that allows both of us to express ourselves in a manner that enables us to learn
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.500]   and grow, such that we can share that with everyone who's listening.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.380]   And if our aim is true and upward, then that's what we're doing.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:59.540]   Well, that means that we're going to have to match ourselves to a pattern of interaction.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.100]   And that's marked for us emotionally, like you and I both know this.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.780]   If we're doing this right, we're going to be interested in the conversation.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.540]   We're not going to be looking at our watch.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.100]   We're not going to be thinking about what we're aiming at.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.300]   We're just going to communicate.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.880]   Now, the religious interpretation of that would be that we were doing something like
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.420]   making the redemptive logos manifest between us in dialogue.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.740]   And that's something that can be shared.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.420]   To do that, we have to align with that pattern.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.100]   I can't decide that there's some arbitrary way that I'm going to play you.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.980]   I mean, I could do that if I was a psychopathic manipulator, but to do that optimally, I'm
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:41.940]   not going to impose a certain mode of, a certain a priori aim, let's say, on our communication
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.220]   and manipulate you into that.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:54.380]   So the constraints on my ethos reflect the actual structure of the world.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.860]   And I can't, this is the communist presumption, it's like, we're going to burn everything
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.340]   down and we're going to start from scratch.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.420]   We've got these axiomatic presumptions and we're going to put them into place and we're
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.980]   going to socialize people so they now think and live like communists from day one.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.360]   And human beings are infinitely malleable.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.500]   And we can use a rational set of presuppositions to decide what sort of beings they should
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.500]   be.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.660]   The transhumanists are doing this too.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.820]   It's like, no, there's a pattern of being that you have to fall into alignment with.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:30.240]   And I think it's the pattern of being, by the way, that if you fall into alignment with,
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:36.340]   it gives you hope, it protects you from anxiety, and it gives you a sense of harmony with your
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.880]   surroundings and with other people.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.060]   And none of that's arbitrary.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:44.720]   But don't you think we both arrive to this conversation with rigid axioms?
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.180]   That we have, maybe we're blind to them, but in the same way that the Marxists came with
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.980]   very rigid axioms about the way the world is and the way it should be, aren't we coming
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.980]   to that?
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.820]   Well, we definitely come to the conversation with a hierarchy of foundational axioms,
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.820]   right?
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.740]   I would say the more sophisticated you are as a thinker, the deeper the level at which
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.340]   you're willing to play.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:11.780]   So imagine first that you have presumptions of different depth, there's more predicated
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:17.820]   on the more fundamental axioms, and then that there's a space of play around those.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:23.060]   And that space of play is going to depend on the sophistication of the player, obviously.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:29.380]   But those who are capable of engaging in deeper conversations talk about more fundamental
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.940]   things with more play.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:35.700]   Now we have to come to the conversation with a certain degree of structure because we wouldn't
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:41.860]   be able to understand each other or communicate if a lot of things weren't already assumed
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.880]   or taken for granted.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.420]   How rigid is the hierarchy of axioms that religion provides?
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.040]   This is what I'm trying to understand.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.420]   The rigidity of that hierarchy- It's as rigid as play.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.740]   Well play is not rigid at all.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.020]   No, no, no, no, no, no, it's got a rigidity- There's some constraints.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.260]   It took me about 40 years to figure out the answer to that question.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.860]   So I'm serious about that.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   So it wasn't a random answer.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.220]   So play is very rigid in some ways.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.580]   So if you and I go out to play basketball or chess, there are rules and you can't break
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.560]   the rules because then you're no longer in the game.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.740]   But then there's a dynamism within those rules that's- Well with chess it's virtually infinite.
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.740]   I think, what is it?
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.200]   There's more patterns of potential games on a chess board than there are subatomic particles
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.860]   in the observable universe.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.020]   Like it's an insane space.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.600]   So it's not like there's not freedom within it.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.000]   But it's a weird paradox in a way, isn't it?
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.040]   Because music is like this too, is that there are definitely rules.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.500]   And so there are things- You can't throw a basketball onto a chess board and still be
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.820]   playing chess.
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:53.540]   But weirdly enough, if you adhere to the rules, the realm of freedom increases rather than
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.660]   decreasing.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.860]   And I think you can make the same case for a playful conversation.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.540]   It's like we're playing by certain rules and a lot of them are implicit.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:06.300]   But that doesn't mean that- It might mean the reverse of constraint.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.400]   You know, because in this seminar, for example, that I was referring to, the Exodus Seminar
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.620]   and then the Gospel Seminar, everybody in the seminar, there's about eight of us, played
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.620]   fair.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.100]   Nobody used power.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.580]   Nobody tried to prove they were right.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.460]   They put forward their points, but they were like, "Here's a way of looking at that."
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.600]   "Assess it."
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.540]   And they were also doing it genuinely.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:33.780]   It's like, "This is what I've concluded about, say, this story, and I'm going to make a case
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.780]   for it.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.500]   But I'd like to hear what you have to say because maybe you can change it.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.500]   You can extend it.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.700]   You can find a flaw in it."
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.660]   And that's a conversation that has flow and that's engaging and that other people will
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.660]   listen to as well.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.340]   And that's also- See, I think that one of the things that we can conclude now, and we
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:56.180]   can do this even from a neuroscientific basis, is that that sense of engaged meaning is a
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:01.100]   marker, not only for the emergence of harmony between you and your environment, but for
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:07.100]   the emergence of that harmony in a way that is developmentally rich, that moves you upward
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:13.940]   towards, what would you say, well, I think towards a more effective entropic state.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.580]   That's actually the technical answer to that.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.100]   But it makes you more than you are, and there's a directionality in that.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.500]   - Well, I would like to sort of, the reason I like talking about communism, because it
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:31.540]   has clearly been shown as a set of ideas to be destructive to humanity, but I would like
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:39.980]   to understand from an engineering perspective, the characteristics of communism versus religion,
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.940]   where you could identify religious thought is going to lead to a better human being,
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.440]   a better society, and communist Marxist thought is not.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.660]   Because there's ambiguity, there's room for play in communism and Marxism, because they
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:59.080]   kind of had a utopian sense of where everybody's headed, don't know how it's going to happen,
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.020]   maybe revolution is required, but after the revolution is done, we'll figure it out.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.260]   And there's an underlying assumption that maybe human beings are good, and they'll figure
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.820]   it out once you remove the oppressor.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:17.980]   All these ideas kind of, until you put them into practice, they can be quite convincing
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.940]   if you're in the 19th century.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:26.860]   If I was reading, which is kind of fascinating, the 19th century produced such powerful ideas,
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.860]   Marx and Nietzsche.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.340]   - Oh, fascism too, for that matter.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.340]   - Fascism.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:37.580]   So, you know, if I was sitting there, especially if I'm feeling shitty about myself, a lot
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:41.940]   of these ideas are pretty powerful, as a way to plug the nihilist hole.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.900]   - Yeah, right, absolutely, well, and some of them may actually have an appropriate scope
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.900]   of application.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:53.100]   Like, it could be that some of the foundational axioms of communism, socialism/communism,
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:58.860]   are actually functional in a sufficiently small social group, maybe a tribal group even.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:04.980]   Like, I also have a, I'm not sure this is correct, but I have a suspicion that the pervasive
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:10.980]   attractiveness of some of the radical left ideas that we're talking about are pervasive
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:17.180]   precisely because they are functional within, say, families, but also within the small tribal
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.860]   groups that people might have originally evolved into.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:27.100]   And that once we become civilized, so we produce societies that are united, even among people
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.860]   who don't know one another, different principles have to apply as a consequence of scale.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.900]   So that's partly an engineering response, but I think there's a deeper way of going
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.900]   after the communist problem.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:44.420]   So I think part of the communist, the problem, fundamental problem with the communist axioms
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:51.500]   is the notion that the world of complex social interactions can be simplified sufficiently
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.620]   so that centralized planning authorities can deal with it.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:59.580]   And I think the best way to think about the free exchange rejoinder to that presumption
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:05.680]   is, no, the sum total of human interactions in a large civilization are so immense that
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.780]   you need a distributed network of cognition in order to compute the proper way forward.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:16.140]   And so what you do is you give each actor their domain of individual choice so that
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.660]   they can maximize their own movement forward and you allow the aggregate direction to emerge
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:25.620]   from that rather than trying to impose it from the top down, which I think is computationally
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.160]   impossible.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.220]   So that might be one engineering reason why the communist solution doesn't work.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:36.120]   Like I read in Solzhenitsyn, for example, that the central Soviet authorities often
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.200]   had to make 200 pricing decisions a day.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:47.140]   Now if you've ever started a business or created a product and had to wrestle with
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.620]   the problem of pricing, you'd become aware of just how intractable that is.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.140]   Like how do you calculate worth?
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.460]   Well, there's the central existential problem of life.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.440]   How do you calculate worth?
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.980]   It's not something like a central authority can sit down and just manage.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:09.580]   And there is a lot of inputs that go into a pricing decision and the free market answer
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:14.140]   to that is something like, well, if you get the price right, people will buy it and you'll
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.140]   survive.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.820]   This is a fascinating way to describe how ideas fail.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:23.180]   So communism perhaps fails because, just like what people believe, the earth is flat.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:30.100]   When you look outside, it looks flat, but you can't see beyond the horizon, I guess.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:35.000]   In the same way with communism, communism seems like a great idea in my family, in my
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.580]   people I love, but it doesn't scale.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.580]   And it doesn't iterate.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.580]   It doesn't iterate.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.980]   And that's a form of scaling, too.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.980]   Right.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.340]   Well, I mean, whatever ways it breaks down, it doesn't scale.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.260]   And you're saying religious thought is a thing that might scale.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:54.060]   I would say religious thought is the record of those ideas that have, in fact, scaled.
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.060]   Right.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.060]   And iterated.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.060]   And iterated.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.060]   Does religious thought iterate?
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:04.580]   So, I mean, there's a fundamental conservative aspect to religious thought, tradition.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.260]   This is why, like Mircea Eliade, for example, who I referred to earlier, one of the things
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.300]   Eliade did, and very effectively, and people like Joseph Campbell, who in some ways were
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:21.140]   popularizers of Eliade's ideas and Carl Jung's, what they really did was devote themselves
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:26.900]   to an analysis of those ideas that scaled and iterated across the largest possible spans
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.900]   of time.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:33.940]   And so, Eliade and Jung, Eric Neumann, and Campbell, they were looking at patterns of
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.720]   narrative that were common across religious traditions that had spanned millennia.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.820]   And found many patterns.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.260]   The hero's myth, for example, is one of those patterns.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:47.620]   And I think the evidence that it has its reflection in human neurophysiology and neuropsychology
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.140]   is incontrovertible.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:53.300]   And so, these foundational narratives, they last.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.220]   They're common across multiple religious traditions.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.420]   They unite.
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.780]   They work psychologically.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.940]   But they also reflect the underlying neurophysiological architecture.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.180]   So, I can give you an example of that.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.360]   So, the hero myth is really a quest myth.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.020]   And a quest myth is really a story of exploration and expansion of adaptation.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   Right?
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.840]   So, Bilbo the Hobbit, he's kind of an ordinary everyman.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:21.300]   He lives in a very constrained and orderly and secure world.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:25.780]   And then the quest call comes and he goes out and he expands his personality and develops
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.780]   his wisdom.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:31.800]   And that's reflected in human neuropsychological architecture at a very low level.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   Way below cognition.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:38.500]   So, one of the most fundamental elements of the mammalian brain, and even in lower animal
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.160]   forms, is the hypothalamus.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.680]   It's sort of the root of primary motivation.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:49.380]   So, it governs lust and it regulates your breathing and it regulates your hunger and
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.880]   it regulates your thirst and it regulates your temperature.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:56.960]   Like really low-level biological necessities are regulated by the hypothalamus.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.520]   When you get hungry, it's the hypothalamus.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.640]   When you're activated in a defensively aggressive manner, that's the hypothalamus.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.320]   Half the hypothalamus is the origin of the dopaminergic tracts.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.680]   And they subsume exploration.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:17.960]   And so, you could think of the human motivational reality as a domain that's governed by axiomatic
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:23.320]   motivational states - love, sex, defensive aggression, hunger - and another domain that's
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.160]   governed by exploration.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:30.880]   And the rule would be something like, "When your basic motivational states are sated,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.540]   explore."
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.840]   And that's not cognitive.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.960]   Like I said, this is deep, deep brain architecture.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.080]   It's extraordinarily ancient.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.640]   And the exploration story is something like, "Go out into the unknown and take the risks
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:52.920]   because the information that you discover and the skills you develop will be worthwhile
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.520]   even in sating the basic motivational drives."
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.680]   And then you want to learn to do that in an iterative manner so it sustains across time.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.540]   And you want to do it in a way that unites you with other people.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.620]   And there's a pattern to that.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:09.840]   And I do think that's the pattern that we strive to encapsulate in our deep religious
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   narratives.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.520]   And I think that in many ways we've done that successfully.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.480]   What is the belief in God?
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.480]   How does that fit in?
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   What does it mean to believe in God?
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.240]   Okay, so in one of the stories that I cover in We Who Wrestle With God, which I've only
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:31.080]   recently begun to take apart, say, in the last two years, is the story of Abraham.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.860]   It's a very cool story.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.620]   And it's also related, by the way, to your question about what makes communism wrong.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.400]   And Dostoevsky knew this.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.400]   Not precisely the Abraham story, but the same reason.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.680]   In Notes from Underground, Dostoevsky made a very telling observation.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:53.280]   So he speaks in the voice of a cynical, nihilistic, and bitter bureaucrat who's been a failure.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.440]   Who's talking cynically about the nature of human beings.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   But also very accurately.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.640]   And one of the things he points out, with regards to modern utopianism, is that human
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.420]   beings are very strange creatures.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:10.120]   And that if you gave them what the socialist utopians want to give them, so let's say all
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.560]   your needs are taken care of.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.680]   All your material needs are taken care of, and even indefinitely.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.720]   Dostoevsky's claim was, you don't understand human beings very well, because if you put
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:24.920]   them in an environment that was that comfortable, they would purposefully go insane just to
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.400]   break it into bits, just so something interesting would happen.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.400]   Right.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.600]   And he says it's the human proclivity to curse and complain.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.880]   He says this in quite a cynic and caustic manner, but he's pointing to something deep.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.040]   Which is that we're not built for comfort and security.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.360]   We're not infants.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.000]   We're not after satiation.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.040]   So then you might ask, well what the hell are we after then?
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.200]   That's what the Abraham story addresses.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.160]   And Abraham is the first true individual in the biblical narrative.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:00.200]   So you can think about his story as the archetypal story of the developing individual.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   So you said, well what's God?
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.580]   Well in the Abraham story, God is characterized in a lot of different ways in the classic
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.900]   religious texts.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:13.480]   Like the Bible is actually a compilation of different characterizations of the divine.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.080]   With the insistence that they reflect an underlying unity.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.960]   In the story of Abraham, the divine is the call to adventure.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.660]   So Abraham has the socialist utopia at hand.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.040]   He's from a wealthy family, and he has everything he needs.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.280]   And he actually doesn't do anything until he's in his seventies.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.860]   Now, hypothetically people in those times lived much longer.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:41.000]   But a voice comes to Abraham and it tells him something very specific.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.560]   It says, "Leave your zone of comfort.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   Leave your parents.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   Leave your tent.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   Leave your community.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   Leave your tribe.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   Leave your land.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.400]   Go out into the world."
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   And Abraham thinks, well why?
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:59.280]   I've got naked slave girls peeling grapes and feeding them to me.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.820]   It's like, what do I need an adventure for?
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.080]   And God tells him, and this is the covenant, by the way.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:09.280]   Part of the covenant that the God of the Israelites makes with his people.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.840]   It's very, very specific.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.920]   It's very brilliant.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:18.720]   He says, "If you follow the voice of adventure, you'll become a blessing to yourself."
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.880]   So that's a good deal because people generally live at odds with themselves.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.360]   And he says, God says, "That's not all.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:32.560]   You'll become a blessing to yourself in a way that furthers your reputation among people
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:37.040]   and validly so that you'll accomplish things that were real and people will know it and
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.080]   you'll be held high in their esteem and that will be valid."
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:47.880]   So that's a pretty good deal because social people would like to be regarded as of utility
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.080]   and worth by others.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.760]   And so that's a good deal.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.920]   And God says, "That's not all.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.040]   You'll establish something of lasting permanent and deep value."
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.280]   That's why Abraham becomes the father of nations.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.560]   And finally he caps it off and he says, "There's a better element even to it.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.160]   There's a capstone.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:11.400]   You'll do all three of those things in a way that's maximally beneficial to everyone else."
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.800]   And so the divinity in the Abrahamic story is making a claim.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:19.980]   He says, "First of all, there's a drive that you should attend to.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.800]   So the spirit of adventure that calls you out of your zone of comfort.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.360]   Now if you attend to that and you make the sacrifices necessary to follow that path,
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.640]   then the following benefits will accrue to you.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.680]   Your life will be a blessing.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.800]   Everyone will hold you in high esteem.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.200]   You'll establish something of permanent value and you'll do it in a way that's maximally
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.960]   beneficial to everyone else."
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:45.800]   And so think about what this means biologically or from an engineering standpoint.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.600]   It means that the instinct to develop that characterizes outward-moving children, let's
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:57.280]   say, or adults, is the same instinct that allows for psychological stability, that allows
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:02.720]   for movement upward in the social hierarchy, that establishes something iterable, and that
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.840]   does that in a manner that allows everyone else to partake in the same process.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.780]   Well, you know, that's a good deal.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:15.240]   And I can't see how it cannot be true because the alternative hypothesis would be that the
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:20.960]   spirit that moves you beyond yourself to develop, the spirit of a curious child, let's say,
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.920]   what is that antithetical to?
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.920]   Your own esteem?
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.340]   Is that antithetical to other people's best interest?
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:32.520]   Is it not the thing that increases the probability that you'll do something permanent?
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.800]   That's a stupid theory.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.440]   So God is a call to adventure with some constraints.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.120]   A call to true adventure.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.120]   To true adventure.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   True adventure.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:47.880]   Yeah, and then that's a good observation because that begs the question, what constitutes the
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.760]   most true adventure?
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.840]   Well that's not fully fleshed out until, at least from the Christian perspective, let's
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.800]   say, that's not fully fleshed out until the Gospels.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:02.920]   Because the passion of Christ is the, you could say, this is the perfectly reasonable
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:07.680]   way of looking at it, the passion of Christ is the truest adventure of Abraham.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.000]   That's a terrible thing, eh?
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.800]   Because the passion story is a catastrophic tragedy, although it obviously has its redemptive
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   elements.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.400]   But one of the things that's implied there is that there's no distinction between the
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.540]   true adventure of life and taking on the pathway of maximal responsibility and burden.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.880]   And I can't see how that cannot be true.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:35.480]   Because the counter-hypothesis is, well Lex, the best thing for you to do in your life
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:39.800]   is to shrink from all challenge and hide.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:44.280]   To remain infantile, to remain secure, not to ever push yourself beyond your limits,
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.960]   not to take any risks.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.200]   Well no one thinks that's true.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:54.760]   So basically the maximally worthwhile adventure could possibly be highly correlated with the
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.780]   hardest possible available adventure.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:03.140]   The hardest possible available adventure voluntarily undertaken.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.480]   Does it have to be voluntary?
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.480]   Absolutely!
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.940]   How do you define voluntarily?
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.740]   Well here's an example of that.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.780]   That's a good question, too.
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:17.500]   When Christ is, the night before the crucifixion, which in principle he knows is coming, he
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.660]   asks God to relieve him of his burden.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.660]   And understandably so.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:27.520]   I mean that's the scene famously in which he's sweating, literally sweating blood.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.020]   Because he knows what's coming.
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:36.660]   And the Romans designed crucifixion to be the most agonizing, humiliating, and disgusting
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.260]   possible death.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.580]   So there is every reason to be apprehensive about that.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:45.300]   And you might say, well could you undertake that voluntarily as an adventure?
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:51.260]   And the answer to that is something like, well what's your relationship with death?
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.920]   That's a problem you have to solve.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.780]   And you could fight it, and you could be bitter about it, and there's reasons for that.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.900]   Especially if it's painful and degrading.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:07.100]   But the alternative is something like, well that's what's fleshed out in religious imagery
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.100]   always.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.700]   It's very difficult to cast into words.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.540]   It's like, no, you welcome the struggle.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.540]   That's why I called the book "We Who Wrestle With God".
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.940]   You welcome the struggle.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:24.980]   But Lex, I don't see how you can come to terms with life without construing it something
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:29.760]   like, construing it as something like, bring it on.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.020]   Welcome the struggle.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.820]   And I can't see that there's a limit to that.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:37.260]   It's like, well I welcome the struggle until it gets difficult.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:41.660]   So there's not a bell curve, like the struggle in moderation.
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:46.300]   Basically you have to welcome whatever, as hard as it gets.
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.780]   And the crucifixion in that way is a symbol of that.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.420]   Well, it's worse than that in some ways.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:57.900]   Because the crucifixion exemplifies the worst possible death.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.460]   But that isn't the only element of the struggle.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:06.380]   Because mythologically, classically, after Christ's death he harrows hell.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:11.740]   And what that means as far as I can tell, psychologically, is that you're not only required,
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.500]   let's say, to take on the full existential burden of life and to welcome it, regardless
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:23.060]   of what it is, and to maintain your upward aim despite all temptations to the contrary.
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:26.820]   But you also have to confront the root of malevolence itself.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.340]   So it's not merely tragedy.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.780]   And I think the malevolence is actually worse.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:35.660]   And the reason I think that is because I know the literature on post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:41.420]   And most people who encounter, let's say, a challenge that's so brutal that it fragments
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.680]   them, it isn't mere suffering that does that to people.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.260]   It's an encounter with malevolence that does that to people.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:53.020]   Their own sometimes, often, by the way, a soldier will go out into a battlefield and
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.940]   find out that there's a part of him that really enjoys the mayhem.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.180]   And that conceptualization doesn't fit in well with everything he thinks he knows about
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.260]   himself and humanity.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:10.460]   And after that contact with that dark part of himself, he never recovers.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.280]   That happens to people.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.140]   And it happens to people who encounter bad actors in the world, too.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:21.340]   If you're a naive person and the right narcissistic psychopath comes your way, you are in mortal
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.980]   trouble because you might die.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.060]   But that's not where the trouble ends.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:33.780]   If there's a young man in their 20s listening to this, how do they escape the pull of Dostoyevsky's
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.780]   Notes from Underground?
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:39.460]   With the eyes open to the world, how do they select the adventure?
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:44.860]   So there's other characterizations of the divine, say, in the Old Testament story.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:49.340]   So one pattern of characterization that I think is really relevant to that question
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:53.780]   is the conception of God as calling and conscience.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.140]   Okay, so what does it mean?
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:53:01.860]   It's a description of the manner in which your destiny announces itself to you.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:08.060]   And I'm using that terminology, and it's distinguishable, say, from Nietzsche's notion that you create
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.060]   your own values.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:14.460]   It's like, part of the way you can tell that that's wrong is that you can't voluntarily
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:18.020]   gerrymander your own interests, right?
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:23.740]   Like you find some things interesting, and that seems natural and autonomous, and other
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:27.900]   things you don't find interesting, and you can't really force yourself to be interested
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.900]   in them.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:33.900]   Now, so what is the domain of interest that makes itself manifest to you?
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.660]   Well, it's like an autonomous spirit.
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:39.860]   It's like certain things in your field of perception are illuminated to you.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.020]   You think, "Oh, that's interesting.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.020]   That's compelling.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.020]   That's gripping."
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:51.780]   Rudolf Otto, who studied the phenomenology of religious experience, described that as
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:52.780]   numinous.
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:57.340]   The thing grips you because you're compelled by it, and maybe it's also somewhat anxiety-provoking.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:02.380]   It's the same reaction that a cat has to a dog when the cat's hair stands on end.
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:03.900]   That's an awe response.
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:09.620]   And so there's going to be things in your phenomenological field that pull you forward,
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:10.620]   compel you.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:14.100]   That's like the voice of positive emotion and enthusiasm.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.340]   Things draw you into the world.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.340]   It might be love.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.100]   It might be aesthetic interest.
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.620]   It might be friendship.
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.980]   It might be social status.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:27.500]   It might be duty and industriousness.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:32.100]   There's various domains of interest that shine for people.
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.060]   That's sort of on the positive side.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.880]   God is calling.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:39.660]   That would be akin to the spirit of adventure for Abraham.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:45.020]   But there's also God is conscience, and this is a useful thing to know too.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.820]   Certain things bother you.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:54.280]   They take root within you, and they turn your thoughts towards certain issues.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.460]   Like there are things you're interested in that you've pursued your whole life.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:01.900]   There are things I'm interested in that I felt as a moral compulsion.
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.660]   And so you could think, and I think the way you can think about it technically is that
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:11.780]   something pulls you forward so that you move ahead and you develop.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.180]   And then another voice, this is a voice of negative emotion, says, "While you're moving
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.620]   forward, stay on this narrow pathway."
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:26.780]   And it'll mark deviations, and it marks deviations with shame and guilt and anxiety, regret.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.460]   And that actually has a voice.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.460]   Don't do that.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:30.460]   Well, why not?
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.580]   While you're wandering off the straight and narrow path.
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:37.700]   So the divine marks the pathway forward and reveals it, but then puts up the constraints
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.900]   of conscience.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:45.520]   And the divine in the Old Testament is portrayed, not least, as the dynamic between calling
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.940]   and conscience.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.660]   What do you do with the negative emotions?
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.660]   You didn't mention envy.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:54.060]   There's some really dark ones that can really pull you into some bad places.
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.380]   Envy, fear.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.500]   Yeah, envy's a really bad one.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.700]   Pride and envy are among the worst.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:02.860]   Those are the sins of Cain, by the way, in the story of Cain and Abel.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.600]   Because Cain fails because his sacrifices are insufficient.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.480]   He doesn't offer his best.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.900]   And so he's rejected, and that makes him bitter and unhappy.
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.540]   And he goes to complain to God, and God says to him two things.
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:21.260]   He said, if God tells him, "If your sacrifices were appropriate, you'd be accepted."
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.420]   It's a brutal thing.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.060]   It's a brutal rejoinder.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:29.400]   And he also says, "You can't blame your misery on your failure.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.780]   You could learn from your failure.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.300]   When you failed, you invited in the spirit of envy and resentment, and you allowed it
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.300]   to possess you.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:37.900]   And that's why you're miserable."
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:43.000]   And so Cain is embittered by that response, and that's when he kills Abel.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.100]   And so you might say, well, how do you fortify yourself against that pathway of resentment?
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:54.780]   And part of classic religious practice is aimed to do that precisely.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.460]   What's the antithesis of envy?
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.460]   Gratitude.
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.620]   That's something you can practice.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.620]   Right?
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.380]   And I mean literally practice.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:07.900]   I think envy is one of the biggest enemies for a young person, because basically you're
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.740]   starting from nowhere.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.740]   Life is hard.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.180]   You've achieved nothing.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.980]   And you're striving, and you're failing constantly.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:21.420]   And you see other people whom you think aren't having the same problem.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.420]   And they succeeded.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.420]   And they could be your neighbor.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.560]   They could be succeeding by a little bit, or somebody on the internet succeeding by
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.560]   a lot.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.960]   And I think that that can really pull a person down.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.500]   That kind of envy can really destroy a person.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.780]   Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:40.900]   Well, the gratitude element would be something like, well, yeah, you don't know anything,
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:45.740]   and you're at the bottom, but you're not 80.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:52.900]   You know, one of the best predictors of wealth in the United States is age.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:56.420]   So then you might say, well, who's got it better?
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.180]   The old rich guy or the young poor guy?
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:03.800]   And I would say most old rich guys would trade their wealth for youth.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:09.000]   So it's not exactly clear at all at any stage who's got the upper hand, who's got the advantage.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.960]   And you know, you could say, well, I've got all these burdens in front of me because I'm
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.360]   young, and oh my God.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.280]   Or you could say, every dragon has its treasure.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.560]   And that's actually a pattern of perception.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.360]   You know, I'm not saying that people don't have their challenges.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.880]   They certainly do.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:32.060]   But discriminating between a challenge and an opportunity is very, very difficult.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:37.140]   And learning to see a challenge as an opportunity, that's the beginning of wisdom.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.140]   It's interesting.
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.460]   I don't know how it works.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:41.340]   Maybe you can elucidate.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:48.820]   But when you have enemy towards somebody, if you just celebrate them, so gratitude,
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:54.020]   but actually as opposed to sort of ignoring and being grateful for the things you have,
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:59.860]   like literally celebrate that person, it transforms, it like, it lights the way.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:01.620]   I don't know why that is exactly.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:05.940]   The only reason you're envious is because you see someone who has something that you
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:06.940]   want.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:07.940]   Okay.
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.940]   So let's think, let's think about it.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:15.540]   Well, first of all, the fact that they have it means that in principle, you could get
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:16.540]   it.
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:17.780]   At least someone has.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.820]   So that's a pretty good deal.
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.820]   And then you might say, well, the fact that I'm envious of that person means that I actually
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:25.300]   want something.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.980]   And then you might think, well, what am I envious of?
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.540]   I'm envious of their attractiveness to women.
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.440]   It's like, okay, well, now you know something about yourself.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:38.300]   You know, that one true motivation that's making itself manifest to you is that you
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.580]   wish that you would be the sort of person who is attractive to women.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:46.540]   Now, of course, that's an extremely common longing among men period, but particularly
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:52.140]   among young men, it's like, well, what makes you so sure you couldn't have that?
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.300]   Well, how about, here's an answer.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:57.020]   You don't have enough faith in yourself.
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.340]   And maybe you don't have enough faith in, well, I would say the divine.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.380]   You don't believe that the world is characterized by enough potentiality so that even miserable
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.620]   you has a crack at the brass ring.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:13.960]   And like, I talked about this actually practically in one of my previous books, because I wrote
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:19.060]   a chapter called Compare Yourself to Who You Are and Not to Someone Else at the Present
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.060]   Time.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.060]   Well, why?
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:25.060]   Well, your best benchmark for tomorrow is you today.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:30.740]   And you might not be able to have what someone else has on the particular axis you're comparing
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.580]   yourself with them on, but you could make an incremental improvement over your current
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.060]   state regardless of the direction that you're aiming.
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:46.500]   And it is the case, and this is a law, the return on incremental improvement is exponential
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.600]   or geometric and not linear.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:54.420]   So even if you start, this is why the hero is always born in a lowly place, mythologically,
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.420]   right?
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.220]   Christ who redeems the world is born in a manger with the animals to poverty-stricken
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:06.780]   parents in the middle of a God-forsaken desert in a nondescript time and place, isolated.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.380]   Well, why?
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:14.340]   Well, because everyone young struggles with their insufficiency, but that doesn't mean
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.180]   that great things can't make themselves manifest.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:22.740]   And part of the insistence in the biblical text, for example, is that it's incumbent
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:30.020]   on you to have the courage, to have faith in yourself and in the spirit of reality,
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:35.700]   the essence of reality, regardless of how you construe the evidence at hand.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.700]   Right.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.700]   Look at me.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.700]   I'm so useless.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.700]   I don't know anything.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.700]   I don't have anything.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.700]   It's hopeless.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.100]   I don't have it within me.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.620]   The world couldn't offer me that possibility.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.700]   Well, what the hell do you know about that?
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.140]   This is what Job figures out in the midst of his suffering in the book of Job, because
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:59.700]   Job is tortured terribly by God, who makes a bet with Satan himself to bring him down.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:05.060]   And Job's decision in the face of his intense suffering is, "I'm not going to lose faith
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.820]   in my essential goodness, and I'm not going to lose faith in the essential goodness of
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:15.320]   being itself, regardless of how terrible the face it's showing to me at the moment happens
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.580]   to be."
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:21.380]   And I think, "Okay, what do you make of that claim?
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.480]   Well, let's look at it practically.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.260]   You're being tortured by the arbitrariness of life.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.260]   That's horrible.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:32.900]   Now you lose faith in yourself, and you become cynical about being.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:38.100]   So are you infinitely worse off instantly?"
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:41.660]   And then you might say, "Well, yeah, but it's really asking a lot of people that they maintain
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:45.220]   faith even in their darkest hours."
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:50.140]   And it's like, yeah, that might be asking everything from people.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:56.840]   But then you also might ask, and this is a very strange question, is, "If you were brought
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:02.940]   into being by something that was essentially good, wouldn't that thing that brought you
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:07.460]   into being demand that you make the best in yourself manifest?
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:14.740]   And wouldn't it be precisely when you most need that that you'd be desperate enough to
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.700]   risk what it would take to let it emerge?"
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:23.340]   So you kind of make it seem that reason could be the thing that takes you out of a place
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:28.020]   of darkness, finding that calling through reason.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:34.780]   I think it's also possible when reason fails you to just take the leap, navigate not by
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:40.740]   reason but by finding the thing that scares you, the risk, to take the risk, take the
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.020]   leap, and then figure it out while you're in the air.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:49.940]   Yeah, well, I think that's always part of a heroic adventure, you know, is that ability
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.500]   to cut the Gordian Knot.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.440]   But you could also ask from an engineering perspective, "Okay, what are the axioms that
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.800]   make a decision like that possible?"
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.260]   And the answer would be something like, "I'm going to make the presumption that if I move
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.820]   forward in good faith, whatever happens to me will be the best thing that could possibly
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.420]   happen, no matter what it is."
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:12.100]   And I think that's actually how you make an alliance with truth.
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.540]   And I also think that truth is an adventure.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:22.780]   And the way you make an alliance with truth is by assuming that whatever happens to you,
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:28.580]   if you're living in truth, is the best thing that could happen, even if you can't see that
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.580]   at any given moment.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.540]   Because otherwise, you'd say that truth would be just the handmaiden of advantage.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:38.500]   "Well, I'm going to say something truthful, and I pay a price."
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.820]   "Well, that means I shouldn't have said it."
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.980]   Possibly.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.380]   But that's not the only possible standard of evaluation.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.100]   Because what you're doing is you're making the outcome your deity.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.100]   Right?
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.140]   Well, I'd just reverse that and say, "No, no.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.020]   Truth is the deity.
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.460]   The outcome is variable."
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.580]   But that doesn't eradicate the initial axiom.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.180]   Where's the constant?
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.180]   What's the constant?
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:10.620]   It may be when you said Abraham was being fed by naked ladies.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:14.660]   That's an interpolation, obviously, but would it have been out of keeping for the times?
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:21.540]   But it does make me think, sort of in stark contrast to Nietzsche's own life, that perhaps
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:26.820]   getting laid early on in life is a useful starter.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.340]   Step one, get laid, and then go for adventure.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.140]   There's some basic recommendation, satiation of basic desires.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:36.500]   I think it's perfectly reasonable to bring the sexual element in, because it's a powerful
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.820]   motivating force, and it has to be integrated.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.340]   I don't think it's adventure.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.700]   It's romantic adventure.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.820]   Right, right.
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:51.140]   But the lack of basic interaction, sexual interaction, I feel like is the engine that
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:57.540]   drives towards that cynicism of the incel in Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground."
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.820]   There's very little doubt about that.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:03.700]   We know perfectly well anthropologically that the most unstable social situation you can
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:07.420]   generate is young men with no access to women.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:13.980]   That's not good, and they'll do anything, anything to reverse that situation.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.300]   So that's very dangerous.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:23.300]   But then I would also say there's every suggestion that the pathway of adventure itself is the
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.260]   best pathway to romantic attractiveness.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.460]   We know this in some ways in a very blunt manner.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:35.580]   The Google boys, the engineers, who are too, what would you say, naively oriented towards
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.280]   empirical truth to note when they're being politically incorrect, they wrote a great
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.780]   book called "A Billion Wicked Thoughts," which I really like.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:47.280]   It's a very good book, and it's engineers as psychologists.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.280]   And so they'll say all sorts of things that no one with any sense would ever say that
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.900]   happen to be true.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:56.620]   And they studied the pattern of pornographic fantasy, and women like pornographic stories,
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.100]   not images.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.800]   So women's use of pornography is literary.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.660]   Who are the main protagonists in female pornographic fantasy?
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:13.900]   Pirates, werewolves, vampires, surgeons, billionaires, Tony Stark, you know?
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:20.060]   And so the basic pornographic narrative is "Beauty and the Beast," those five categories.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:26.660]   Sexual aggressive male, tameable by the right relationship, hot erotic attraction.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:31.200]   And so I would say to the young men who, and I have many times, to the young men who are
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:37.140]   locked in isolation, it's first of all, join the bloody club, because the default value
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:40.960]   of a 15-year-old male on the mating market is zero.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.480]   And there's reason for that.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.740]   You know, and zero is a bit of an exaggeration, but not much.
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.300]   And the reason for that is, well, what the hell do you know?
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.500]   Like you're not good for anything, yet you have potential, and maybe plenty.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.760]   And hopefully that'll be made manifest.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:00.460]   But you shouldn't be all upset, because you're the same loser as everyone else your age has
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.260]   always been since the beginning of time.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.060]   But then you might ask, "Well, what should I do about it?"
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.060]   The answer is, get yourself together, you know?
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.220]   Stand up straight with your shoulders back.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.780]   Take on some adventure.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:12.780]   Find your calling.
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.320]   Abide by your conscience.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.460]   Put yourself together, and you'll become attractive.
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.900]   Look, we know this is true.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:33.080]   The correlation between male sexual opportunity and relative masculine status is about 0.6.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.540]   That's higher than the correlation between intelligence and academic achievement.
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:42.660]   I don't think that there's a larger correlation between two independent phenomena in the entire
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.720]   social science and health literature than the correlation between relative male social
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.220]   status and reproductive success.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.580]   It's by far the most fundamental determinant.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.380]   Well, what's the cause and effect there?
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.380]   It's a loop.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.100]   Men are motivated to attain social status because it confers upon them reproductive
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.100]   success.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.660]   And that's not only cognitively, but biologically.
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.140]   I'll give you an example of this.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.460]   There's a documentary I watch from time to time, which I think is the most brilliant
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:08.740]   documentary I've ever seen.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.380]   It's called Crumb.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:16.620]   And it's the story of this underground cartoonist, Robert Crumb, who was in high school, was
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:25.500]   in the category of males, for whom a date was not only not likely, but unimaginable.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:29.400]   So he was at the bottom of the bottom rung.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.920]   And almost all the reactions he got from females wasn't just, "No."
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.300]   It was like, "Are you out of your mind?"
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.260]   With that contempt.
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.860]   And then he became successful.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:46.620]   And so the documentary is super interesting because it tracks the utter pathology of his
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:49.740]   sexual fantasies, because he was bitter and resentful.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:56.820]   And if you want to understand the psychology of serial sexual killers and the like, and
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.720]   you watch Crumb, you'll find out a lot more about that than anybody with any sense would
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   want to know.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.700]   But then he makes this transition, and partly because he does take the heroic adventure
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.700]   path.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:11.880]   He actually has a family and children, and he's actually a pretty functional person,
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.460]   as opposed to his brothers, one of whom commits suicide, and one of whom is literally a repeat
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.900]   sexual offender.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.580]   It's a brutal documentary.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:26.100]   But what he did in his adolescence, after being rejected, was he found what he was interested
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.100]   in.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.100]   He was a very good artist.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.100]   He was very interested in music.
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:33.060]   And he started to pursue those sort of single-mindedly, and he became successful.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:36.960]   And as soon as he became successful, and the documentary tracks this beautifully, he's
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.620]   immediately attractive to women.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:44.280]   And then you might ask, too, even if you're cynical, it's like, "Why do I have to perform
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.520]   for women?"
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.200]   And the answer to that is something like, "Why the hell should they have anything to
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.080]   do with you if you're useless?
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.160]   They're going to have infants.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.880]   They don't need another one."
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880]   Right?
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:58.020]   Partly the reason that women are hypergamous, unless they want males who are of higher status
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:02.200]   than they are, is because they're trying to redress the reproductive burden.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.200]   And it's substantial.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:10.000]   I mean, the female of any species is the sex that devotes more to the reproductive function.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.040]   That's a more fundamental definition than chromosomal differentiation.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.600]   And that's taken to its ultimate extreme with humans.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.680]   And so of course women are going to want someone around that's useful, because the cost of
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:29.080]   sex for them is an 18-year-old period of dependency with an infant.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.640]   So I think the adventure comes first.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.160]   Heroic adventure comes first.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.040]   Well, it's complex, because the other problem, let's say, with the crumb boys, is that their
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.780]   mother was extremely pathological, and they didn't get a lot of genuine feminine nurturance
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.780]   and affection.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.780]   Oh, of course.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:49.840]   So the family and society are not going to help you most of the time with a heroic adventure,
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.840]   right?
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.120]   They're going to be a barrier versus a catalyst.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.760]   In good families, they're both, because they put up constraints on your behavior.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:04.240]   But I've interviewed a lot of successful people about their calling, let's say, because I
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.160]   do that with all my podcast guests.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:12.360]   How did the path that you took to success make itself manifest?
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.000]   The pattern is very typical.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.160]   Almost all the people that I've interviewed had a mother and a father.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.760]   Now, it's not invariant, but I'd say it's there 99% of the time.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.160]   It's really high.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.560]   And both of the parents, or at least one of them, but often both, were very encouraging
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.000]   of the person's interests and pathway to development.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   That's fascinating.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.040]   I've heard you analyze it that way before, and I had a reaction to that idea, because
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.440]   you focus on the positive of the parents.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:49.720]   I feel like it was the ... Maybe I see biographies differently, but it feels like the struggle
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:55.920]   within the family was the catalyst for greatness in a lot of biographies.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.520]   Maybe I'm misinterpreting it, but I just ...
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520]   No, no, no.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.040]   I don't think you ... I think that that's a reflection, maybe, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.140]   I think that's a reflection of that dynamic between positive and negative emotion.
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:12.560]   Like my son, for example, who's doing just fine, he's firing on all cylinders, as far
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.560]   as I'm concerned.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.560]   He has a nice family.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560]   He gets along with his wife.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560]   He's a really good musician.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560]   He's got a company.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.520]   He's running well.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.880]   He's a delight to be around.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.700]   He was a relatively disagreeable infant.
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:32.360]   He was tough-minded, and he didn't take no for an answer.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.800]   There was some tussle in regulating his behavior.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.400]   He spent a lot of time when he was two, sitting on the steps, trying to get his act together.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:48.540]   That was the constraint, but that wasn't something that was ... It's an opposition to him away,
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:54.160]   because it was in opposition to the immediate manifestation of his hedonistic desires, but
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.520]   it was also an impetus to further development.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.680]   The rule for me, when he was on the stairs, was as soon as you're willing to be a civilized
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.280]   human being, you can get off the stairs.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:09.240]   You might think, "Well, that's nothing but arbitrary, superego, patriarchal, oppressive
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.240]   constraint."
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.240]   Or you could say, "Well, no.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.560]   What I'm actually doing is facilitating his cortical maturation, because when a child
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.400]   misbehaves, it's usually because they're under the domination of some primordial emotional
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.480]   or motivational impulse.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:31.280]   They're angry, they're overenthusiastic, they're upset, they're selfish, like it's narrow self-centeredness
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.440]   expressed in a immature manner."
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:40.360]   But see, okay, tell me if I'm wrong, but it feels like the engine of greatness, at least
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:46.920]   on the male side of things, has often been trying to prove the father wrong, or trying
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.400]   to gain the acceptance of the father.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:56.160]   So that tension, where the parent is not encouraging, like you mentioned, but is basically saying,
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.760]   "No, you won't be able to do this."
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:04.640]   Okay, so my observation as a psychologist has been that it's very, very difficult for
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.160]   someone to get their act together, unless they have at least one figure in their life
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.940]   that's encouraging and shows them the pathway forward.
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:18.440]   So you can have a lot of adversity in your life, and if you have one person around who's
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.400]   a good model, and you're neurologically intact, you can latch onto that model.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.400]   Now, you can also find that model in books, and people do that sometimes.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.120]   Like I've interviewed people who had pretty fragmented childhoods, who turned to books
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:38.000]   and found the pattern that guided them in, let's say, the adventures of the heroes of
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.400]   the past, because that's a good way of thinking about it.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:46.400]   And I read a book called Angela's Ashes, that was written by an Irish author, Frank McCourt,
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.960]   it's a fantastic book, beautiful book.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:56.560]   And his father was an alcoholic of gargantuan proportions, an Irish drinker who drank every
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.840]   scent that came into the family, and many of whose children died in poverty.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:07.900]   And what Frank did, it's a testament to the human spirit, is he sort of divided his father
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.600]   conceptually into two elements.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:15.400]   There was sober morning father, who was encouraging and with whom he had a relationship, and then
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:23.600]   there was drunk and useless later afternoon and evening father, and he rejected the negative,
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.280]   and he amplified his relationship with the positive.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:35.680]   Now he had other things going for him, but he did a very good job of discriminating.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.640]   And I mean, partly the question that you're raising is, to what degree is it useful to
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.440]   have a beneficial adversary?
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:49.060]   Yeah, and I mean, struggle-free progress is not possible.
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:54.500]   And I think there are situations under which where, you know, you might be motivated to
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:17:02.780]   prove someone in your immediate circle wrong, but then that also implies that at some level,
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.540]   for some reason, you actually care about their judgment, you know, you just didn't write
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.540]   them off completely.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:13.760]   Well, I mean, that's why I say there's an archetype of a young man trying to gain the
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.260]   approval of his father.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:22.900]   And I think that repeats itself in a bunch of biographies that I've read.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:29.680]   I don't know, there must have been an engine somewhere that they found of approval of encouragement.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:34.400]   Maybe in books, maybe in the mother, or maybe the role of the parents is flipped.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:38.080]   Well, my father was hard to please, very.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.640]   Did you ever succeed?
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.840]   Yes, but it wasn't easy, ever.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.800]   When was the moment when you succeeded?
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   Late, pretty late, like 40, maybe later.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:57.520]   Was it gradual or a definitive moment when a shift happened?
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:04.920]   My father was always willing to approve of the things I did that were good, although
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:10.400]   he was not effusive by any stretch of the imagination and the standards were very high.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:16.480]   Now, I was probably fortunate for me, you know, and it does bear on the question you're
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:23.720]   asking is like, if you want someone to motivate you optimally, God, it's complicated because
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.120]   there has to be a temperamental dance between the two people.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:34.240]   Like what you really want is for someone to apply the highest possible standards to you
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.480]   that you're capable of reaching, right?
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:44.800]   And that's a vicious dance because you have to have a relationship with your child to
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.800]   do that properly.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.200]   You know, because if you want to be optimally motivating as a father, you keep your children
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.200]   on the edge.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:57.120]   Like you might not reward something in your child that you would think would be good in
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.480]   someone else because you think they could do better.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.860]   And so my father was pretty clear about the idea that he always expected me to do better.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.880]   And was that troublesome?
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:14.400]   It was like, I felt often when I was young that there was no pleasing him.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.800]   But I also knew that that wasn't, I knew that that wasn't right.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.920]   See, I actually knew that wasn't right.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:27.400]   Because I could remember, especially I think when I was very young, that I did things that
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.520]   he was pleased about.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.840]   I knew that was possible.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:36.400]   So it wasn't unpredictable and arbitrary, it was just difficult.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.920]   It sounds like he's hit a pretty good optimal, but it's for each individual human that optimal
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.920]   differs.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.080]   Well, that's why you have to have a relationship with your children.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.000]   You have to know them.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.480]   And well, with yourself too.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.440]   And with your wife.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.120]   You can't hit that optimal.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.740]   That optimal is probably love.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:03.000]   Because love isn't just acceptance.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.480]   Love is acceptance and encouragement.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.800]   And it's not just that either.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.060]   It's also, no, don't do that.
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.120]   That's beneath you.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.600]   You're capable of more.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.840]   How harsh should that be?
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.440]   It's like, that's a really hard question.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.280]   You know, like if you really love someone, you're not going to put up with their stupidity.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.280]   Don't do that.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.840]   You know, one of the rules I had with my little kids was, don't do anything that makes you
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.480]   look like an idiot in public.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.480]   Why?
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.820]   Because I don't want you disgracing yourself.
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:31.820]   Why not?
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:32.820]   Because I like you.
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.440]   I think you're great.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.640]   And you're not going to act like a bloody fool in public so that people get the wrong
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.120]   idea about you.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   No.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.600]   What about inside a relationship?
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:49.480]   A successful relationship, how much challenge, how much peace?
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:57.500]   Is a successful relationship one that is easy or one that is challenging?
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.320]   I would say to some degree that depends on your temperament.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.460]   My wife is quite a provocative person.
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:11.220]   And there are times when I, I suppose, do I wish that, there are times when I casually
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:15.440]   wish that she was easier to get along with, but as soon as I think about it, I don't,
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.640]   I don't think that.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   Cause I've, I've always liked her.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.760]   We were friends ever since we were little kids and she's, she plays rough.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:25.200]   And I like that as it turns out.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:29.960]   Now that doesn't mean it isn't a pain from time to time, but you know, and that is going
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:36.000]   to be a temperamental issue to some degree and, and an issue of negotiation, like she
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.960]   plays rough, but fair and the fair part has been establishing that's been part of our
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.300]   ongoing negotiation.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:48.440]   And part of it is in the play, you get to find out about yourself or what your temperament
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   is.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.680]   Cause I don't think that that's clear until it's tested.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.360]   Oh, definitely not.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.360]   Definitely not.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.120]   You find out all sorts of things about yourself in a relationship.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120]   That's for sure.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:03.900]   Well, and partly the reason that there is provocativeness, especially from women in relationship to men
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.760]   is they want to test them out.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.440]   It's like, can you hold your temper when someone's bothering you?
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.440]   Well, why would a woman want to know that?
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:16.160]   Well, maybe she doesn't want you to snap and hurt her kids.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.360]   And so how is she going to find that out?
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   Ask you?
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.040]   Well, you're going to say, well, I'd never do that.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:26.280]   It's like never a let's find out if it's never.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.400]   So we don't know how people test each other out in relationships, but, or why exactly,
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.380]   but it's intense and necessary.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:39.420]   What's your, and what's in general should a man's relationship with temper be?
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:43.120]   You should have one and you should be able to regulate it.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.580]   Like that's part of that attractiveness of the monstrous that characterizes women's fantasies.
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.580]   Right?
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.660]   Because, and Nietzsche pointed this out too, go back to Nietzsche, you know, Nietzsche,
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:58.620]   one of Nietzsche's claims was that most of what passes for morality is nothing but cowardice.
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:00.620]   You know, I'd never cheat on my wife.
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:06.500]   It's like, uh, is there anybody asking you to, that you actually find attractive?
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.900]   Or are there dozens of people asking you to, that you find attractive?
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.420]   It's like, well, I would never cheat.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.700]   It's like, no, you just don't have the opportunity.
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:17.620]   Now I don't, I'm not saying that everyone's in that position, you know, that they would
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:20.260]   cheat even if they had the opportunity, because that's not true.
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:25.260]   But, and it's the same with regards to, oh, I'm a peaceful man.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:26.260]   It's like, no, you're not.
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:27.900]   You're just a weak coward.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:32.480]   You wouldn't dare have it, to have a confrontation, physical or metaphysical.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.660]   And you're passing it off as morality because you don't want to come to terms with the fact
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:38.540]   of your own weakness and cowardice.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:44.500]   And part of the, that, what I would say is twisted pseudo-Christian morality that Nietzsche
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:49.140]   was criticizing was exactly of that sort, and it tied into resentment and envy.
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:57.280]   And he tied that in explicitly, said that failure in life, masked by the morality that's
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:03.540]   nothing but weak cowardice, turns to the resentment that undermines and destroys everything, and
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.540]   that does that purposefully.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:10.660]   I think he was criticizing if under the facade of niceness, there's an ocean of resentment.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.580]   Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.580]   That's for sure.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:18.420]   That's also the danger of being too forthcoming with people.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:21.940]   See, this is another thing, let's say, about my wife, who's not particularly agreeable.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:26.620]   It's like, she's not particularly agreeable, but she's not resentful.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:30.960]   And that's because she doesn't give things away that she isn't willing to.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.180]   And if you're agreeable and nice and you're conflict avoidant, you'll push yourself too
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.460]   far to please the other person.
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.580]   And then that makes you bitter and resentful.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:40.580]   So that's not helpful.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:44.500]   Do you think you'll be in trouble for saying this on a podcast later?
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:47.820]   No, no, we know each other pretty well.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:52.040]   And like I said, it's not, it's a trait that I find admirable.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.580]   It's provocative and challenging.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:56.700]   And it seems to work.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:00.020]   Well, we've been together 50 years, so...
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.180]   Quick pause, bathroom break.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:10.340]   If we can descend from the realm of ideas down to history and reality, I would say the
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:19.860]   time between World War I and World War II was one of history's biggest testing of ideas.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:27.980]   And really the most dramatic kinds of ideas that helped us understand the nature of good
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:28.980]   and evil.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:35.020]   I just want to ask you sort of a question about good and evil.
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:40.980]   Churchill, in many ways, was not a good man.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:46.860]   Stalin, as you've documented extensively, was a horrible man.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:54.860]   But you can make the case that both were necessary for stopping an even worse human being in
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:56.300]   Hitler.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:03.140]   So to what degree do you need monsters to fight monsters?
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:12.500]   Do you need bad men to be able to fight off greater evils?
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.380]   It's everything in its proper place is the answer to that.
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:20.540]   You know, we might think that our life would be easier without fear, let's say.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:24.140]   We might say that our life would be easier without anger or pain.
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:28.860]   But the truth of the matter is, is that those things are beneficial, even though they can
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:32.340]   cause great suffering, but they have to be in their proper place.
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:37.700]   And that capacity that could in one context be a terrible force for evil, can in the proper
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:41.500]   context be the most potent force for good.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.180]   A good man has to be formidable.
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:50.300]   And partly what that means, as far as I can tell, is that you have to be able to say no.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.020]   And no means...
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:57.860]   I thought a lot about no, working as a clinician, because I did a lot of strategic counseling
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.940]   with my clients in a lot of extremely difficult situations.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.020]   And I learned to take apart what no meant.
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:08.820]   And also when dealing with my own children, because I used no sparingly, because it's
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:11.100]   a powerful weapon, let's say.
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.260]   But I meant it.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.500]   And with my kids, what it meant was, if you continue that pattern of behavior, something
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:21.140]   you do not like will happen to you with 100% certainty.
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:27.020]   And when that's the case, and you're willing to implement it, you don't have to do it very
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.020]   often.
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:33.740]   With regards to monstrosity, it's like, weak men aren't good.
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:34.740]   They're just weak.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:35.820]   That's Nietzsche's observation.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:42.060]   That's partly, again, why he was tempted to place the will to power, let's say.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:47.540]   And to deal with that notion in a manner that, when it was tied with the revaluation of all
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:50.540]   values, was counterproductive.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.540]   Counterproductive in the final analysis.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:58.180]   It's not like there wasn't something to what he was driving at.
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:00.080]   Formidable men are admirable.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.300]   And you know, don't mess with them.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.380]   Douglas Murray's a good example of that.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:10.380]   He's, you know, he's a rather slight guy, but he's got a spine of steel.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.780]   And there's no more than a bit of what's a monstrous in him.
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:17.900]   And Jocko Willink is like that, and Joe Rogan is like that, and you're like that.
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:19.180]   But there's a different level.
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:26.020]   I mean, if you look, to me, Churchill might represent the thing you're talking about.
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:31.740]   But World War II, Hitler would not be stopped without Stalin.
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:34.280]   Well I wonder, yes, yes.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:42.060]   And if I may insert into this picture of complexity, Hitler would have not stopped until he enslaved
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:45.720]   and exterminated the entirety of the Slavic people.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.320]   The Jewish people, the Slavic people, the gypsies, everybody who is non-Aryan.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:56.980]   But then Stalin in the mass rape of German women by the Red Army as they marched towards
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:02.940]   Berlin is a kind of manifestation, the full monstrosity that a person can be.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:05.540]   You can easily be in this situation.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:10.100]   You can easily and unfortunately find yourself in a situation where all you have in front
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:12.460]   of you are a variety of bad options.
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:17.380]   You know, that's partly why, if you have any sense, you try to conduct yourself very carefully
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:22.480]   in life, because you don't want to be in a position where you've made so many mistakes
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.760]   that all the options left to you are terrible.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:30.060]   And so you said, well, was it necessary to ally with Stalin?
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:35.860]   It's like, well, it's very difficult to second guess the trajectory of something as complex
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:36.940]   as World War II.
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:42.780]   But we could say casually, at least as Westerners have in general, that that alliance was necessary.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:49.780]   Now, I think the mistake that the West made in the aftermath of World War II was in not
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:54.800]   dealing as forthrightly with the catastrophes of communism as an ideology, as we did with
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.200]   fascism.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:59.220]   And that's especially true of the intellectuals in the universities.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:04.940]   I mean, it was very common when I was teaching both at Harvard and at the University of Toronto
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:09.860]   for the students in my personality class, where we studied Solzhenitsyn, who's actually
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:14.720]   an existential psychologist in many ways, and a deep one, none of them knew anything
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.860]   about the Soviet atrocities.
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:21.700]   None of them knew anything about what happened in Ukraine and the death of six million productive
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:22.700]   people.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:28.440]   They had no idea that the communists killed tens of millions of people in the aftermath
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.100]   of the Russian Revolution.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:33.260]   They know even less about Mao and the Great Leap Forward.
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:34.260]   Yeah, right.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:35.260]   Right.
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.800]   Which some estimates are a hundred million people.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:42.500]   Now, you know, when your error bars are in the tens of millions, well, that's a real
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.020]   indication of a cataclysm.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:47.940]   And nobody knows how many people died from direct oppression or indirect in the Soviet
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:48.940]   Union.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:52.020]   20 million, it seems like a reasonable estimate.
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.300]   Solzhenitsyn's upper bound was higher than that.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:31:02.980]   And how do you measure the intellectual output that was suppressed and killed off, the number
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:06.360]   of intellectuals, artists and writers that were put into the gulags?
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.400]   Well, and productive farmers, for that matter, and anyone who was willing to tell the truth.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.840]   Right, absolutely.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.480]   So, yeah, catastrophic.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.480]   And so I think the West's failure wasn't so much allying with Stalin.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:23.320]   I mean, it was Douglas MacArthur who wanted to continue.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.240]   He thought we should just take the Soviets out after the Second World War.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:33.040]   And they removed them from any position of authority where such a thing might be made
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.240]   possible.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.560]   And people were tired.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.800]   But was MacArthur wrong?
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:45.600]   Well, he certainly wasn't wrong in his insistence that Stalin was as big a monster as Hitler
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.040]   or bigger.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:54.720]   So the valorization of the leftist proclivity, the radical leftist proclivity, is the sin
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:00.120]   of the West, I think more intensely than allying with Stalin.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:05.520]   Tricky nuanced topic, but if we look at the modern day and the threat of communism, Marxism
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:14.160]   in the United States, to me, it's disrespectful to the atrocities of the 20th century to call
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:18.800]   somebody like Kamala Harris a communist.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:24.760]   But I see the sort of escalation of the extremeness of language being used.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.960]   When you call somebody like Donald Trump a fascist, then it makes total sense to then
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.360]   use similar extreme terminology for somebody like Kamala Harris.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.320]   But maybe I could ask your evaluation.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:40.720]   If you look at the political landscape today, somebody like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris—
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:45.120]   Well, the first thing I would say is that I think that viewing the political landscape
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:49.000]   of today as a political landscape is actually wrong.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.160]   I think it's not the right frame of reference.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:33:00.000]   Because what I see happening are a very small percentage of dark tetrad personality types,
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:07.960]   so Machiavellian, manipulative, narcissistic, wanting undeserved attention, psychopathic,
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:14.040]   that makes them predatory parasites, and sadistic, because that goes along with the other three.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:21.160]   That's about, in the serious manifestation, that's probably 3-5% of the population.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:28.480]   And they're generally kept under pretty decent control by civilized people and stable social
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.480]   interactions.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:39.520]   But I think that their machinations are disinhibited by cost-free social media communication.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.560]   So they gain disproportionate influence.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:47.000]   Now these people want undeserved recognition and social status and everything that goes
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.920]   along with it, and they don't care how they get it.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:56.440]   Because when I say they want that, I mean that's all they want.
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:02.760]   So in the realm of social media, you mentioned, yes, but are you also suggesting that they're
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.240]   over-represented in the realm of politics, politicians, and so on?
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.880]   They're over-represented in the realm of fractious political discourse, because they can use
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:12.880]   ideas.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.840]   First of all, they can use, let's say, the benevolent ideas of the right and the benevolent
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.960]   ideas of the left, either one, and switch back and forth, for that matter, as a camouflage
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.200]   for what they're actually up to.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.800]   So how do you, you've interviewed a lot of people, and you have a really powerful mind,
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.920]   you have a good read on people.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.040]   So how do you know when you're sitting across from a psychopath?
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.840]   I wouldn't say that I do know.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.160]   In normal social circumstances, we have evolved mechanisms to keep people like that under
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.160]   control.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:45.600]   Let's say that you and I have a series of interactions, and you screw me over once.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.880]   I'm not going to forget that.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.840]   Now I might not write you off because of the one time, but if it happens three times, it's
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.760]   like, we're not going to play together anymore.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:01.760]   And in normal times, most of our social networks are connected and interacting.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:09.200]   So if you rip me off three times, and I noted that, I'm going to tell everybody I know,
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.360]   and they're going to tell everybody they know, and soon everyone will know, and that's the
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.080]   end of your tricks.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:18.240]   But that assumes that we know who you are, and we're in continual communication.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:21.320]   Well, all of that's gone online.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:34.200]   So anonymity does that, and so does the amplification of emotional intensity by the social media
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.740]   platforms and their algorithms.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:41.720]   I think what we're doing—this is happening on Twitter continually—is we're giving the
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.960]   5% of psychopaths a radically disproportionate voice.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.280]   And what they're doing is, there's a bunch of them on the left, and they're all, "We're
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:52.840]   so compassionate," and there's a bunch of them on the right, and at the moment, they're
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:55.400]   all, "We're so Christian and free-speech-oriented."
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.640]   It's like, no, you're not.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:00.440]   You're a narcissistic psychopath, and that's your camouflage.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:08.080]   And you hide behind your anonymity, and you use fractious and divisive language to attract
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:13.480]   fools and to elevate your social status and your clout.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.920]   And not only that, to gain, what would you say, satisfaction for your sadistic impulses.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:29.240]   See, the problem is, it's hard to tell who's the psychopath and who is a heterodox truth-seeker.
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:34.840]   Yeah, well, if you were charitable about Tucker Carlson's recent interview, you'd say that
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:37.400]   was exactly the conundrum he faced.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.400]   And it is hard.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.060]   Like, I've thought about, for example, interviewing Andrew Tate.
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:43.800]   And I thought, "I don't think so."
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.560]   And then I thought, "Why?"
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:50.980]   I figured, "It's not obvious to me at all that he wouldn't charm me."
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:53.480]   So I knew this guy, Robert Hare.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:58.460]   Robert Hare was the world's foremost authority on psychopathy.
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:04.160]   He established the field of clinical analysis of psychopathic behavior.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.400]   And Hare was a pretty agreeable guy, so he would give people the benefit of the doubt.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:13.520]   And he interviewed hundreds of serious psychopaths, like imprisoned violent offenders.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:19.640]   And he told me, in one of our conversations, that every time he sat down with a violent
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:24.760]   offender psychopath, and he had a measure for psychopathy that was a clinical checklist,
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:30.760]   so he could identify the psychopaths from just the, say, run-of-the-mill criminals.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.560]   Every time he sat down with them, they pulled the wool over his eyes, and he videotaped
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.560]   the interviews.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.080]   And it wasn't until later, when he was reviewing the videos, that he could see what they were
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.080]   doing.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:47.080]   But in person, their tricks were more sophisticated than his detection ability.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.840]   Well, okay, this is fascinating, because, again, you're a great interviewer.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.000]   I would love it if you interviewed somebody like Putin.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.200]   So this idea that you are a fool in the face of psychopathy just doesn't jive with me.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.760]   I'm an agreeable guy.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:02.760]   That's the problem.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.400]   You give people the benefit of the doubt, right, right.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:10.680]   But that's good, because the way you reveal psychopathy is by being agreeable.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:16.960]   Not weak, but seeking with empathy to understand the other person.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:25.320]   And in the details, in the little nuanced ways that they struggle with questions, the
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.320]   psychopathy is revealed.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320]   So from a...
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.320]   We're kind of...
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.320]   Just to separate the two things.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:36.160]   You know, over-representation of psychopathy online, with anonymity, that's a serious fascinating
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.160]   problem.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:43.280]   But in the interview, one-on-one, I don't know if the job of a human being in conversation
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.480]   is to not talk to psychopaths, but to talk...
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:49.640]   I mean, like, how would you interview Hitler?
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:55.360]   Well, you know, I've had very difficult clinical interviews with people in my clinical practice.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.680]   So how do you approach that?
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:01.880]   Well, I really probably approach that the way I approach most conversations.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:07.900]   And it's something like, I'm going to assume that you're playing a straight game, but I'm
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:09.160]   going to watch.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:14.320]   And if you throw in the odd crooked maneuver in, then I'll note it.
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:18.720]   And after you do it three times, I'll think, okay, I see.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.960]   I thought we were playing one game, but we're actually playing another one.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:27.520]   And if I'm smart enough to pick that up, that usually works out quite successfully for me.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.040]   But I'm not always smart enough to pick that up.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:34.580]   But see, here's the nice thing, there's a one-on-one conversation that's not recorded,
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:37.760]   is different than one that's listened by a lot of people.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:43.240]   Because I would venture, I trust the intelligence of the viewer and the listener to detect even
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.600]   better than you.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.600]   Yes.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.840]   And I think that's true, by the way.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.840]   To detect the psychopathy.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:54.560]   I've had the odd interview with people that I wasn't happy with having organized.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:02.080]   Because I felt that I had brought their ideas to a wider audience than might've been appropriate.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.180]   But my conclusion and the conclusion of my producers and the people I talked to was that
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:11.960]   we could run the interview, the discussion and let the audience sort it out.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.200]   And I would say they do.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.080]   So I think as a general rule of thumb, that's true.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.040]   And I also think that the long form interviews are particularly good at that because it's
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:29.700]   not that easy to maintain a manipulative stance, especially if you're empty for like two and
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:30.700]   a half hours.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.700]   Yes.
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:35.840]   So you get tired, you get irritable, you show that you lose the track, you're going to start
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:38.200]   leaking out your mistakes.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:39.200]   And so...
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:44.240]   And that actually is the case for all the world leaders, I would say.
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.920]   One hour is too short.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:51.080]   Something happens at like two hour plus mark where you start to leak.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.920]   And I trust in the intelligence of the listener to sort of detect that.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.760]   And it might be the intelligence of the distributed crowd.
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:05.480]   And I mean, that is what I've seen with the YouTube interviews is that it's hard to fool
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.520]   people as such over a protracted period of time.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:14.720]   And I guess it's partly because everybody brings a different, slightly different set
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.520]   of falsehood detectors to the table.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.600]   And if you aggregate that, it's pretty damn accurate.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:28.000]   But of course, it's complicated because ideas of Nazi ideology spread in the 20s.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.480]   There was a real battle between Marxism and Nazism.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480]   Oh yeah.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:36.660]   And I believe there's some attempts at censorship of Nazi ideology.
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:39.180]   Censorship very often does the opposite.
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:48.000]   It gives the fringe ideologies power if they're being censored, because that's an indication
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.340]   that the man in power doesn't want the truth to be heard, this kind of idea.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.740]   And that just puts fuel to the fire.
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:03.000]   It also motivates the paranoid types, because one of the reasons that paranoia spirals out
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.700]   of control is because paranoid people almost inevitably end up being persecuted.
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:14.960]   Because they're so touchy and so suspicious that people start to walk on eggshells around
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.420]   them as if there are things going on behind the scenes.
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:22.100]   And so then they get more distrustful and more paranoid, and eventually they start misbehaving
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:27.220]   so badly that they are actually persecuted, often by legal authorities, and it's down
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.120]   the rabbit hole they go.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:32.100]   And so Musk is betting on that to some degree.
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:41.580]   He believes that free expression on Twitter X will sort itself out and be of net benefit.
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:48.020]   And I follow a lot of really bad accounts on X, because I like to keep an eye on the
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:52.460]   pathology of the left, let's say, and the pathology of the right, thinking at least
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:57.700]   in my clinical way that I'm watching the psychopaths dance around and try to do their subversion.
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:00.480]   And it's an ugly place to inhabit, that's for sure.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:07.260]   But it's also the case that a very tiny minority of seriously bad actors can have a disproportionate
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:08.260]   influence.
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:13.460]   And one of the things I've always hoped for for social media channels is that they separate
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.620]   the anonymous accounts from the verified accounts.
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:18.820]   They should just be in different categories.
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:25.380]   People who will say what they think and take the hits to their reputation.
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:28.740]   Anonymous types, if you want to see what the anonymous types say, you can see it, but don't
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:32.160]   be confusing them with actual people, because they're not the same.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.060]   We know that people behave more badly when they're anonymous.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.220]   That's a very well-established psychological finding.
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:41.740]   Well, and I think the danger to our culture is substantive.
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:46.540]   I think the reason that everything, perhaps, the reason that everything started to go sideways
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:52.400]   pretty seriously around 2015 is because we invented these new modes of communication.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.140]   We have no idea how to police them.
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:58.900]   And so the psychopathic manipulators, they have free reign.
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:02.020]   About 30% of the Internet is pornography.
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:05.460]   A huge amount of Internet traffic is outright criminal.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:10.220]   And there's a penumbra around that that's, you know, psychopathic, narcissistic, troublemaking
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:11.460]   trolls.
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:14.820]   And that might constitute the bulk of the interactions online.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:17.280]   And it's partly because people can't be held responsible.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.980]   So the free riders have free reign.
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:26.460]   It's a fascinating technical challenge of how to make our society resilient to the psychopaths
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.300]   on the left and the right.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:33.420]   It might be the fundamental problem of the age, given the amplification of communication
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:36.180]   by our social networks.
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:42.620]   And so to generalize across psychopaths, you could also think about bots, which behave
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:46.780]   similar to psychopaths in their certainty and not caring.
[01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.220]   They're maximizing some function.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.580]   They're not caring about anything else.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:52.580]   Short-term attention, even worse.
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.100]   Because you might, you know, that's another problem, eh?
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:45:00.660]   Like if the algorithms are maximizing for the grip of short-term attention, they're
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:03.740]   acting like immature agents of attention, right?
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:10.500]   And so then imagine the worst case scenario is negative emotion garners more attention.
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:13.820]   And short-term gratification garners more attention.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:19.260]   So then you're maximizing for the grip of short-term attention by negative emotion.
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:22.660]   I mean, that's not going to be a principle.
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:28.380]   If we were talking earlier about, you know, unsustainable unifying axioms.
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:32.220]   That's definitely, that's definitely one of them.
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:37.420]   Maximize for the spread of negative attention, negative emotion that garner short-term attention.
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:38.420]   Jesus.
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:39.420]   Brutal.
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:45.500]   I just, I tend to not think there's that many psychopaths.
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:50.660]   So maybe to push back a little bit, it feels like there's a small number of psychopaths.
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:54.740]   Three to 5% is the estimate worldwide.
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:55.740]   In terms of humans.
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:56.740]   Yeah.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:57.740]   Sure.
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:01.420]   But in terms of the pattern of stuff we see online, my hope is that a lot of people on
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:07.740]   the extreme left and extreme right, or just the trolls in general, are just young people
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:13.260]   kind of going through the similar stuff that we've been talking about, trying on the cynicism
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:15.180]   and the resentment.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:17.540]   There is, there's a drug aspect to it.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:20.700]   There's a pull to that.
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:23.660]   To talk shit about somebody, to take somebody down.
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:27.020]   I mean, there is some pleasure in that.
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:30.200]   There's a dark pull towards that.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.200]   And I think...
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.200]   That's the sadistic pull.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.900]   And I think a lot of people, I mean, you see, when you say sadistic, it makes it sound like
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.700]   some kind of, it's a pathology.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.740]   It's pleasure in the suffering of others.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.740]   Right.
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:45.460]   And I just think that all of us have the capacity for that.
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.420]   All humans have the capacity for that.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:49.580]   Some more than others, but everyone to some degree.
[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:54.460]   And when you're young, you don't understand the full implications of that on your own
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:55.460]   self.
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:59.900]   So if you participate in taking other people down, that's going to have a cost on your
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.060]   own development as a human being.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:03.060]   Definitely.
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:07.340]   Like it's going to take you towards a Dostoevsky's notes from underground, in the basement, cynical,
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:08.340]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.340]   Alone.
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:11.340]   And I think a lot of young people try it out.
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:15.220]   The reason is you get older and older, you realize that there's a huge cost to that so
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.220]   you don't do it.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.220]   But there's young people that...
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:22.260]   So I would like to sort of believe and hope that a large number of people who are trolls
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:24.460]   are just trying out the derision.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.460]   No doubt.
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:29.060]   And then so they can be saved.
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.060]   They can be helped.
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:36.660]   They can be shown that there's more growth, there's more flourishing to celebrating other
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:37.660]   people.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:43.660]   And criticizing ideas, but not in the way of derision, LOL, but by formulating your
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:49.300]   own self in the world, by formulating your ideas in a strong, powerful way, and also
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:54.980]   removing the cloak of anonymity and just standing behind your ideas and carrying the responsibility
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:55.980]   of those ideas.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:57.980]   I think all of that is right.
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:02.380]   I think the idea that that's more likely to occur among young people, that's clear.
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:05.160]   People as they mature, get more agreeable and conscientious.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.540]   We actually know that what you said is true technically.
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:12.600]   It's definitely the case that there is an innate tilt towards pleasure in that sort
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.540]   of behavior, and it is associated to some degree with dominant striving.
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:21.900]   And I do think it's true, as you pointed out, that many of the people who are toying with
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:25.860]   that pattern can be socialized out of it.
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:29.000]   In fact, maybe most people.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.180]   Even the repeat criminal types tend to desist in their late 20s.
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:39.300]   So imagine that 1% of the criminals commit 65% of the crimes.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:43.340]   So imagine that that 1% are the people that you're really concerned with.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:52.340]   They often have stable patterns of offending that emerged very young, like even in infancy,
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:56.660]   and continued through adolescence and into adulthood.
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:49:01.940]   If you keep them in prison until they're in the middle of their late 20s, most of them
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:02.940]   stop.
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:08.980]   And maybe the easiest way to understand that might just be delayed maturation.
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:12.780]   So are most people salvageable?
[01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:15.100]   Yes, definitely.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.740]   Is everyone salvageable?
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:21.700]   Well, at some point it becomes, first of all, they have to want to be salvaged.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.700]   That's a problem.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:27.780]   But then it also becomes something like, well, how much resources are you going to devote
[01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:29.580]   to that?
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:34.340]   Like the farther down the rabbit hole you've gone, the more energy it takes to haul you
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:35.340]   up.
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:39.580]   So there comes a point where the probability that you'll be able to get enough resources
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:44.740]   devoted to you to rescue you from the pit of hell that you've dug is zero.
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:46.060]   And that's a very sad thing.
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:50.580]   And it's very hard to be around someone who's in that situation, very, very hard.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:56.460]   And it seems that it's more likely that the leaders of movements are going to be psychopaths
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:01.620]   and the followers of movements are going to be the people that we're mentioning that have
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:05.580]   kind of lost themselves to the ideology of the movement.
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:11.540]   Well, we know that what you said is true, even historically, to a large degree, because
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:14.900]   Germany was successfully denazified.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:19.420]   And it's not like everybody who participated in every element of the Nazi movement was
[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:22.240]   brought to justice, not in the least.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.500]   The same thing happened in Japan.
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:30.340]   So to some degree, the same thing happened in South Africa, right?
[01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:36.620]   And so, and it's the case, for example, also in the stories that we were referring to earlier,
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:41.080]   the biblical stories, the patriarchs of the Bible, most of them are pretty bad people
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:42.420]   when they first start out.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:46.020]   Like Jacob's a really good, Jacob is the one who becomes Israel.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:49.420]   He's a major player in the biblical narrative.
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:52.260]   And he's a pretty bad actor when he first starts out.
[01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:54.220]   He's a mama's boy.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:56.740]   He's a liar.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:01.140]   He steals from his own brother, and in a major way, he deceives his father.
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:05.500]   He's a coward, you know, and yet he turns his life around.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:11.260]   So be careful the leaders you idolize and worship.
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:15.060]   But then it's not always clear to know who is the good and who's the evil.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.060]   Yeah.
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:17.320]   It's hard.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:21.700]   You have been through some dark places in your mind over your life.
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:26.020]   What have been some of your darker hours, and how did you find the light?
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:34.500]   Well, I would say I started contending with the problem of evil very young, 13 or 14.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:47.020]   And that's been the main, that was my main motivation of study for 30 years, I guess,
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.860]   something like that.
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:54.740]   At the end of that 30 years, it became more and more, I became more and more interested
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:57.540]   in fleshing out the alternative.
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:06.360]   Once I became convinced that evil existed, that was very young, I always believed that
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:10.980]   if you could understand something well enough, that you could formulate a solution to it.
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:20.940]   But it turns out that seeing evil and understanding that it exists is less complicated than a
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:24.560]   technical description of its opposite.
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:27.240]   What is good?
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.000]   You can say, well, it's not that, for sure.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000]   It's not Auschwitz.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.820]   How about we start there?
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:35.060]   It's as far from Auschwitz as you can get.
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:38.780]   It's as far from enjoying being an Auschwitz camp guard as you can get.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:43.860]   Well, where are you when you're as far away from that as you could possibly get?
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:45.620]   What does that mean?
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:49.340]   And it does have something to do with play, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:54.460]   Like I think the antithesis of tyranny is play.
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:59.580]   So that took me a long time to figure out that specifically, you know.
[01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:00.860]   And so that was very dark.
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:10.100]   I spent a lot of time studying the worst behaviors that I could discover abstractly in books,
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:15.020]   but also in my clinical practice and in my observations of people.
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.920]   And so that's rough.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:24.820]   More recently, I was very ill and in a tremendous amount of pain that lasted pretty much without
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:27.420]   any break for three years.
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:35.780]   And what was particularly useful to me then was the strength of my relationships, my immediate
[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:38.380]   relationships, my friendships.
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:45.680]   Also the relationships that I had established more broadly with people, you know.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:52.260]   Because by the time I became ill, I was reasonably well known and people were very supportive
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.740]   when I was having trouble, and that was very helpful.
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:54:00.940]   But it's certainly the case that it was the connections I had, particularly with my family,
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:04.140]   but also with my friends, that were the saving grace.
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:07.340]   And that's something to know, you know, I mean.
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:11.900]   It's necessary to bear the burdens of the world on your own shoulders, that's for sure.
[01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:15.620]   The burdens of your own existence and whatever other responsibilities you can mount.
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:20.940]   But that by no means means that you can or should do it alone.
[01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:29.600]   And so, you know, you might say, well, welcoming the adversity of life as a redemptive challenge
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:35.740]   is a task that's beyond the ability of the typical person or even maybe of anyone.
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:39.540]   But then when you think, well, you're not alone.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:44.020]   Maybe you're not alone socially, you're not alone familial, maybe you're not alone metaphysically
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.020]   as well.
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:50.100]   You know, there's an insistence, and I think it's true, there's an insistence, for example,
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:55.740]   in the Old and the New Testament alike, that the more darkness you're willing to voluntarily
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:00.700]   encounter, the more likely it is that the spirit of Abraham and the patriarchs will
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.300]   walk with you.
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:04.300]   And I think that's right.
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:10.820]   I think it's sort of technically true in that the best parts of yourself make themselves manifest.
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:14.700]   If you want to think about it that way, the best parts of yourself, whatever that means,
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:20.620]   make themselves manifest when you're contending actively and voluntarily with the most difficult
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:21.620]   challenges.
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:23.140]   Why wouldn't it be that way?
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:25.300]   And then you could think, well, that's yourself.
[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:30.580]   It's like, well, are the best unrevealed parts of you yourself?
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:35.660]   Well, no, they're a kind of metaphysical reality.
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:36.900]   They're not yet manifest.
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:38.820]   They only exist in potential.
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:42.980]   They transcend anything you're currently capable of, but they have an existence.
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:48.520]   You could call that yourself, but like it was Jung's contention, for example, with regards
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:54.140]   to such terminology, that the reason we use the term self instead of God is because when
[01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:58.620]   God was dispensed with, let's say, by the processes Nietzsche described, we just found
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:02.740]   the same thing deep within the instinctive realm, let's say.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:05.820]   We found it at the bottom of the things instead of at the top.
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:08.140]   It's like, it doesn't matter.
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:10.500]   It doesn't matter fundamentally.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:13.860]   What matters is whether or not that's a reality.
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:20.700]   And I think it's the fundamental reality, because I do think that the deeper you delve
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:26.660]   into things, this is what happens to Moses when he encounters the burning bush.
[01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:28.880]   So Moses is just going about his life.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.080]   He's a shepherd.
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.220]   He's an adult.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.260]   He has wives.
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:33.260]   He has children.
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:34.300]   He has responsibilities.
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:37.140]   He's left his home and he's established himself.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:40.680]   And so things are pretty good for Moses.
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:44.760]   And then he's out by Mount Horeb in that story, but it's the central mountain of the world.
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:49.600]   It's the same mountain as Sinai, which is the place where heaven and earth touch.
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.180]   And he sees something that grabs his attention, right?
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:54.180]   That's the burning bush.
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:55.680]   And bush is a tree.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:56.680]   That's life.
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:57.680]   That's the tree of life.
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.080]   And the fact that it's on fire, that's life exaggerated, because everything that's alive
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:04.440]   is on fire.
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:09.100]   And so what calls to Moses is like the spirit of being itself, and it tracks him off the
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.180]   beaten track.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:12.720]   And he decides to go investigate.
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:16.980]   So Moses is everyone who goes off the beaten track to investigate.
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:24.620]   And so as he investigates, he delves more and more deeply until he starts to understand
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:27.480]   that he's now walking on sacred ground.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:33.620]   So he takes off his shoes, and that's a symbolic reference of identity transformation.
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:35.820]   He's no longer walking the same path.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:37.680]   He no longer has the same identity.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:39.460]   He's in a state of flux.
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:44.980]   And that's when what happens is that he continues to interact with this calling.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:51.480]   And Moses asks what it is that's being revealed, and God says, "I'm the spirit of being itself."
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:52.620]   That's basically the answer.
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:54.580]   I am what I am.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:56.780]   It's a more complex utterance than that.
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:58.900]   I am what I will be.
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:01.060]   I am what was becoming.
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:02.500]   It's all of that at the same time.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:06.280]   It's the spirit of being that's speaking to him, the spirit of being and becoming.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:12.920]   And it tells Moses that he now, because he's delved so deeply into something so compelling,
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:17.700]   his identity is transformed and he's become the leader who can speak truth to power.
[01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:22.020]   And so he allies himself with his brother Aaron, who's the political arm and who can
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:25.340]   communicate and he goes back to Egypt to confront the tyrant.
[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:32.460]   And that's an indication of that idea, that if you wrestle with life properly, that the
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:36.900]   spirit of being and becoming walks with you.
[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:40.840]   And it's like, how can that not be true?
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:45.380]   Because the contrary would be that there would be no growth in challenge.
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:51.140]   Well, you have to be infinitely nihilistic to believe that.
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:59:00.300]   It's obvious, but it's also just fascinating that hardship is the thing that ends up being
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:02.860]   the catalyst for delving deeply.
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:05.940]   It's hardship voluntarily undertaken.
[01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:07.100]   It's crucially true.
[01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:12.180]   Look, if you bring someone into therapy, let's say they're afraid of elevators and you trick
[01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:15.880]   them into getting near an elevator, you'll make them worse.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:23.000]   But if you negotiate with them so that they voluntarily move towards the elevator on their
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:30.360]   own recognizance, they'll overcome their fear and they become generally braver, but it has
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.360]   to be voluntary.
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:35.360]   See, I got to push back and explore with you the question of voluntarily.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.960]   Let's look at Nietzsche.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:41.520]   He suffered through several health issues throughout his life, migraines, eyesight issues,
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:48.120]   digestive problems, depression with suicidal thoughts, and yet he is one of the greatest
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:50.760]   minds in the history of humanity.
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:59.000]   So were these problems that he was suffering arguably involuntarily a feature or a bug?
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000]   That's a good question.
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.020]   The same thing happens in the story of Job, because Job is a good man.
[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:05.960]   God himself admits it.
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:12.960]   And Satan comes along and says to God, I see you're pretty proud of your man there, Job.
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.440]   God says, yeah, he's doing pretty well.
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:17.980]   And Satan says, I think it's just because things are easy for him.
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:20.100]   Let me have a crack at him and see what happens.
[02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:22.260]   And God says, yeah, I think you're wrong.
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:23.260]   Do your worst.
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:24.260]   Right?
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:29.120]   And that's how people feel when those slings and arrows come at them, let's say, like Nietzsche.
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:34.520]   Well, Job's response to that, now the story is set up so that what befalls Job is actually
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.920]   quite arbitrary, right, these catastrophes that you're describing.
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:43.160]   The volunteerism in Job is his refusal to despair even in the face of that adversity.
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.240]   And that seems like something like an expression of voluntary free will.
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.760]   He refuses to lose faith.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:54.120]   And the way the story ends is that Job gets everything back and more.
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:57.040]   And you know, so that's a descent and ascent story.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:01.160]   And a cynic might say, well, the ends don't justify the means.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.660]   And I would say, fair enough, but that's a pretty shallow interpretation of the story.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:12.280]   What it indicates instead is that if you're fortunate, because let's not forget that,
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:19.980]   and you optimize your attitude, even in the face of adversity, that it's not infrequently
[02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:22.460]   the case that your fortunes will reverse.
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:34.500]   You know, and I found that in many situations, the journalists whose goal was most malicious
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:43.220]   in relationship to me, who were most concerned with improving their own, what would you say,
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:48.500]   fostering their own notoriety and gaining social status at my expense, were the ones
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:51.300]   who did me the greatest favor.
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:54.100]   Those were the interviews that went viral.
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:58.260]   And so that's interesting, you know, because they were definitely the places where the
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:00.800]   most disaster was at hand.
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:02.460]   And I felt that in the aftermath.
[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:07.780]   Every time that happened, my whole family was destabilized for like two months because
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:13.860]   things, it wasn't obvious at all which way the dice were going to roll.
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:15.500]   But you leaned into that.
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:21.380]   So in a sense that there's this kind of transformation from the involuntary to the voluntary.
[02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:23.180]   Basically saying, bring it on.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:29.740]   That act of bring it on turns the involuntary hardship into voluntary hardship.
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:32.100]   Well not necessarily, let's say.
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:35.340]   But you could say that's your best bet.
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:43.140]   Well, you know, I'm never going to say that you can transcend all catastrophe with the
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:47.460]   right attitude, because that's just too much to say.
[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:54.340]   But I could say that in a dire situation, there's always an element of choice.
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:03:02.660]   And if you make the right choices, you improve the degree, you improve your chances of success
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:05.660]   to the maximal possible degree.
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:09.740]   It might be too much to say, but nevertheless, this could be true.
[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:14.140]   Viktor Frankl, Marcus Aurelius.
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:22.060]   Well that's what the resurrection story proclaims, is that even under the darkest imaginable circumstances,
[02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:27.540]   the fundamental finale is the victory of the good.
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:31.220]   And that seems to me to be true.
[02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:40.180]   Do you have regrets when you look back at your life in the full analysis of it?
[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:45.140]   Well as I said, I was very ill for about three years and it was seriously brutal.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:51.060]   Like every, this is no lie, every single minute of that three years was worse than any single
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:55.900]   time I'd ever experienced in my entire life up to that.
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:57.940]   So that was rough.
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:01.980]   Was the roughest the physical or the psychological?
[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:02.980]   Pain.
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:04.660]   Just literal pain?
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:05.660]   Yeah.
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:16.900]   Yeah, I was walking like 10 to 12 miles a day, rain or shine, winter, didn't matter.
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:18.060]   Not good.
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:29.060]   And it was worse than that because as the day progressed, my pain levels would fall
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:39.180]   until by 10, 11 at night when I was starting to get tired, I was approaching, what would
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:46.180]   you say, I was approaching something like an ordinary bad day.
[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:50.860]   But as soon as I went to sleep, then the clock was reset and all the pain came back.
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:57.260]   And so it wasn't just that I was in pain, it was that sleep itself became an enemy.
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:02.060]   And that's really rough, man, because sleep is where you take refuge, you know.
[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:07.780]   You're worn out, you're tired, and you go to sleep and you wake up and it's generally,
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:10.300]   it's something approximating a new day.
[02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:13.260]   This was like Sisyphus on steroids.
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:17.700]   And it was very difficult to maintain hope in that, because I would do what I could,
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:21.380]   like there were times when it took me like an hour and a half in the morning to stand
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:22.780]   up.
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:28.860]   And so I'd do all that and more or less put myself back into something remotely resembling
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:34.220]   human by the end of the day, and then I knew perfectly well, exhausted, if I fell asleep,
[02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:37.300]   that I was going to be right at the bottom of the bloody hill again.
[02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:44.380]   And so after a couple of years of that, it was definitely the fact that I had a family
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:46.060]   that carried me through that.
[02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:54.180]   What did you learn about yourself, about yourself and about the human mind from that, from all
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:55.180]   of those days?
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:06:00.680]   Well, I think I learned more gratitude for the people I had around me.
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:07.240]   And I learned how fortunate I was to have that and how crucial that was.
[02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:09.680]   My wife learned something similar.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:14.400]   She was diagnosed with a form of cancer that, as far as we know, killed every single person
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.640]   who ever had it except her.
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:19.260]   It's quite rare.
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:28.320]   And her experience was that what really gave her hope and played at least a role in saving
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:34.440]   her was the realization of the depth of love that her son in particular had for her.
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:37.760]   And that says nothing about her relationship with Michaela, with her daughter.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:45.720]   It just so happened that it was the revelation of that love that made Tammy understand the
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:51.400]   value of her life in a way that she wouldn't have realized of her own accord.
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:56.960]   We're very, very – there's no difference between ourselves and the people that we love.
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:01.040]   And there might be no difference between ourselves and everyone, everywhere, but we can at least
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:06.160]   realize that to begin with in the form of the people that we love.
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:08.720]   And I hope I'm better at that than I was.
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:12.560]   I think I'm better at it than I was.
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:19.360]   I'm a lot more grateful for just ordinariness than I was, because when I first recovered,
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:24.360]   I remember I was standing – first started to recover, I was standing in this pharmacy
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:28.440]   waiting for a prescription in a little town, and they weren't being particularly efficient
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.440]   about it.
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:36.000]   And I got standing in the aisle for like 20 minutes, and I thought, "I'm not on fire.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:42.160]   I could just stand here for like the rest of my life, just not being in pain and enjoying that."
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:46.560]   And, you know, that would have been something that before that would have been – you know,
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:50.360]   I would have been impatient and raring to go, because I didn't have 20 minutes to stand
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:52.360]   in the middle of an aisle.
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:56.040]   And I thought, "Well, you know, if you're just standing there and you're not on fire,
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:58.520]   things are a lot better than they might be."
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:04.400]   And I certainly – I know that, and I think I remember it almost all the time.
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:09.240]   You gain a greater ability to appreciate the mundane moments of life.
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:11.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.400]   The miracle of the mundane, right?
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:14.400]   Yeah.
[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:19.600]   I think Nietzsche had that, because he was very ill.
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:27.200]   And so I suspect he had – you know, and he was regarded by the inhabitants of the
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:32.240]   village that he lived in near the end of his life as something approximating a saint.
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:37.000]   He apparently conducted himself very admirably, despite all his suffering.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.920]   You know, but that's still – there's this tension, as there is in much of Nietzsche's
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:50.440]   work, between the miracle of the mundane – appreciating the miracle of the mundane versus fearing
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.720]   the tyranny of the mediocre.
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:55.520]   It's more the mediocre and resentful.
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:00.400]   Yes, but that's you giving him a pass, or seeing the good.
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:01.400]   Well, fair enough, you know.
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:07.400]   There's a kind of – I mean, the tyranny of the mediocre – I always hated this idea
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:09.720]   that some people are better than others.
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:12.960]   And I understand it, but it's a dangerous idea.
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.040]   This is why I like the story of Cain and Abel, I would say.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:23.120]   Because Cain is mediocre, but that's because he refuses to do his best.
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:24.600]   It's not something intrinsic to him.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:28.760]   And I actually think that's the right formulation, because, you know, I had people in my clinical
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:37.720]   practice who were – they were lost in many dimensions, from the perspective of comparison.
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:42.940]   One woman I remember in particular, who – man, she had a lot to contend with.
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:46.420]   She was not educated, she was not intelligent.
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:55.560]   She had a brutal family, like, terrible history of psychiatric hospitalization.
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:10:07.240]   And when I met her at a hospital, she was an outpatient from the psychiatric ward.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:11.200]   And she had been in there with people that she thought were worse off than her.
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:12.360]   And they were.
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:14.160]   And that was a long way down.
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:17.100]   That was like Dante's Inferno leveled down.
[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:21.260]   It was a long-term psychiatric inpatient ward.
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:24.280]   Some of the people had been there for 30 years.
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:31.160]   It made One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest look like a romantic comedy.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:36.160]   And she had come back to see if she could take some of those people for a walk, and
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.740]   was trying to find out how to get permission to do it.
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:47.360]   And so, you know, better than other people – some people are more intelligent, some
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:53.240]   people are more beautiful, some people are more athletic – maybe it's possible for
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:59.000]   everyone at all levels of attainment to strive towards the good.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.680]   And maybe those talents that are given to people unfairly don't privilege them in
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:05.760]   relationship to their moral conduct.
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:07.520]   And I think that's true.
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:10.920]   Like, there's no evidence, for example, that there's any correlation whatsoever
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:15.320]   between intelligence and morality.
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:17.440]   You're not better because you're smart.
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:21.960]   And what that also implies is if you're smart, you can be a lot better at being worse.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:30.960]   I think, for myself, I'm just afraid of dismissing people because of my perception
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.960]   of them.
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:35.560]   Yeah, well, that's why we have that metaphysical presumption that everybody's made in the
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:41.160]   image of God, right, despite that immense diversity of apparent ability.
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:48.800]   There's that underlying metaphysical assumption that, yeah, we all vary in our perceived and
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:54.520]   actual utility in relationship to any proximal goal, but all of that's independent of the
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:57.320]   question of axiomatic worth.
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:03.920]   And preposterous as that notion appears to be, it seems to me that societies that accept
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:08.760]   it as a fundamental axiomatic presumption are always the societies that you'd want
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:11.300]   to live in if you had a choice.
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:16.400]   And that, to me, is an existence proof for the utility of the presumption.
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.740]   And also, you know, if you treat people like that in your life, every encounter you have,
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:29.080]   you make the assumption that it's an assumption of, what would you, it's radical equality
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:33.440]   of worth despite individual variance in ability, something like that.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.920]   Man, your interactions go way better.
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:38.800]   I mean, everyone wants to be treated that way.
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:42.240]   Look, here's a developmental sequence for you.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:46.560]   Naive and trusting, hurt and cynical.
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:50.000]   Okay, well, is hurt and cynical better than naive and trusting?
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.120]   It's like, yeah, probably.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:54.320]   Is that where it ends?
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:59.920]   How about cynical and trusting as step three?
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:02.520]   Right, and then the trust becomes courage.
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:09.480]   Like, yeah, I'll put my hand out for you, but it's not because I'm a fool.
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:13.880]   And I think that's right, because that's the re-instantiation of that initial trust, right,
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:18.400]   that makes childhood magical and paradisal.
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:20.720]   But it's the admixture of that with wisdom.
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:27.360]   It's like, yeah, you know, we could be, we could walk together uphill, but that doesn't
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:31.560]   mean, and I'll presume that that's your aim.
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:35.040]   But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to watch.
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:42.720]   What's a better life, cynical and safe, or hopeful and vulnerable to be hurt?
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:46.400]   Oh, you can't dispense with vulnerable to be hurt.
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:47.560]   That's the other realization.
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:50.960]   It's like, you're going to stake your life on something.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:54.360]   You could stake your life on security, but it's not going to help.
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:55.960]   You don't have that option.
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:02.560]   So what do you do when you're betrayed, ultimately by some people you come across?
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:06.760]   Grieve and look elsewhere.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:14.080]   Do what you can to forgive, and not least so you lighten your own burden.
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:18.280]   Maybe do what you can to help the person who betrayed you.
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:27.320]   And if that all proves impossible, then wash your hands of it and move on to the next adventure.
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:29.040]   And do it again.
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:30.040]   Yeah.
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:31.040]   Yeah.
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:32.960]   Boy, this life.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:33.960]   Something else.
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:38.880]   So we've been talking about some heavy, difficult topics, and you've talked about truth in your
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:41.480]   Nietzsche lectures and elsewhere.
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:47.200]   When you think, when you write, when you speak, how do you find what is true?
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.960]   You know, Hemingway said, "All you have to do is write one true sentence."
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:51.960]   Yeah.
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:52.960]   How do you do that?
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:56.280]   Well, I would say first that you practice that.
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:02.200]   It's like, that question is something, and Hemingway knew this, at least to some degree,
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:08.320]   and he certainly wrote about it, is that you have to orient your life upward as completely
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:12.480]   as you can, because otherwise you can't distinguish between truth and falsehood.
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:14.040]   It has to be a practice.
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:20.400]   Now, and for me, I started to become serious about that practice when I realized that it
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:27.080]   was the immorality of the individual, the resentful, craven, deceitful immorality of
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:34.720]   the individual that led to the terrible atrocities that humans engage in that make us doubt even
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:35.720]   our own worth.
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:38.080]   I became completely convinced of that.
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:44.440]   That the fundamental root cause of evil, let's say, wasn't economic or sociological.
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:48.360]   That it was spiritual, just psychological.
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:54.640]   And that if that was the case, you had an existential responsibility to aim upward and
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:56.320]   to tell the truth.
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.680]   And that everything depends on that.
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:00.700]   And I became convinced of that.
[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:07.340]   And so then, look, you set your path with your orientation.
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:08.580]   That's how your perceptions work.
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:12.840]   As soon as you have a goal, a pathway opens up to you and you can see it.
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:17.600]   And the world divides itself into obstacles and things that move you forward.
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:20.300]   And so the pathway that's in front of you depends on your aim.
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:25.780]   The things you perceive are concretizations of your aim.
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:29.100]   If your aim is untrue, then you won't be able to tell the difference between truth
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:30.820]   and falsehood.
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:32.700]   And you might say, well, how do you know your aim is true?
[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:37.820]   It's like, well, you course-correct continually and you can aim towards the ultimate.
[02:16:37.820 --> 02:16:40.580]   Are you ever sure that your aim is the right direction?
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:44.980]   You become increasingly accurate in your apprehension.
[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:48.700]   Is it like part of the process to cross the line?
[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:52.980]   To go outside the Overton window, to dip a toe outside the Overton window for a bit?
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:53.980]   Of course.
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:59.180]   When I was in part in play, I was at the Comedy Mothership and every single comedian was like
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:01.380]   completely reprehensible.
[02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:04.660]   All they were doing was saying things that you can't say.
[02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:07.060]   Well, but it was in play.
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:10.380]   What I'm trying to do in my lectures is, I'm on the edge.
[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:12.860]   I have a question I'm trying to address and I'm trying to figure it out.
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:17.740]   I don't know where the conversation is going, truly.
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:18.880]   It's an exploration.
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.340]   And I think the reason that the audiences respond is because they can feel that.
[02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:24.300]   It's a high wire act, you know?
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:25.300]   And I could fail.
[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:28.460]   And, you know, my lectures have degrees of success.
[02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:30.820]   Sometimes I get real fortunate and there's a perfect narrative arc.
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:33.580]   I have a question, I'm investigating it.
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:37.620]   It comes to a punchline conclusion just at the right time and it's like the whole act
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:38.620]   is complete.
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:43.100]   And sometimes it's more fragmented, but I can tell when the audience is engaged because
[02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:47.300]   everyone's silent, you know, except maybe when they're laughing.
[02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:50.100]   There's a kind of sense that you're arguing with yourself when you're lecturing.
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:51.100]   It's beautiful.
[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:53.860]   It's really, really beautiful and powerful to watch, like Nietzsche does the same.
[02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:55.460]   There's contradictions in what you're saying.
[02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:57.040]   There's a struggle with what you're saying.
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:01.500]   But I do think that when you're doing the same on the internet, you get punished for
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:02.500]   the deviations.
[02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:07.900]   You get punished for the exploration, especially when that explores outside the Overton window.
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:15.020]   Look, if you're going to play hard in a conversation to explore, you're going to say things that
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.020]   are edgy, right?
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:18.720]   That are going to cause trouble and that might be wrong.
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:21.580]   And that's another reason why free speech protection is so important.
[02:18:21.580 --> 02:18:24.480]   You actually have to protect the right.
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:27.640]   Let's say in the optimal circumstance, you have to protect the right of well-meaning
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:29.200]   people to be wrong.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:33.000]   Now you probably have to go beyond that to truly protect it.
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.520]   You have to even protect the right of people who aren't meaning well to be wrong, you know,
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:41.420]   and we also need that because we're not always well-meaning.
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:45.440]   But I don't, you know, the alternative to that protection would be the insistence that
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:49.660]   people only say what was 100% right all the time.
[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:55.880]   I'm also, I guess this is a call to our fellow humans not to reduce a person to a particular
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:01.520]   statement, which is what the internet tends to want to do.
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.720]   Especially if it's the worst thing they ever said.
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:04.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:05.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:08.480]   Because God, well, anyone judged by that standard is doomed unless they're silent.
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:11.040]   But it also just makes you not want to play.
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:12.040]   Yeah, right.
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:16.520]   You don't want to take sort of radical thought experiments and carry out to a natural conclusion.
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.000]   Yeah, well, that's kind of the definition of a totalitarian state.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000]   Yes.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000]   No one's playing in a totalitarian state ever.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.320]   But in this case, it's an emergent one.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.320]   Yeah.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:27.520]   With psychopaths roaming the landscape.
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:28.520]   Yeah.
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:31.840]   Well, you know, that might be the general pattern of totalitarianism.
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:36.040]   Well, in totalitarianism, there's usually one psychopath, not multiple.
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:40.920]   Yeah, but everyone, well, everyone else is complicit, at least in their silence.
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:41.920]   Yeah.
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:46.160]   Does the study of the pathology of psychopaths online wear on you?
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.160]   Yes, definitely.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:51.520]   Do you ever consider doing less of that?
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:52.520]   Yes.
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:54.760]   Yes, definitely.
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:20:05.920]   But you know, probably I experience most of that on X.
[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:08.280]   But that's also where I find most of my guests.
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:13.360]   That's also where I get a sense of the zeitgeist, which is necessary.
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:17.280]   For example, if you're going to be a podcast host, it's necessary for me to make my lectures
[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:22.380]   on point and up to date to get a sampling of the current moment.
[02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:28.160]   You have to be of the moment in many ways to function at a high level.
[02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:29.160]   Is there a price?
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:35.880]   There's a price to be paid for that, because you're exposed to everything in a sense.
[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:38.520]   You can also oversample the darkness.
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:39.520]   Yeah.
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:40.520]   Yeah, definitely.
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:42.080]   And it can make you more and more cynical.
[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:43.080]   Yeah, well.
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:44.080]   It's a danger, right?
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:45.080]   Yeah.
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:46.080]   Yeah.
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:49.360]   Well, luckily for me, you know, I have many things that counterbalance that, the familial
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:54.480]   relationships we talked about, the friendships, and then also all of the public things I do
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:55.480]   are positive.
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:02.720]   The lecture tours, for example, which I'm on a lot, they're basically 100% positive.
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:09.040]   So I'm very well buttressed against that.
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:10.040]   That's great to hear.
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:11.040]   Darker element.
[02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:16.200]   As a fan in the arena watching the gladiators fight, your mind is too important to be lost
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:21.760]   to the cynical, to the battles with the abyss.
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:27.840]   Well, you have a moral obligation too, to maintain a positive orientation.
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:29.860]   It's a moral obligation.
[02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:34.640]   The future is, of course, rife with contradictory possibilities.
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:40.800]   And I suppose in some ways, the more rapid the rate of transformation, the more possibility
[02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:44.880]   for good and for evil is making itself manifest at any moment.
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:49.940]   But it looks like the best way to ensure that the future is everything we wish it would
[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:54.880]   be is to maintain faith that that is the direction that will prevail.
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:22:00.100]   And I think that's a form of moral commitment, when it's not just naive optimism.
[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:06.840]   Well, Jordan, thank you for being courageous and being the light amid the darkness for
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:08.740]   many, many people.
[02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:10.900]   And thank you for once again talking today.
[02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:13.500]   Thanks very much for the invitation and for the conversations.
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:19.340]   But it's always a pleasure to see you, and you're doing a pretty decent job yourself
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:24.620]   about there illuminating dark corners and bringing people upward.
[02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:28.700]   I mean, you've got a remarkable thing going with your podcast, and you're very good
[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:29.700]   at it.
[02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:30.700]   Thank you, Jordan.
[02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:33.460]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jordan Peterson.
[02:22:33.460 --> 02:22:37.920]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:42.020]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Friedrich Nietzsche.
[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:48.020]   I would like to learn more and more to see as beautiful that which is necessary in things.
[02:22:48.020 --> 02:22:52.860]   Then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful.
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:55.660]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:22:55.660 --> 02:22:56.660]   Bye.
[02:22:56.660 --> 02:22:57.660]   Bye.
[02:22:57.660 --> 02:22:58.660]   Bye.
[02:22:58.660 --> 02:22:58.660]   Bye.
[02:22:58.660 --> 02:22:59.660]   Bye.
[02:22:59.660 --> 02:23:00.660]   Bye.
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:01.660]   Bye.
[02:23:01.660 --> 02:23:01.660]   Bye.
[02:23:01.660 --> 02:23:11.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
