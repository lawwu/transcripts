[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   Let me give you one other example
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.420]   of how it really matters what platform you're using
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.060]   in terms of getting better results.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.520]   So, one site I've been using a lot more,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.920]   more for framing a question,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.760]   is this new AI search engine called Globe Explorer.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.040]   But the reason I like it is because it's highly visual.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.520]   So, all I searched here is electric bike brands.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.600]   You can see it up top.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.600]   And what it's done is basically grouped the information
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040]   in a helpful way where I can parse it.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.040]   It's almost like guiding me through the problem.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.640]   It's saying, okay, so you clearly wanna buy
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.680]   an electric bike.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.840]   Here are the major brands, but let me group them.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.000]   There's premium brands, there's mid-range brands,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.600]   there's budget brands, which to me, this visual nature
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.840]   and also kind of like the hierarchical subdivisions
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.140]   are so much more helpful than a Google, for example,
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.240]   which is just gonna give me 10 blue links.
