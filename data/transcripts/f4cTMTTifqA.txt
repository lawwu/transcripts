[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   So with no further ado, let's welcome Ron Lieber.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.260]   Welcome to the Vogelhead Speaker Series, Ron.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.260]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.040]   It is an honor here to be among, you know, sort of my fellow personal finance nerds.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.120]   I know there are few people, you know, living and walking and breathing in the United States
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.640]   or in the world who care more about beating the system, winning the details, and getting
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.920]   it right than this crew.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.120]   And it's a special honor to be here with Mr. Asset Allocation himself doing the grilling
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.200]   for the next 60 minutes.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.840]   So I look forward to it.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.160]   Lay it on me.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.660]   Well, Ron, we'll start out with you.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.080]   Over the past decade, your writing has shifted to focus on family finances, but particularly
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.400]   raising children, teaching children about money, and now sending those children to college.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.480]   So I think I can guess this, but what sparked your interest in doing a book on the price
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.200]   you paid for college?
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200]   Sure.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640]   Well, some of this is born of my own personal experience.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.800]   I grew up in Chicago.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.400]   You know, my family was well off enough to, you know, afford three private school tuitions,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.200]   you know, back in the day in the '70s and '80s when that didn't cost quite as much as
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.080]   it does today.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.960]   And I had a couple things happen in there that kind of changed everything for me.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.440]   So my parents split up.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.080]   If any of you are divorced or the children are divorced, you know that that is a calamitous
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.360]   financial event among others, right?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.080]   You take one household, you turn it into two, there are just going to be more expenses.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.280]   And then right about the same time, my father, my late father, lost his job, and he did not
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.080]   earn, you know, much income to speak of for the next couple of years, except through some
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   occasional consulting jobs.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.120]   And it was about a decade, really, until my family was back to where it had been financially.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.680]   So right away, we were sort of thrust into the, you know, private school financial aid
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.320]   system for K-12, such as it exists.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.080]   You know, it basically consisted of a board of directors at our school in Chicago deciding
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.040]   whether the leaver kids were going to be evicted for lack of ability to pay.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.500]   And thank God we weren't.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.920]   It's still the most generous thing that anybody's ever done for me.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.880]   And those kids who I grew up with, you know, became my family and are still my closest
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.920]   friends to this day.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.640]   So I got to stay there at the Francis Barker School.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.040]   But when it came time to apply to college, we did not have enough money for the places
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.000]   that I wanted to attend.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.760]   Luckily, our college counselor there knew the name of a guy to see, the guy in the Chicagoland
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.280]   area who you would go to for help with applying for financial aid.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   And we called him up.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280]   He gave us an address.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.240]   He said we were to, you know, show up at 5 p.m. the following Tuesday at this place in
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.760]   Evanston.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.640]   And we were going to, you know, we're supposed to bring him $50 in cash.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.520]   And he said to go through the side door.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   So we thought, OK.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.200]   And we show up at this address.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.120]   And it turns out it's the Office of Financial Aid at Northwestern University.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.360]   And it turns out that we were there to see the assistant director who had this incredible
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.620]   side hustle going on where every day during the fall at 5 p.m. he would usher in these
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.640]   needy families and you would pay him a little money, which he presumably would not report
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.760]   to the IRS or certainly to his employer.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.560]   And then he would proceed to explain to you all of the secrets of the financial aid system.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.260]   And it turned out that this guy knew exactly what he was talking about.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.200]   And I got into Amherst College early decision.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.000]   I got a great financial aid package.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.800]   And I learned a couple of important things from that, namely that, you know, the grown
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.140]   up world was filled just chock full of complex systems involving money.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.000]   And they were totally made to be hacked.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.800]   He wasn't encouraging us to break the law.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.720]   But there was this guy out there who knew the answers.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.960]   And for very little money, you know, we could get a hold of him and he could tell us what
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.600]   to do.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.920]   That lesson stayed with me.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.960]   So it's not any big surprise, really, that I grew up to be the person whose beat is beating
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840]   the system in the newspaper.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.080]   That's always the way that I've thought of my personal finance work at The Wall Street
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.720]   Journal and now at the New York Times, as a part of that.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.960]   But basically anything and everything that hits you in the wallet, you know, particularly
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.640]   items that have large costs or large potential costs and that involve a lot of emotions and
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.000]   feelings are the things that I care the most about.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.960]   So of course, when I became a dad in 2005 for the first time, I now have two kids, a
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.920]   15 year old and a five year old, I became a little bit obsessed with 529 plans.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.080]   Back then I was at The Wall Street Journal and there was still a fair bit to say about,
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.120]   you know, the lousy investment choices and the high fees and, you know, the various limitations
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.160]   and the complexity.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.480]   As most of the people on this call probably know, we have largely, although not completely,
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.440]   solved for the, you know, generalized mediocrity of these 529 plans.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.600]   So, you know, at a certain point I moved on in my writing to write about how to pay for
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.320]   college instead of how to save for college, because we were starting to hear about all
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.800]   these people coming out of undergraduate with just, you know, piles of student loans, particularly,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.240]   you know, 15 years ago when you could still get these so-called private loans, not the
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.640]   federal loans that are capped, but private loans without any adult cosign.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.200]   So I started, you know, getting into that area and I'm still writing, you know, sort
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.080]   of sporadically about those very complex systems involving money that we have not yet solved
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.620]   for in The New York Times.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.240]   But what started to happen as time went on is that I would hear from readers and from,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:09.160]   you know, colleagues and friends who were super confused, not so much about how to save
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.800]   and not so much about how to pay.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.520]   They were asking value questions.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.940]   They would come to me and they'd say, "Ron, you know, my kid, you know, got into the University
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.160]   of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and that's going to be maybe $125,000 because we don't
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.280]   qualify for any need-based aid.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.360]   My kid also got into Kenyon College because they're interested in English being a writer
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.680]   and that's a really great small liberal arts college in Ohio.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.000]   And they gave us a bunch of discounts even though we don't qualify for any need-based
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   financial aid.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.340]   That's going to be $200,000.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.040]   And then my kid shot the lights out and got into Northwestern, right?
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.720]   So that's going to be $300,000.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.680]   Where in your, you know, library of big data sets that you keep track of over there is
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.080]   the data set that tells me why, you know, Northwestern is $200,000 better than University
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   of Illinois.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   And we're going to get into that.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.080]   We're going to get into that.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.760]   And I don't have that, right?
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.720]   So I thought, wow, I need to start thinking about value.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.240]   I need to start thinking about what to pay for college, too.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.120]   And so that was sort of my journey to becoming obsessed with, you know, the college question.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.040]   It was from personal experience as a student, as a middle-income student.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.680]   It was from personal experience as an investor with one and then two kids living in New York
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   City, a high cost area.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.280]   And then it was from professional experience with this like avalanche of incredibly confused
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.400]   people asking questions about value that I did not know how to answer.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:49.380]   Well your book starts with a discussion that contrasts the advertised cost of college by
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.600]   those institutions with the price of college.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.560]   So I'm going to show a chart.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:06.720]   And this chart is the price of the cost of college from 1980 through 2000.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.260]   Now 1980 is a really important period, date for me, because it's when I graduated college.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:19.920]   And I went back and I looked, I actually paid room and board, tuition, everything else $10,000
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.120]   for a four-year degree at the University of Rhode Island.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   That's what it cost.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:31.480]   Now this shows, this chart is showing the cost of college over the next 40 years going
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.280]   up by 1200%.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:43.560]   And during that same period of time, the cost of inflation going up by 236.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   So here's what I did.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:53.440]   I went back to my old alma mater, the University of Rhode Island, and I said, if I paid $10,000
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   back in 1980, and it was the cost of inflation was 236%, I would pay $36,600 for the same
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.080]   education today.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:13.400]   Turns out, yeah, turns out though, I actually looked at the data that I got off the administration
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:21.960]   of the website from the University of Rhode Island, and it came out exactly to $128,000.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.640]   This chart is very accurate.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.200]   Now my question to you, Ron, is why does this chart exist?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.800]   What happened here?
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   So I guess let's start by making sure we label this chart correctly, right?
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.020]   Because what we were looking at there was list prices.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.080]   And I assume at some point sooner rather than later in the hour, we'll get to net prices
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.980]   and discounts, right?
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.620]   But there are plenty of people who pay the list prices, particularly at public institutions
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.940]   like URI that don't have a lot of institutional aid.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:07.740]   And if you're a good bogal head and you saved effectively, you may have so many assets and
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.740]   perhaps enough income to support those assets, you don't qualify for much need-based aid.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.660]   And so you may well pay the list price.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.780]   So let's talk about those list prices.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.940]   First of all, let's consider a public institution like the one that you attended or any flagship
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.980]   state university.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:33.060]   What's gone on there more than anything that's caused that line to be so steep is a decrease
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:38.780]   in the amount of subsidy that the state legislatures give to the schools, right?
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.660]   I mean, to the extent that the price of those institutions are, quote unquote, artificially
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.140]   low, that they don't cover the costs of actually maintaining the buildings and paying all the
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:54.280]   professors and providing programming for the students is because the state uses tax or
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.080]   other revenue and just hands it over to the university to keep tuition costs down, right?
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.580]   So back in the day, this was thought to be a useful enterprise, a good investment.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.580]   A well-trained workforce grows up to be more productive, pays higher taxes because it's
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.460]   earning more, and that money just sort of comes back to the state and it gets a return
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.420]   on investment.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:24.180]   But back in the last big recession in particular, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, these states were
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:33.500]   so hammered by a loss of tax revenue in that enormous recession back then that they had
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.140]   to make some difficult choices.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:41.980]   And one really easy thing to do politically, right, is just to sort of stick it to the
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:47.780]   state university system, right, and force the chancellor and the board to make difficult
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.240]   decisions about whether they're going to raise prices or whether they're going to cut services
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.180]   or cut programs, right?
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.160]   And those schools felt like, well, we can raise prices because what it really means
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.100]   is that these students and these families will probably just have to borrow a little
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.720]   bit more, maybe $1,000 extra per year.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.640]   They can afford it, right, because this was already a subsidized education in particular.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.120]   But if that thinking continues to feed on itself over time, that's how you get a chart
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.820]   like this with public institutions.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.700]   Now if you're looking at the chart for private institutions, it's a little bit more like
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:28.100]   this for a variety of reasons in the market that we can talk about.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:34.100]   Still pretty steep, far outpacing inflation, but starting from a higher price, which is
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.260]   why the angle, the slope is not as high as it would be for publics.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:46.060]   With the privates, we have a different problem going on there, shared somewhat with the publics.
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:52.940]   But the private institutions need to justify their higher prices with more faculty, better
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.820]   services, shinier buildings.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.140]   They're in competition with the state university systems, right?
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:06.400]   But the other thing they have going on is that as time has gone on, both market demand
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.060]   and regulatory requirements have meant that these institutions have either needed to or
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:17.260]   felt like they really had no choice, but to add a whole bunch of administrators, right?
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:23.700]   We've got all sorts of new laws that require equality on the playing field for our daughters,
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.700]   right?
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.940]   Title IX.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:34.400]   All sorts of regulations that speak to diversity and equal access in areas outside of gender.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.140]   We have ever higher technology budgets at these institutions.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.420]   There are parents who demand bigger and better career centers, right?
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.620]   Kids have become accustomed to living in a certain manner.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.660]   And if your dorms don't have air conditioning, well, people may not choose your school, right?
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:58.220]   And so there are all these market pressures, regulatory pressures, which has led to there
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.060]   being a much higher number of administrators at these schools.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.380]   Administrators don't come cheap.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.380]   They're reasonably well-trained.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.380]   They're experienced.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:14.180]   And I think if you get right down to it, right, as a parent, if you've got a child who's going
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:20.020]   to college and they've got a medium-grade mental health challenge, right, you don't
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:25.180]   want a 23-year-old grad student working in the counseling center using your child as
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.020]   their guinea pig, right?
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:33.100]   You want a 43-year-old PhD psychologist working in the mental health center to take care of
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.060]   your precious child who you've pushed off into the world for the first time, right?
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.940]   And you multiply that times all sorts of different parents with all sorts of different needs.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.340]   And pretty soon you have a lot more administrators than you used to.
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.300]   And that's got to be paid for some way.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.620]   And for the private institutions, if they don't have a big endowment, that comes from
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.860]   tuition.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.500]   So that's how the list price goes up there.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.620]   I'll have another screen.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.900]   And this one shows the difference for 2000-2021.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:07.500]   Up on top is a two-year public college, basically a community college.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:13.300]   And then you have your four-year college, public, 26,800, and then you have your four-year
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.060]   out-of-state, 43,000.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.060]   This is all inclusive.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.940]   It's tuition, room and board, books and supplies, transportation, and so forth.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.740]   And then the bottom is your nonprofit.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.940]   It's going to be private, nonprofit, four-year college.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.100]   Now, a couple of things that strike me is, number one, why does it cost more money to
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:36.420]   live in a dorm in a private college than a public college?
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.420]   I don't know.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:43.820]   The second thing is, you know, the books, I noticed the books have increased with the
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.540]   rate of that original inflation, the cost.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.860]   Books have gone up about 1,200% over the last 40 years, too.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.180]   So they have far outpaced the cost of just buying a regular book.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.980]   In fact, if you bought a regular book, the cost has actually come down.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.420]   It's basically been lower than the inflation rate.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:06.140]   So tell me, if you will, if you know this, what's going on with textbooks, college textbooks?
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.420]   Why are they so expensive?
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:17.740]   So I know a little bit about this only because I helped some friends of mine run a campus-based
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.580]   used bookstore back in the late '80s and early '90s.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:28.780]   And look, you know, some industries have higher profit margins than others.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.660]   And textbook publishers really rake it in.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.020]   Why do they do that?
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.620]   Well, first of all, I can tell you the how, right?
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:45.460]   If you put out a slightly changed, really just like repaginated, where you change the
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.860]   font size of the edition of your textbook every 18 months, then you can just sink the
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.580]   used textbook market altogether.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.900]   And if you want to do well in the class and don't want to be checking the book out from
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.500]   the library, you've got no choice but to buy this thing.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.660]   And the books back in the day would only be available at the campus bookstore.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.140]   And you paid the list price, and that was that.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:13.580]   And there's a reasonably high barrier to entry for these things because the professors themselves
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.220]   have high standards.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.380]   They want the textbook to be excellent.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:24.980]   And it turns out it takes a couple of years to write a really great, thoughtful textbook
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:30.060]   for organic chemistry or for psych 101 or for econ.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.500]   And so they do this because they can.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:39.860]   I mean, it's not an incredibly large piece of the budgetary pie, but it's just high enough
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.140]   that it really bugs people.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:49.260]   And there have been various attempts at innovation, most recently with the electronic textbook
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.500]   publishing.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.740]   And that's helped some, but this is just a slow industry to change.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:04.260]   And people, the professors in particular, have sort of ingrained habits, and it's a
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.580]   tough one to crack.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:12.180]   So let me ask a question since college is getting to be so expensive, as we've seen.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.460]   And we'll get into what people actually pay as opposed to what the advertised cost is
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.700]   here in a little bit.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:24.540]   But tell me whether it's still worth it to pay all of this money to go to a four-year
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.540]   college.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.580]   Are you going to get a better job?
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.700]   And what's the data show?
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:34.020]   Should you go to college anymore or a four-year college?
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.740]   Well, so let's start with the baseline economic data.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:47.880]   The baseline economic data tells us that there's roughly a million-dollar lifetime gap in earnings
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:55.100]   between people who go to college and finish, which is important because roughly there's
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.540]   a very high percentage of people who go to college or start college and never actually
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.540]   finish.
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.700]   So that million-dollar difference is between people who finish and people who don't or
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.740]   who never go in the first place.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.060]   So that's a lot of money over time, but that's just an average.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.220]   So of course, all of our kids are above average.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:20.140]   And the ones who are above average, who don't go to college, are ones who enter highly paid
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:26.780]   trades for which there is a relatively consistent demand, often in a situation where they're
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:32.000]   self-employed and not at the whim of whether the local manufacturer moves out of town or
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.740]   whether the Chrysler plant closes and moves to Mexico.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.780]   And so much is going to depend on the choices you make.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:49.340]   I ask people to consider a different question because not everybody goes to college for
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.900]   the same reason in the first place.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:57.340]   So trying to figure out what's worth it and how much it's worth gets to the very definition
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.420]   of what college is in the first place.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.920]   And when I started doing the reporting for the price you pay for college, people sort
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.300]   of looked at me funny when I asked them, "Well, what is college?"
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:14.060]   They would just sort of look back at me blankly, and I'm like, "Surely you've thought about
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.940]   the point of the exercise if you're about to maybe spend $300,000 on this thing, right?"
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.460]   And then their faces scrunch up and they're like, "Yeah, I guess we should do that," right?
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.620]   And so I get them talking, right?
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.760]   And it really just comes down to three things.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.900]   College first and foremost, not foremost, foremost for some people, first, college first
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.460]   is about the education, right?
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.620]   It's about the learning.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:43.800]   It's about having your mind grown and your mind blown, right?
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.700]   Essentially having your brain taken apart and put back together again by an expert practitioner.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.380]   So that's the first part.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.940]   The second part of college for many people is the kinship, right?
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:01.300]   You go to college to find the people that you never could have imagined existing in
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.660]   the world, right?
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:10.960]   The people who will be by your side for the rest of your life and who will mold and shape
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:17.200]   you themselves through four years of banter and decades afterwards of friendship.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.580]   These are also the people who will form the beginnings of your career network.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.820]   And it's not just peers, by the way, it's also grownups, right?
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:32.260]   It is the professors, it is the deans or other people you encounter along the way who will
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:38.100]   become your mentor and who will sort of drag you into a bigger and better version of yourself.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.660]   So that's number two, college is about the people.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.060]   And then number three, college is also, of course, at least for most people, about the
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.940]   credential, right?
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:52.840]   And maybe that's a credential that allows you to take a kind of quantum leap up the
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:59.780]   social class ladder and into a middle-class career where there is a reasonable amount
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:05.860]   of job security because you've gotten a bachelor's in nursing or a bachelor's in accounting or
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.460]   something like that, or you're going to go to med school.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:17.300]   Or perhaps you're getting that credential because you know that the degree from Princeton
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:24.300]   when you're coming from rural Wisconsin will open doors for you into industries and companies
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:31.580]   that never would have been open to you otherwise, with the sort of social capital and the snobbery
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:37.700]   and elitism and all of it that comes with a fancy name-plated degree.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.300]   So those are the three things that college are about.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.900]   And there's no right answer to the question.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.600]   Some people think all three are of equal importance.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.660]   Then there's some people who are only going for the kinship.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.020]   And I make no judgments about that.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.860]   I only make judgments about the people who never stop to ask themselves the question
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.940]   in the first place, because if you don't do that, how do you know what you're shopping
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.660]   for?
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.940]   So we're going to go to college.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.060]   The children or the grandchildren are going to go to college.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:16.100]   Now we have to figure out, well, which college, and then how to get into that college, and
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.580]   then how to pay for that college.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.620]   So let's start out with selecting the right school.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.740]   You list three unhelpful feelings.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:31.980]   You call them the three unhelpful feelings of fear, guilt, and snobbery and elitism.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.300]   Can you explain why these are unhealthy?
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.540]   Sure.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:44.980]   Well, I guess where you start is you always want to be checking yourself.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:51.780]   And this is not going to be any news to Bogleheads.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:24:01.540]   The Boglehead community has become used to, over decades, resisting flashiness, resisting
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:09.300]   so-called expertise, resisting the smart man and the smart woman who are supposedly the
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:15.520]   end-all, be-all of investing prowess.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:23.740]   And so what are the things that can cause you to spend more than you need to?
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:29.740]   And I think those emotions and those answers apply equally well to colleges as they do
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.620]   to mutual funds or ETFs, right?
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.940]   First of all is fear, right?
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:42.020]   Fear that if you don't spend money, fear that if you don't believe that you'll get what
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.540]   you pay for and the more you pay, the more you'll get, the fear that if you do it wrong,
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:54.060]   if you cheap out, right, that in this instance, your kids will go tumbling down the social
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:25:02.420]   class ladder from wherever it is that you've managed to clamber up to because you were
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.500]   too cheap, essentially, right?
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.260]   And that there's something wrong with you as a parent or as a grandparent if you're
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:15.340]   not ponying up for the most expensive version of whatever it is that you know that your
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.000]   kid actually needs, right?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.180]   College is not a want for many families, it's a given, right?
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:27.340]   So this is actually a need, it's just a question of how much you're going to pay for it.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.380]   So there's that fear, right?
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.380]   Then there's guilt.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:39.740]   Guilt that we have not saved enough to provide whatever it is our kid wants in this category
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.700]   of need.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.180]   Guilt that we do not earn enough.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:48.180]   Guilt that we chose the wrong profession that does not allow us to write a $300,000 check
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.980]   after taxes out of current income.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:56.940]   Guilt that we cannot do what our parents did for us even though Rick's parents in 1980,
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:04.140]   if they did pay for any of it, and it looks like they didn't, but had they wanted to or
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:12.460]   been able to, the final price tag for you, as you just explained at the top of the hour,
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:20.420]   doesn't look anything like the $128,000 price tag, you know, the 17 Kingston or Cranston
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.220]   or Providence would be looking at right now, right?
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.060]   And so, you know, we get ourselves all hung up on what our parents did for us without
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.500]   really understanding that the world has changed entirely.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:37.180]   Or maybe we get all hung up on what our parents did not do for us, right?
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.940]   And we either deeply resent that they had the ability but not the willingness to pay
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:48.700]   for us, or we know how much we struggled because they did not have enough money through no
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.700]   faults of their own, and we want it to be exactly the opposite for our kids.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.900]   We want them never to have to worry about money during college for a second, no matter
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.700]   how much it costs, right?
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.220]   And if we haven't accomplished that, if we haven't satisfied that goal, then we're doing
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.220]   it wrong, right?
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.660]   So it's just like guilt, guilt, guilt.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:09.860]   We can send ourselves on so many guilt trips about this stuff, and I'm trying to get people
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.420]   off those guilt trips.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:17.540]   And then the fear and the snobbery is, you know, about the subconscious or maybe the
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:24.060]   conscious sense that where our kid goes to school, where we can afford to send our kid,
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:33.380]   where they are able to get in, is all some kind of, you know, final exam on parenting.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:40.260]   That the results of which is displayed in public, to the public, through like, you know,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:45.580]   the Facebook and Instagram sweatshirt reveals and the bumper sticker in the window, right?
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.980]   And you want that college to be as prestigious or fancy as possible, otherwise you did it
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.980]   wrong.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.300]   Otherwise, you know, you've gotten a C- as a parent, right?
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:00.340]   Or even if we manage to kind of get over that and step outside of ourselves, we're worried
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.420]   about other people's snobbery, right?
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:11.660]   Because if we got a 16-year-old budding investment banker on our hands, and that kid has already
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:16.300]   figured out that like, oh, okay, if I'm going to do this, I want to be an investment banking
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:22.100]   analyst, you know, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, or, you know, a couple of other Wall
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.000]   Street firms.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.060]   Those places are just chock full of snobs and elitists, and they are not going to hire
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.780]   you out of Wisconsin Whitewater, right?
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:37.900]   But they are going to hire you out of Princeton, they are going to take a close look there.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:45.420]   And so, you know, if you've got a, if you've got 10,000 acres, and, you know, 5,000 head
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:50.940]   of dairy cattle, you know, up in northern Wisconsin, and you're tempted to, you know,
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.460]   just send your kid to Wisconsin Whitewater, that's great, but if that kid really wants
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.980]   to be a banker, and you want that kid to have a shot at their dream, and you're not going
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.540]   to earn any need-based financial aid, because you're making all that money, you know, selling
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.660]   the milk to Ben and Jerry's, you're going to think really hard about spending that $300,000
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.580]   for Princeton if your kid manages to get it.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.620]   Not because you think it's worth it, but because somebody else on Wall Street is a big freaking
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.360]   snob, right?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.180]   And so, you know, these are relatively limited circumstances, but, you know, as a parent,
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:30.180]   right, I can see how if you have the means or the ability to borrow, right, you want
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:37.140]   to do everything you possibly can, or you're tempted to, not to close off any avenues to
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.020]   your kid whatsoever.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.860]   And that is how people end up spending $300,000 or borrowing to do so.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.180]   And sometimes it's for, you know, a reasonably good reason, and sometimes it's because people
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.780]   are confused.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:57.660]   So you talk a lot in the book about value, you know, are you getting the value out of
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.700]   your education, or so forth.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.620]   So how do you separate, for each individual, of course, it's different.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:10.580]   So how do you separate value, and how do you find value in the college system?
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.580]   Sure.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.140]   So, I mean, it begins with trying to figure out what it is that you're going to school
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.620]   for, right?
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.620]   So let's forget about the 16-year-old investment banker for a minute.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:29.340]   Let's think about the 16-year-old who wants nothing more than to be a marine biologist,
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   right?
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.420]   And this isn't, you know, the eight-year-old who, like, loves the dolphins.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.740]   This is the 16-year-old who's, like, shooting the lights out in AP Bio, and has done an
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:43.500]   internship and, like, you know, is reasonably sure that they want to go not just to college,
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.780]   but to graduate school, right?
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.740]   So you're thinking about a lot of things there, right?
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:55.540]   But probably the first thing you're thinking about, hopefully, is, you know, you're thinking
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.980]   about the quality of the education, but what you're also thinking about is the quality
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.740]   of the mentorship, right?
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:10.380]   Because you know that you can't get into one of these, you know, teeny-tiny, very competitive
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.140]   marine biology PhD programs, or you figure this out with a little bit of research.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:20.940]   You can't do that without just a glowing, lights-out recommendation from your undergraduate,
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.040]   you know, faculty advisor, right?
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.780]   So how are you going to find somebody in an institution who's going to actually get to
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.080]   know your kid well enough to be able to write that kind of recommendation?
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.580]   And what sort of environment or circumstances are going to need to exist?
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:42.300]   Is there a better chance of that happening if they're in, you know, Biology 101 with
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.700]   800 other people, including 300 people who want to go to medical school?
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.540]   Was there a better chance of that happening if they go to a small liberal arts college
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.780]   that happens to have a really great biology program, right?
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.820]   So you know, you start thinking about size.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.340]   You start thinking about faculty content, right?
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:06.380]   Again, right, if you're, you know, up there in northern Wisconsin and you've got that
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:11.740]   studying marine biologist on your hands who wants to do it someplace other than, you know,
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.860]   Lake Superior, you know, maybe you're going to send them to, you know, to Madison or to
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.380]   Wisconsin Whitewater.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.980]   But there may be a lot of adjunct professors there or part-timers who aren't even going
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.260]   to be around two or three years later.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.940]   Whereas if they go to Lawrence University, you know, small, small, smaller school, you
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.740]   know, if they go to Knox College, if they go to one of the, you know, smaller colleges
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.620]   in Minnesota, they're going to have a better shot at making that kind of contact, right?
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:44.620]   And then you can go looking for data, which actually does exist, that will tell you, you
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:52.460]   know, where, which undergraduate institutions, the PhD students, you know, at the, at the
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.940]   biggest biology programs for PhD students, you know, where, where the undergraduates
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.660]   actually come from, right?
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.660]   This data is out there.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:04.220]   So, you know, you start looking for whatever data or evidence you can exist, you can, that
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:11.700]   exists that might give you some sense of whether an institution that costs more than your state
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:18.420]   university might actually be worth it if it stands the chance of raising the odds of helping
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.060]   your kid do whatever it is that they want to do.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.920]   So there are a number of problems with this, right?
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:29.580]   First of all, to the extent that the colleges have good data on outcomes, they're not
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.620]   always so great about sharing, right?
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:36.740]   Because if everybody shared standardized data, then there would be even more ways to compare
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.300]   and rank the schools.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.880]   And this is not in their interest.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.820]   And so, you know, there's not always great data.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.140]   It isn't easy to find, I spent years, you know, sort of hoovering up resources and trying
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.540]   to spit them out in the book, but I was not ultimately satisfied with what I was able
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.820]   to put together and, and it's the school's fault, right?
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.820]   And then there's the not so small matter of the fact that we are dealing with children,
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.100]   right?
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.660]   For reasons lost to history, but that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.400]   We spend all this money on teenagers, right?
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.100]   We don't send them off to serve in the U.S. armed forces on a mandatory basis.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.860]   We don't send them off to do non-military national service.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.300]   We don't encourage them for the most part to take a year or two off before going to
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   college.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.340]   And these 18 year olds who've never done a darn thing in the world, except, you know,
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:31.580]   scoop ice cream and work at a day camp and, and, you know, sit in, sit in high school,
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.580]   going to college and we're making these six figure decisions, investments based on what
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.780]   we think their interests are.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.380]   But some of them have no earthy idea what they want to do.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:45.620]   And then many of the rest who are absolutely certain about Wall Street or marine biology
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.900]   change their minds once they get into a really good college classroom and get exposed to,
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.200]   you know, bigger and better ideas.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.400]   So the whole thing is fundamentally flawed and deeply dissatisfied.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:06.180]   And and I'm just trying to help people, you know, walk through a reasonably dysfunctional
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:11.380]   system with their heads screwed on reasonably straight.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.580]   That's great.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.580]   Okay.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:21.300]   So at the end of this journey, you're going to pick out a few schools and you're going
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.500]   to have to apply to get into those schools.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.420]   So I have a slide on that.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.300]   And here's my slide for that.
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.140]   Is it flickering or is it okay?
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.620]   Can you see that?
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:44.300]   Well, I learned this by watching television.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:49.180]   But anyway, so now we need to get it.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.180]   We need to get it.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:55.880]   And with that in mind, the big thing these days seems to be diversity.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:03.260]   I was listening to some entrance experts, if you will, former admissions experts, and
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:08.700]   they were talking about diversity, diversity, diversity, not just race and religion, but
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.820]   athletics, anything that sets you apart from others.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.900]   So how do you use diversity to get into the school you want to get into?
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.900]   Sure.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:27.780]   So, I mean, let's just talk briefly and bluntly about how this works at the 20 most rejected
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:33.420]   schools in the country, the schools that reject the highest percentage of applicants.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:41.020]   And there you are at the biggest advantage if you are rich and if you are white.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:48.900]   You're at an advantage if you're rich, because you can donate a building, right?
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:55.140]   And it tends to be way more affluent and way whiter people who benefit from what's known
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:59.580]   as what's known as a legacy preference, right?
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.740]   Where your grades can be lower and your scores can be lower as long as your mom or your dad
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.660]   or both or like four generations of Cabot's, you know, or eight generations, you know,
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.720]   went to Harvard or Amherst or Stanford.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.860]   Those people tend to be disproportionately affluent and white.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:20.980]   When it comes to athletic preference, which gives you even a bigger edge than the legacy
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:26.220]   preference does, you know, many of those sports, although not all, but, you know, the majority
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:31.740]   of them are sports that require a great deal of investment and nurturing to, you know,
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:40.560]   get you to a place through the private tutoring, through the, you know, through the, you know,
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.740]   the, you know, kind of elite level club sports, right, that will get you ready to swim or
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.800]   play golf or play tennis or play lacrosse or play hockey at an institution that will
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.340]   give you a preference, right?
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:58.940]   So there, too, being wealthy gives you the bigger advantage and more often than not,
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.820]   the people who are wealthy are white.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:06.560]   Same thing through with, you know, testing and tutoring on academics.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:12.500]   And then there are preferences based on race, which are the ones that get the most attention,
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   but may have a little bit less to do with who gets in than, you know, the total number
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.620]   of people who get in via legacy preference or via athletic preference, particularly in
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.540]   the rich white sports.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:34.580]   So all of that is like a, you know, big kind of toxic stew that generates a lot of attention.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:40.740]   But what I think people miss a lot of the time is that like a step below there at some
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.940]   still like really excellent high quality schools that, you know, reject way more applicants
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:51.880]   than they can take, there is actually, you know, a huge advantage to being able to pay
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.940]   full price because they get 50 or 75 percent of the way through the number of admissions
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:02.080]   they have to hand out, and then they start running out of financial aid money, right?
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:07.300]   And then the packages get weaker or they just start rejecting people who need aid, right?
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:14.100]   So if you are a Bogle head and you, you know, have those compound interest charts imprinted
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:20.080]   in your brain, which I do thanks to my dad and the USA Magazine, you know, sending me
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:26.240]   one when I was 23 years old, I knew good and well, right, that I, you know, I didn't want
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:32.160]   money to be a factor, and so I just started saving for college for my kids, like, well,
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.560]   they were still in utero, right?
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:42.020]   So money does provide a really sizable and sometimes measurable admissions advantage
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.020]   there too.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.520]   So, you know, in many of these institutions that parents would be proud to send their
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.920]   kids to, it's good to be rich.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.680]   So you know, it's complicated and it becomes politicized, but the fact of the matter is
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:04.380]   that there are all sorts of people of all sorts of skin tones and backgrounds benefiting
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:10.600]   from a certain amount of admissions preference.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.480]   And that makes it harder, you know, in many instances, in most instances, for people who
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.640]   do not have any sort of a hook.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:29.200]   But we shouldn't forget that there are hundreds and hundreds of, you know, essentially open
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.640]   access undergraduate institutions out there, where more or less anybody can go, you know,
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.920]   if you can fog a mirror, and you know, there's a lot of dedicated instructors at those places
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:46.400]   too, and you know, I don't want to discount the worth of those institutions.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:53.560]   So I was reading in the book that we were talking about the advertised price of college
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:41:01.920]   and the two reasons why colleges put these very high prices on their website.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.460]   Number one, because some people will pay it, they'll pay it.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:10.280]   And number two is because if they don't put the high price on there, people don't think
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.840]   they're getting good value for their money.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:20.640]   So with that in mind, let's getting into how do we pay for college?
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.240]   First of all, let's talk about discounting.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:29.080]   And I really, it was enlightening to me and reading your book that internally, admissions
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.960]   people call it discounting, but externally, they call it scholarships.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.200]   Anyway, could you go into discounting?
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.880]   What should you pay?
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   Not what the price is, but what should you pay?
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   Right.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.200]   Well, gosh, where do we start here?
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:52.360]   I mean, there's a couple of different ways that these discounts happen, and you know,
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.400]   we'll use the terms interchangeably, but what you want to be thinking about as a parent,
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.000]   as a shopper, right?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.500]   Like what is the, you know, what is my actual cost of attendance going to be?
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:08.680]   And if I get, you know, an offer of, you know, financial aid, am I a hundred percent sure
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:15.280]   I understand which of these discounts or scholarships, you know, that we're not going to have to
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.360]   pay back and that, you know, we understand how much the school is asking us to actually
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.240]   pay out of pocket and, or what it's telling us to borrow, right?
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.320]   So there's two basic kinds of financial aid, you know, back in our day, even back in my
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.200]   day, I'm a couple of years younger than you, Rick.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.400]   Most of the financial aid that was offered was offered based on need, right?
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.760]   So my family had to kind of lay ourselves bare in terms of our income and our assets.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.320]   And then Amherst College decided what they thought we could afford to pay.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.440]   And they basically were good for the rest of it with, you know, with a couple of, you
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.240]   know, campus jobs and undergraduate loans thrown in.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:01.800]   What's changed now is that that need-based aid system still exists and, you know, at
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:09.660]   the hundred or so, you know, most well-resourced private institutions in America, state systems
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.520]   are a little different, but, you know, at the private ones, it still kind of looks like
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   that.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.280]   But, you know, starting around in the nineties, this like whole separate system hived off
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.460]   that's become known as merit aid.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:31.080]   And merit aid was originally designed to help, like, you know, fourth tier institutions improve
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:36.920]   to the third or second tier by swiping kids who were qualified for second or even first
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.280]   tier institutions by throwing money at them and making them feel good, right?
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   So if you got this unsolicited offer in the mail after you took your PSAT test and you'd
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   done well, from a school that you've never heard of, you know, the letter would say,
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:56.500]   "Hey, we have our eye on you and we're not going to charge you any application fee.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:01.640]   If you come here and you get in, you know, we'll give you $5,000 off the list price."
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.840]   And that worked so well, so many of the, you know, of the good smart kids, like were getting
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:13.760]   bought off, you know, from higher tier institutions that market forces intervened, you know, competition
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.760]   took hold and over the course of 10 or 15 or 20 years, it just kind of moved, you know,
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:25.920]   farther and farther up the food chain where now, you know, it's really only 30 or 40 schools
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.640]   that aren't forced to offer some kind of discount.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:35.480]   And let's be clear too, this merit aid discounting, it has nothing to do with your ability to
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.180]   pay and kind of everything to do with your willingness, right?
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:44.120]   So there are all sorts of super rich families who are being offered 10, 20, $30,000 off
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:50.720]   a year or even a full ride if the school has decided that their kids are attractive, whether
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:56.000]   because of their actual academic or extracurricular merit, or just because they're throwing money
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.640]   around to, you know, try and get people to come.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.280]   So, you know, think about it this way, right?
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:10.260]   If you're Kenyon College, right, in Ohio or Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut,
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:17.500]   if you are Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, you know, excellent schools, but
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:23.660]   they have slipped enough in terms of marketplace perception that even a certain number of people
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:30.260]   with the ability to pay $75,000 a year are lacking the willingness to do so, right?
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:35.840]   But if you are Macalester and your cost to educate a student is $42,000 a year, right?
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.480]   You're charging a list price of 70, right?
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:44.320]   If you throw an $18,000 merit aid package at an affluent family, that family's going
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.640]   to feel really good about what it has accomplished, right?
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:54.980]   Because they're going to get 18, 36, 54, $72,000 off over the course of four years.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.320]   Their cost of attendance in any given year is $52,000, right?
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:05.920]   But if Macalester only needs $40,000 to educate that kid, that's still a $12,000 profit, right?
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.440]   And they can take that profit and they can toss it at a lower income family and help
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.120]   them too, right?
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:18.520]   So in theory, everybody wins, but it's a real weird look to be throwing scholarships at
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.760]   millionaires, which is essentially what's going on.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:31.600]   And so as a parent, as a shopper, it is not at all clear that this is going on, the extent
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:40.360]   to which it's going on, nor is it predictable in many instances how much you will get, right?
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:48.120]   And so for somebody with like a bogal head mindset, the temptation and the desire, once
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.240]   you understand what's going on behind the curtain, is to crack the code, right?
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.800]   To try and beat the system.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:01.200]   And so I did my level best in the book to show people exactly where the data is that
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.600]   can give them some level of predictability about what kind of merit it might be offered.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.840]   But the fact of the matter is, is that the schools kind of change their goals each year,
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:17.240]   in part depending on their own institutional priorities, and also based on what's going
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.280]   on in the market around them.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.160]   And especially in the last couple of years with the pandemic, whatever algorithms they're
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:30.280]   using to try and decide what prices to offer which students, which is another revelation
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   for people.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:38.000]   A lot of these merit aid offers are delivered by robots, by software, not by humans, right?
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.420]   These algorithms can't predict how people are going to behave during a pandemic.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:47.600]   And so you're getting all sorts of wacky results where people are getting no discounts or they're
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.760]   deciding to apply to 22 schools just because it's all so unpredictable, and they're only
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.120]   getting into four, and it's all a real hash.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:02.480]   I do hope that things will have kind of leveled out and they'll be making more sense by next
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.240]   year.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.040]   But it's not always predictable.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:15.200]   So the best we can do sometimes is just attempt to explain how the system works, even if we
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:23.240]   can't predict precisely what kind of offer it's going to make in any given year.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.960]   Let's get on to a couple of other ways of saving.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.620]   And that is the most popular one is a 529 plan.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.580]   And a lot of people use 529 plans, parents use them, grandparents use them.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.560]   Some states give tax breaks, some don't.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:41.240]   A lot of people ask, the most common question I get about 529s is how much is enough?
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.520]   How much should I put in?
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:49.560]   Or should I put in every year and what do I need to get to by age 18 when my son or
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.720]   daughter goes to college?
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.960]   So could you talk about 529?
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.360]   And then the next question I'm going to ask would be the final question, because we don't
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.040]   have any more time, will be student loans.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.360]   So 529s first, and then student loans second.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.360]   Sure.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.320]   So let's start with 529s.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.160]   As I think most of the people in this crowd probably know, the nice thing about 529s is
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.680]   that they come with some sizable tax benefits, right?
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.840]   In 30-some states, you get some kind of a tax break for putting money in in the first
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.840]   place.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.760]   And then for everybody, you get a huge tax break on the way out.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:33.360]   As long as you take the money and you use it for some higher educational purpose, or
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:40.720]   for private K-12 schools in many states, you don't pay any capital gains taxes on the earnings.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.360]   And so if you start at age zero and you get the kind of market that we've had the last
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.320]   15 or 20 years, you're going to have a lot of capital gains that you're not paying taxes
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   on.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.700]   So yay for beating the system, right?
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:57.240]   So the downside is there's a bit of complexity.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.320]   Every state has their own plan.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.840]   The rules tend to be different.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:08.760]   Different investment lineups, sometimes, although with increasingly less frequency, your plan
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:14.840]   may not have an index fund for every asset class that you want to be in, although that's
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.120]   mostly gone now.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.400]   It was definitely the case 10 or 15 years ago.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:26.480]   Thankfully, Vanguard and others who index are running or providing investments for most
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   of these plans.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.720]   So how much should you save?
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:34.080]   Well, save as much as you reasonably can, right?
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.080]   Everybody's different.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.640]   Here's something to anchor to that might make you not freak out, because I talk to a lot
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:46.080]   of parents of young kids and if they can do any kind of inflation math in their head,
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.880]   they're thinking, wow, if I want my kid to go to the institutions that we went to, it's
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:56.920]   going to be $500,000 by the time they're 18.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.640]   And that's insane, right?
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.580]   I'm still paying off my student loan debt.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.240]   We haven't bought our forever home yet.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.640]   We want to have seven figures in retirement savings.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.920]   How am I going to do this, right?
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:13.840]   So many years ago, I had a conversation with a financial planner in Wisconsin named Kevin
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:19.200]   McKinley, who came up with what I now refer to as the McKinley rule, which is just to
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.400]   think about it in fractions.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.880]   You could think about it this way, right?
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.560]   You want to save a third of the money that they'll need for college.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:31.880]   And maybe your goal is public, or maybe your goal is private, or maybe it's somewhere in
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.720]   between those two list prices as we've discussed, right?
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.640]   So you want to save a third, you want to pay for a third out of current income, right?
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:48.280]   So while they're in college, you stop taking vacations, you eat rice and beans, you do
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:52.480]   whatever you can, and you pay for a third of that while they're there, and then you
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.760]   borrow a third.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.640]   Maybe the parents borrow half of that third and the kid borrows the other half, right?
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:04.960]   Although if your kid goes to a state university, the federal loan borrowing limit of $31,000
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.280]   or so will almost cover that third all alone, right?
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.920]   So then this starts to feel reasonable, right?
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:16.640]   If your goal is to end up with $50,000 of savings in today's dollars, you can do that
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.400]   with 250 bucks a month or whatever it is, depending on your return assumptions.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.560]   And that starts to feel a little more doable for families, right?
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.080]   Then you're not driving yourself crazy.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:32.880]   Now that number is going to need to be higher if you want to have a third of a private college
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.800]   available to you 18 years from now.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.040]   And if you have more than one kid, well, right, there you go, right?
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.040]   So what can you do?
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.640]   Well, you can talk to grandparents about this, right?
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.400]   Even $50 a month of a contribution from a relative can make an appreciable difference
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.400]   going forward.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.200]   Okay to ask, right?
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.320]   Much better than all the plastic trinkets that they tend to show up with that end up
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.160]   underfoot and then in the garbage.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.760]   And so those are the basics, right?
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.800]   There's an hour-long debate we could have about whether you might be better off just
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.920]   saving in a standard brokerage account for a whole variety of reasons.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.720]   And that's fine if that's the way you want to go.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:17.880]   I just urge, beg people to start early, save as much as you reasonably can.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:21.740]   It is so rare that anybody regrets saving too much for college.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.940]   That would be a high-class problem.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.240]   So let's talk about student loans for a couple of minutes.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:30.400]   I mean, there are three types, the direct loans from the government, as you mentioned,
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:35.080]   then there's private loans, and then there's parent loans called direct PLU loans.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.960]   Could you just briefly describe the three different types?
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.680]   Sure.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:45.600]   So it has worked different ways over the years, but the way it works today is that if you
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:51.840]   are borrowing from the federal government, there is no bank involved, right?
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:57.900]   And in most instances, if your kid is a dependent, they can borrow roughly $31,000 and change
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.620]   over the course of four years.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.960]   And then what's known as a servicer will step in to start sort of collecting those payments.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.680]   So those are how the undergraduate loans work.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:14.720]   Then there are private loans from institutions like Sallie Mae, Discover, maybe your credit
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:20.280]   union does some of this, a few other companies you may have heard of.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:24.460]   And again, back in the day, undergraduates used to be able to get private loans on top
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:29.920]   of the federal loans or in lieu of the federal loans without any kind of parental grown-up
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.720]   cosigner, and that is not the case anymore.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:38.120]   So if your kid has maxed out their federal loans and you want to borrow even more, which
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.360]   I would encourage you to think hard about whether that's smart or not, you will need
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.680]   to be a cosigner.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:49.000]   And then there's going to be a sort of complex dance afterwards where all of you will have
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.560]   to decide like who's making the payments and whose credit rating is getting messed up if
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:59.240]   the 22-year-old is making the payments and forgets, right, and how much debt is too much
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.520]   and for what sort of degree.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.320]   Then there are those parent loans that you mentioned.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:09.680]   There are what's known as the plus loans that you can get from the federal government, pretty
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:15.840]   high origination rate, pretty high interest rate.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:22.160]   People who do feel the need to borrow sometimes will borrow against their home instead to
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:27.640]   avoid these federal loans.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:33.360]   But parents are increasingly using them, and we actually know more about where this plus
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:39.920]   loan borrowing tends to be most persistent, and it is not as you would expect.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.800]   At private institutions that are not all that well resourced in terms of their financial
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   aid offerings, and also historically black schools have a fair amount of parent borrowing
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.300]   there as well.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.080]   So those are the basic types.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:00.480]   Well, last minute here, you offer a message of hope for people.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.560]   Can you just give us your message of hope?
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   Sure.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.320]   So, I mean, let me tell you about the opposite of hope.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:12.280]   I mean, the opposite of hope, all of these calls that I used to get in March and April
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:19.920]   from incredibly smart people who help run institutions in New York City that you have
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:25.320]   actually heard of, and they have gotten to the end of the process and realized that they
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:30.280]   had no idea that they weren't going to get any discounts, and that their kid had applied
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.560]   to all of the wrong schools.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:39.040]   And they're just saying to me, "Ron, is there something you can do to help?"
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:48.400]   And after too many of these calls, I thought, wow, it is deeply problematic here that the
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.280]   system is so complicated.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:56.080]   And while I can't solve for that, I can certainly help pull the curtain back so that people
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:03.740]   know, first of all, how the system works, the best ways to get discounts most effectively,
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:10.080]   and how to shop for the sort of institutions that will give their kid everything that the
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:14.600]   kid needs, and at least some of what they want, and for people to know that they don't
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   have to spend $300,000 or anything close to that to accomplish those needs.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:27.340]   And once you're going into the process with a head of steam, and frankly, like a bobblehead
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:37.540]   style system-beating, question authority, question everything mindset, it actually starts
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:44.920]   to be fun again, and less about dread, and more about this incredible experience that
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:49.740]   you are going to be able to provide for your kid one way or the other that will change
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.940]   their life.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:57.280]   And as much as you may dread letting them go, you should also be excited and hopeful
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.840]   about the fact that you're able to provide it for them.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.860]   So I don't want this to be a downer.
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.340]   I don't want people to be angry by the end of the book.
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.380]   I want them to feel ready, right?
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:13.280]   And I want them to feel excited and jealous, frankly, that their kid gets to do this amazing
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   thing.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:19.160]   Well, the name of the book is The Price You Pay for College, an entirely new roadmap for
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:23.240]   the biggest financial decision your family will ever make by Ron Lieber.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:26.520]   Ron, thank you so much for being a guest today.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:32.540]   It's been a wonderful presentation, and we've all learned a lot.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.160]   It's a pleasure and an honor.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:41.560]   And I'm easy to find at ronlieber.com, you know, if you have questions or observations
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:46.520]   or ideas for additional avenues of exploration, you know, those ideas are gold to me.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520]   So thank you.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.280]   Thank you, Ron.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:48.780]   Thank you.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:58.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
