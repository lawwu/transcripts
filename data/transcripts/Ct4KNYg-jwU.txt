[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the Gospel according to St. Luke in chapter 14, verses 7 to 14.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Verses 7 to 14 in the 14th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms, saying unto them,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   When thou art bidden of any men to go to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room, lest the more honourable men than thou be bidden of him.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And he that bade thee and him come, and say unto thee, Give this man place, and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room, that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meet with thee. For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the lame, the lame, the blind, and thou shalt be blessed.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   For they cannot recompense thee, for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Now in that parable, which is in a sense a double parable, although I think as we shall see that our Lord is really making exactly the same point in the two sections of this one parable.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   In this parable and in what follows in this chapter, our Lord deals with what surely must be to anybody who has ever read the New Testament intelligently,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   a problem that stands out on the very surface of the record. And the problem is this.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Why was it that our blessed Lord and Saviour when he was in this world and on this earth, received the treatment that he did?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   John at the very beginning of his gospel says he came unto his own and his own received him not.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And that is of course what we read in the pages of the four gospels. Our Lord constantly met opposition.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   People were always arguing with him, trying to catch him and to trip him in his talk and in his teaching.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   His very miracles antagonized them.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Most of his short brief ministry of some three years was spent in argumentation with the scribes and the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the religious leaders of the people.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   They were always opposing him. And in the end, as we know, conspired together not only to reject him, but to kill him.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Now this, I say, surely ought to strike us all as a very astonishing problem.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   When you consider who he was, when you consider the marvel and the glory and the wonder of his person,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   you would have thought that immediately everybody would have recognized him and would have fallen at his feet and would have worshipped him
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and would have welcomed him and would have given themselves to him. The very glory of his person, you would have thought, would have been enough in and of itself.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And then when you consider his teaching, because as a Roman soldier who was once sent to arrest him said when he went back without him,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   "Never men spake like this, men."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Here was a teacher who didn't merely show his own learning, his own cleverness as the Pharisees and scribes did.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   They were learned men and they were always quoting their authorities and comparing and contrasting this and talking somewhere up in the air.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And the common people couldn't understand him, not follow him, follow them.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   But here is a teacher of whom we are told that he spake with authority and not as the Pharisees and scribes, that he spoke with simplicity.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   We are told about him that the common people heard him gladly.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Now I say it's amazing that with such a teacher, and when you consider what he taught,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   he said that he'd come to seek and to save that which was lost, that he hadn't come to destroy, but he had come to save men, he hadn't come to condemn.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And his teaching is incomparable in every respect.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You would have thought, I say, that men and women would have fallen at his feet and have worshipped him.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   But they didn't.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   They rejected him.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   They cried all together saying, "Away with him, crucify him."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And then when you consider his deeds, we are told that he went about doing good, and he did.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   He was one who relieved the sick, he healed the blind and the lame and the halt.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   He was always doing acts of mercy and of compassion.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   The world has never seen anybody who simply spent himself and gave himself in doing good,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   in doing acts of mercy and compassion and of kindness.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Here he is, the record is well known.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And yet, as I say, the effect of it all was that they took up stones and threw them at him.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And they hated him with a bitter hatred.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And they were not satisfied until finally they got rid of him and were responsible for his crucifixion.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Now, to me, this is a question that should engage all our attentions.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It's the great problem of history, if you like,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   that the Son of God, when he came into this world, was treated as he was.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Now, that, I say, is the problem that is dealt with in this chapter.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Why was this?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Why did they treat him like that?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   What was wrong with him?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   What was the matter with him?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Now, my friends, I needn't take any of your time tonight in reminding you and pointing out to you
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   that my only reason for raising this question with you and considering this problem with you
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   is because the same thing is true today.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   We are confronted by exactly the same position.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I'm never tired of reminding you of the mere statistics.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Only 10% of the people of this country even claim to be Christian.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   90% are not even interested, not concerned at all.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Only 10%.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And only half of that number attend any place of worship with any regularity Sunday by Sunday.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Now, here, you see, is exactly the same position.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And I suggest to you that this should be the most urgent problem
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   in the mind of every thinking person at this moment, with the world as it is.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Our world, as you look at it, internationally, politically, morally especially,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   with everything apparently breaking down,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   with all the efforts and the endeavors of men coming to nothing,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   why is it that they will not consider this message?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   What's the matter?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Why is it that the Lord Jesus Christ and his gospel are being dismissed,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   rejected, even as he was in the days of his flesh?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Well, I'm simply here to try to show you that the reasons tonight
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   are the same exactly as they've always been.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   That there is no difference at all.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And that if we want to understand the modern rejection of our Lord
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and of his gospel and of his teaching,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   the best thing we can do is to go back and to consider what he himself said about it.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And fortunately for us, he does so.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Many, many times he dealt with this very question
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and he showed perfectly plainly what it was that stood between people
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and belief in him, faith in him, and receiving the salvation
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   that he had come from heaven and earth in order to provide for men and women.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Now then, in this one chapter, as I say, he takes up this very point.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   He had been concerned in the previous chapter about his rejection,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   he'd been talking about his death,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   he'd been talking how it was essential for him to go to Jerusalem,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   he'd been warned by some people who said,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   "Get thee out and depart hence, for Herod will kill thee."
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And he said unto them, "Go ye and tell that fox,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   'Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   and the third day I shall be perfected.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Nevertheless, I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.'"
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And then he looks upon the city and he says,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and stonest them that are sent unto thee,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   how often would I have gathered thy children together
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   and ye would not.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Verily I say unto you, ye shall not see me until the time come
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   when ye shall say, 'Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.'"
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   You see, he's drawing to the end of his ministry.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   The rejection, the crucifixion are coming there at hand.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And he deals with this whole problem, and it arose in a particular way.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   He then went after saying that into a house of one of the chief Pharisees
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   to eat bread on the Sabbath day.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And everybody was watching him, and especially these Pharisees,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   because there was a man there suffering from dropsy,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   legs swollen, short of breath, suffering from dropsy.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Our Lord knew the minds of these lawyers and Pharisees,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   so he put a question to them saying,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?"
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And they held their peace.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And he took the men and healed him and let him go,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   and answered them saying, "Which of you shall have an ass or an ox
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   fall into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day?"
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And they could not answer him again to these things.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   See, they didn't believe in healing on the Sabbath day.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   It wasn't right to heal a sick man on the Sabbath day, that was work.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   But as he knew, their own Lord told them that if an ox or an ass fell into a pit,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   they were to pull him out, even though it was a Sabbath.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And thus, you see, he reveals the blindness of their hearts.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   They hated him for healing a man.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Here were people who were so punctilious about the letter that they forgot the Spirit.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Well, here he is in this house at this feast.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And then we are told that he made a certain observation.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   He put forth a parable to those which were bidden,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   when he marked how they chose out the chief rules,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   which means the chief places.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   You see, here was a man who had made a feast, a banquet,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   and he had got his tables arranged in the usual manner on such occasions.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   There was undoubtedly some sort of a high table,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and there were other tables that approximated to that.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And these were the best seats, and they were the best positions.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And our Lord just observed how these people who were bidden to the wedding
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   were choosing out the chief places, the best seats,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   putting themselves there and sitting down.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   He observed this.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And he spoke a parable,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   making use of this very fact in order to bring out his profound teaching,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   concerning himself and concerning his mission in this world,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and especially concerning this fact, why men and women refuse him and reject him.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   He then went on to speak another parable afterwards.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   A man sitting there sat at meat, heard these things,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and said, "Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And then he spoke another parable, "A certain man made a great supper," etc.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And then, having spoken that parable, he begins to speak very plainly to them,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   and seeing that there went great multitudes with him, he turned and said unto them,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   "If any man come unto me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And then he speaks a series of short parables.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Now, my case this evening is, my argument is,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   that in all these parables and teaching in this chapter,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   our Lord is really dealing with but one question.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And this one question is, "What is it that prevents men from believing in him
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   and receiving his great salvation? What is it?"
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And here, he expounds this and unfolds his teaching,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and picks out in particular three great principles.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Now, the first of them is the one I want to deal with tonight.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Why is it that men reject Christ?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   The answer that he gives us here in the first instance is,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   because they completely fail to understand the truth concerning themselves.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   They completely fail to understand the truth concerning themselves.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Now, look how he brings this out.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   You see, there he is in this banqueting hall. He's been invited there.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And he makes an observation. He sees these people all anxious to get to those best seats.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And they sit down there.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And that is the custom. He'd observed it many times.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And looking on at that, our Lord just sees a picture of life and a picture of men
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   and a picture of the whole tragedy of men.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   He says, "Now, there it is. This is the thing that causes men and women to reject my teaching and to reject me."
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   There is nothing that is more marvelous, as one reads the Gospels,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   as to notice the way in which our Lord was observant of everything.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And he used everything in order to bring out his teaching.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   He could use the picture of some sheep. He could use a picture of an orchard.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   He could use a picture of a farmer sowing seed into the ground.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Everything he saw seemed to him to be a parable of life and a parable of men.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And here he looks at these people in this banquet and observes their behavior.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And what he sees is this, the whole story of humanity.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   He says, "The human race is behaving with respect to me tonight,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   exactly as these people are behaving in this particular feast."
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Now, he gives his teaching, therefore, in terms of this very picture.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   What our Lord says, of course, is very good and very right, even on the ordinary human level.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   If you want a lesson in etiquette, you've got it here.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   If you want to know how to behave yourself, if you're invited to a wedding feast, read this parable.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But after all, that isn't the thing our Lord is concerned about. That isn't the thing he was interested in.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   This is a parable of something higher, something more important.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So he takes hold of it and he lifts it up to the spiritual level.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   He says, "What these people are doing on the natural level, they're doing on the spiritual level.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   And therefore, they don't believe in me and they reject my teaching and they're going to final perdition."
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Now, that is how the teaching is presented to us at this particular point.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And let me unfold it tonight, as let me divide it up into certain principles,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   as I see our Lord giving forth this momentous teaching.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   What is wrong with men, I say?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Why is it that men doesn't understand and submit himself to Christ and accept his salvation?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   What's the matter with him?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   What is it that accounts for this?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Well, I would divide up the answer as given in this parable, this first parable.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Let me divide it up tonight into two main sections, general and particular.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   There are certain general things which our Lord teaches us here about mankind, as it is by nature.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Man is lost, the world is in trouble, and yet it won't listen to the Son of God and his teaching.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Why not?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Well, the first answer is this.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Man bases his position entirely on his own opinions and his own ideas,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   without having any authority whatsoever behind it.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Here are a number of people, you see, invited to a feast.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And they decide themselves that they're going to take up their positions in the best seats.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Why do they do that? Who's told them to sit there? Nobody.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   There were no cards with their names on in those exalted seats at that high table.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   They decided that there were their seats.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Obviously, there was no question about this.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Those are my seats, said these people.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   There are our seats, and they go and they sit down in those positions.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   On what grounds?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   They've got no grounds, I say, except their own opinion.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   That is, their idea as to how the seating should be arranged at this particular banquet.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Nobody's given them authority, nobody's given them any instruction.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   They simply take the decision into their own hands.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   They say, "Obviously, that's where I ought to be sitting," and so they take their seats there.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Now, you know, that's the very thing that the Bible tells us about mankind from beginning to end.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Why is it that men and women tonight are not interested in God,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   and are not interested in the Lord Jesus Christ, and are not interested in the gospel?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   What's their reason? What are their grounds for doing so?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Why are people rejecting religion and the whole of Christianity?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   What's it based on?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Do you know the answer?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's based on nothing but their opinion.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Their idea.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I mean, they even say that.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   This is the argument, "I say, this is what I say, this is what I think."
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And they act on what they think, and on what they say.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   What is their authority?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   What are their sanctions for their position?
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   How can they back up their position?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   They can't do so.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   You see, we all, by nature, we start by rejecting God.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Oh, how often have I said that in this pulpit.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   We all know that period of adolescence.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   We were perhaps, many of us who are here tonight,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   we were forced to go to chapel and to Sunday school when we were children and young people,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   and we looked forward to the day when we could take this thing for ourselves,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   and we were going to be men.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And you proved that you were a man by stopping this, giving up religion,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   saying there was nothing in it, that it was all a lot of stuff and nonsense,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   mere tradition and blindness, and some kind of sub-stuff.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And we decided, on what grounds?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Had we read the Bible?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Did we know the case of the Bible?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Did we really know what salvation really is?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Of course we didn't.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   What had we read?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Had we read all the great books in the...
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Of course we hadn't.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   We simply said it.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   We took this opinion, we took this point of view,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and we were our own authorities, and we acted upon it.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Now that's what these people did in this banquet,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   and that is what mankind is still doing.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   This is one of the great tragedies of life at the present time,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   that men and women are simply saying,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   "20th century, of course we don't believe in it any longer.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Does anybody believe?"
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   It's mere declamation, it's mere statement.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   There is no authority whatsoever.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Mankind bases its position on nothing but its own opinions and its own ideas.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And then notice the assurance with which they do it.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   They actually take up the seats and they sit down in them.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   They act on their ideas,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and they do so, I say, with a strange assurance.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   It never occurs to them for a moment that they're wrong,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   it never occurs to them for a second that anything can possibly go wrong.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   They're absolutely complacent,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   they're seated at the best seats in the banquet chamber,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   and they're very pleased with themselves, and they're very happy,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   and they're looking forward to the proceedings.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   This is wonderful. They're taking it for granted, they're assuming it.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   And isn't that how men and women are living at the present time?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Life is a tremendous business,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   and it's never been more tremendous than it is today.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And there is nothing that is more obvious about the human race at this moment
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   than this extraordinary complacency.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   People thought that the wars were going to shake men and women out of their complacency.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I remember people saying at the beginning of the last war,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   "No, this is surely going to bring people to their senses."
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   In that interwar period, they thought they'd finished with war,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and we could understand them abandoning God and giving themselves to riotous living.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   But now it's come again, and it's going to shake them.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   But it hasn't shaken them.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Men and women take their seats in the best places in the banqueting chamber,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   perfectly happy, contented, complacent to all appearances,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   never imagining anything can go wrong,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   feeling that all is right, never had it so good.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Here we are in our affluent society.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   All is well. We take our seats.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   There they are.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   But then you see the third thing that strikes us and stands out
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   in such a remarkable manner in this whole picture is this,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   the awful insecurity of this position.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   They are not aware of it. Of course not.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   They are seated, I say, at the high table.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   They are seated in the best seats, and they can't imagine that anything is going wrong.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   But listen.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   "When thou art bidden, two of a men to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   lest a more honorable men than thou be bidden of him,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   and he that bed thee and him come and say unto thee,"
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   and their whole position is changed.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   "He says to thee, Give this men place, and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room."
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Oh, the Bible is full of this sort of picture.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Oh, the world in its complacency goes on and it laughs at God,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and it thinks all this is ridiculous, and so on and so forth,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   and isn't aware of its terrible insecurity.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   "But when they cry, Peace and safety, then cometh sudden destruction,"
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   says our Lord later on in this same Gospel.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Now, there it seems to me,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   the three general principles that our Lord teaches very plainly in this parable
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   that he spoke in that banqueting chamber.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And here I see men and women tonight in this country and in other countries,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   on a Sunday evening,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   sitting down, looking at the television, enjoying the fun and the laughter,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   sitting at the seaside playing games,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   never thinking about God, never thinking about the soul,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   never thinking about eternity, sitting down, all is well, wonderful,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   everything's all right, and they're not aware of this awful insecurity.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   They're not aware of the whole nature of life in which they're placed.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   They're not aware, as it were, that they're sitting on the edge of a volcano
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   that can go up at any moment.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   That's the thing that comes out in general in our Lord's teaching in this parable,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   but let me hasten to consider the particular principles.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Why is it possible that men can behave in this extraordinary manner?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   What accounts for this complacency, seated at the high table in the banquet,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   waiting for the meal, "It's going to be wonderful, everything's all right,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   and here we are, seated where we are to be."
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Why does mankind behave like this?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And our Lord answers the question.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   The first answer is that it's due to man's ignorance of himself.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Man finally rejects Christ and the Gospel because he is ignorant of himself.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   He doesn't know the truth about himself.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   What's his trouble? He overestimates himself.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   "He that however exalteth himself shall be abased,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Why did those people assume that those were their seats?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Why did they take their seats there in the best positions?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Well, the answer is they thought that, well, obviously there was no need to argue about this.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   They were the people for those positions.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   This is their own good conceit of themselves.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   It never occurs to them that they should be seated anywhere else.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Of course not. This is what I am.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   This is their own estimate of themselves.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   According to the teaching of this book, the Bible, man's ultimate trouble is his pride.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   You remember the first temptation, don't you?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   How the devil came to Eve and he said, "Yea, hath God said that you shall not eat of this fruit?"
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Don't you realize why he said that?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   He said that in order to keep you down.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   He knows perfectly well that the day in which you eat of that fruit,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   you will have your eyes opened and you will be as gods, and you were meant to be gods.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Why are you letting God keep you down like this?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Eat the fruit, assert yourselves, be what you are.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And they listened.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   The original sin, the first sin, was due to pride,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and this has been man's most essential trouble ever since then.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And this is the ultimate reason why men and women reject the Lord Jesus Christ and his gospel.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   That's why modern man is irreligious.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   It's this terrible pride which he has in himself.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   What's he proud of? Well, he's proud of his knowledge, of course.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   He's proud of his understanding. He's proud of his achievements.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   He is, after all, the twentieth century man.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   What a century! Look what we've done.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   We've harnessed the elements, we've split the atom,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   we've delved into the mysteries that our forefathers knew nothing at all about.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   We've advanced, we are understanding life itself.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   We claim we do, and so on.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And in the light of this, man is proud of his achievement.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   He's superior to all who have gone before him.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   He puts himself on a higher category.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Now, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   The modern man is doing exactly what these people did in the feast.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Modern man puts himself up on the top gallery.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   He says, "Our forefathers a hundred years ago, they knew a fair amount,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   but they didn't know what we know.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   It was all right to be religious a hundred years ago, but not now.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Look what we've done, look what we have."
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   And then people before that, they were down there,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and others in the basement, and down and down you go.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Man puts himself, modern man puts himself,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   he's man of come of age, isn't he?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   He's man of knowledge.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   He's an intellect. He's a brain. He's a reader. He knows.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   That's why he isn't religious.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   You see where he puts himself?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   He's proud of himself.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   And he puts himself into this exalted position
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   in terms of his knowledge and his understanding.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And he's equally proud of his goodness.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   He says, "You know, I'm not a hundred percent saint, but..."
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   You know, he's very good after all.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   He says, "People used to be very cruel to one another,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   but we've become very kind,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   and we are concerned about people in need, and so on.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Look at the acts of Parliament we've passed.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   How could people treat one another as they used to?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   But look what we've done.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Look at the provision we've made.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   How kind we are, how good we are, how wonderful we are.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   We're always helping one another.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   We don't need a gospel because we've done away with the need of it.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   We're also good and kind and helping one another."
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   That's another feather he puts into his cap
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   as he takes his seat in the best position,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   the best that the world has ever known.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And, of course, he's supremely confident
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   in his power to order his own life
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and to order the life of the whole world.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And this is finally why men dismisses religion,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   dismisses Christ, dismisses God.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   He regards it as an insult.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   He said, "People in the past, of course,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   they were ignorant and they were dark,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   they were blinded and they were weak
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   and they didn't understand and they didn't know.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   But we know this idea," he says,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   "that men should bow before any God
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and worship Him and ask Him for help.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Men doesn't need help.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Why don't you assert yourself?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Why don't you stand up to life?"
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   says the modern man.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "I don't need God. He doesn't need any help."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And then the Bible talks about sin.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   And if there is one thing that the modern man hates,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   it's this whole biblical teaching about sin.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He says, "You know, that tells you that you can't trust yourself.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   It tells you that you're rotten, that you're ugly,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   that you're vile, that you're foul.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   You're an aspersion on human nature.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Man is a noble creature.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   He's not what the Bible says.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And we don't like this doctrine of sin."
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Have I reminded you before of a man
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   holding this typical modern view of men?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I'm sorry to say that he said it in a pulpit.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And he thought he was being very clever as he said it.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He took up that hymn, "Jesus, lover of my soul,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   let me to thy bosom fly."
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And he pulled out particularly the verse which says this,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   "Just and holy is thy name.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   I am all unrighteousness.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Vile and full of sin I am.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Thou art full of truth and grace."
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   He said, "It's a lie."
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   He said, "Not only is it a lie, it's nonsense."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   He said, "Can you imagine a man applying for a job
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   or applying for a post
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   and going to his prospective employer and saying,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   'Vile and full of sin I am,'
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   and depreciating himself and saying that he's no good?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   'Of course you can't,' he said.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   'Why should men say that to God, therefore?'"
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   You see, they hate the biblical teaching of sin.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   They say that men should not be put down into the lowest place.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Man is such a fine fellow.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   He's such a good creature.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   He should be seated at the highest place.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Man is good.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   There's no such thing as evil.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   There's no such thing as sin.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   That's merely the absence of certain qualities
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   or that man doesn't have time to develop them.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   But he's got it in him.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Man's not bad.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Man is essentially good, they say.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   So they hate the biblical doctrine of sin
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and feel that they're free from it.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And what they hate above everything else
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   is the biblical doctrine of salvation.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And that is why they rejected the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   and his teaching, and especially his teaching
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   about his death upon the cross.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And that is why they hated it when it was preached to them
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   by people like the apostle Paul and others.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   They went around preaching Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And they hated him. Why?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Well, it was a stumbling block to the Jews
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   and it was foolishness to the Greeks.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Why?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Well, you see, it's a doctrine which says this,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   that man is in such a state and condition
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   that he cannot save himself.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Indeed, that he is so black and so vile
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   that the very Son of God had to come from heaven
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   and be born as a man.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And not only that, he had to die a cruel death upon a cross
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   before men could be rescued and redeemed,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   pardoned and restored.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And the modern man revolts against it.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   He says, "This is an insult. That's not me.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I belong there, top table, and you're putting me down.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   You're saying I'm a vile sinner."
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   He hates it and he rejects this Christ
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   and especially the blood of his cross.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It is all, you see, because of his good conceit of himself.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It is because he's exalting himself.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   It is because he thinks he deserves the best seat
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   in the banqueting chamber and puts himself there.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   But you see, our Lord's whole teaching is to disabuse men of this.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   "He that exalteth himself," he says, "shall be abased.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   But he that abases himself or humbles himself shall be exalted."
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   What's it mean? Well, it means this,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   that men's good conceit of himself is his greatest fallacy,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   that the truth about him is that he is appallingly ignorant,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   that all the advances of science don't add at all
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   to men's knowledge of that which is most essential.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   What is man? What is life?
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   How can I live as I ought to?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   What is death? What lies beyond it?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Modern science doesn't help me.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   These are the things I want to know.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   How can I live as a man?
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   How can I conquer evil and sin within me?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   How can I be at peace with myself and others?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Man doesn't know. He's ignorant.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   He thinks he knows, but when you examine the situation,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   he reveals that he doesn't know.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   If man is all that he claims to be,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   why is his world as it is?
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Is man a success?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Look at the world, read your newspapers,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   see the problems arising one after another,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   the ignorance, the failure.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   What of man's power to save himself?
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   He doesn't want to save himself.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   "I'm my own saviour," he says.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   "Trust yourself, express yourself."
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   But can he?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   The truth about man, says our Lord, is that he is helpless,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   that he is not only weak, but he is utterly helpless.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And all the centuries of civilization
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   and of acts of Parliament and of learning
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   and of knowledge and of culture
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   leave man in his utter helplessness
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   as he has been ever since the fall.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   And on top he is selfish,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   stammering for the best seat,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   pushing others back, pushing himself forward.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Isn't this life?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Read the biographies, read the autobiographies.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Look at these men belonging to the same political parties.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   You'd think they're the greatest friends.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   You wait until they die and you read the biographies.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   You'll find they were ready to cock one another's throats.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Every man pushing himself forward, looking over his shoulder.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   This man's a colleague, yes, but he may have a dagger.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   And so they're all watching them,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   everyone pushing for the best seat.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Isn't that life?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   You see, it's all due to ignorance.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Man is a fraud.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Even his best actions are not disinterested.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   He says, "What am I going to get out of this?
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   This will come back to me."
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   The Bible says that man is an awful fraud.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And I say the literature of mankind
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   reveals exactly the same thing.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   The apostle Paul sums it up in writing to Titus,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   says, "We were once ourselves hateful and hating one another."
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Man puts himself in the best seat because he doesn't know himself.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   It's his ignorance that puts him there.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   If only he knew the truth about himself.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   But he doesn't.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   He sits there because of his radically wrong and false estimate of himself.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   But let me hurry to the second thing,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   which is even more serious, so alarmingly serious.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   It isn't his own ignorance of himself.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   It is his ignorance of God.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   You see, here's the picture.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   "When thou had bidden of a many men to a wedding,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   sit not down in the highest room."
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Why not?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   "Well, lest a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him."
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   The man was making the feast.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   "And he that bade thee and him come and say unto thee,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   'Give this man place,' and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room."
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   You see, this is the picture, isn't it?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Here you are, two of you have been invited to this same feast.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   And you, in your anxiety and your eagerness,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   happen to arrive there before the other men.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And of course, you assume that that's your place,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   the best place in the whole banquet.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Of course.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The man who doesn't realize that that's your place,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   well, he's just an ignoramus, or he's very jealous of you or something.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   That is obviously your place.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   You're the best men, so you take your seat there.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And you sit down, and you're waiting for the proceedings.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   But suddenly the man who is giving the feast arrives.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   And it's his feast.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And it is the privilege of the man who's making and giving the feast
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   to decide where people sit.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   The guests don't decide where they sit.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   You'd have nothing but constant warfare if that were the position.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Everybody'd want the best place.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   So it is the privilege of the host to decide where people sit.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   And there you are, you see, seated in the best place.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   But suddenly the host comes in.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And he says, "That's not your place.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   That is this man's place.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Go from there. That's your place."
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   The maker of the feast, the giver of the feast, arrives.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And whatever you may have thought about yourself and what was your right,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   it's suddenly completely undermined, and you've got to move.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   You begin, he says, with shame to take the lowest rule.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   And everybody's looking on and seeing it happening to you.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   What was the matter with this man who sat in the best seat?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Well, you see, he not only overestimated himself,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   he forgot that it wasn't his feast.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   He forgot the host.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   He forgot whose feast it was.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   And the great message of the Bible is just to say this.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   It is God's feast.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   My dear friend, this is God's world.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   It isn't yours. It isn't mine.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   It's God's world. He made it.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   He is the creator. He is the sustainer of everything.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   He made you. He gave you life.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Your life is in his hands.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   We all belong to him and not to ourselves.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   The whole universe is God's.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   And he reigns over all and he rules over all.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   It's his feast.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   And we're all in his hands.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   And it is he who decides what happens to us.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Oh, I say again, this is the tragedy of the human race.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Our Lord kept on repeating this.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Listen to how he put it on another occasion.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   You'll find it in the 17th chapter of this same gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   "As it was in the days of Nau before the flood,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   even so shall it be in the days of the son of men.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   and knew not until the flood came,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and carried them all away."
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Can't you see it? The banquet.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Eating and drinking, marrying, giving in marriage,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   complacent, everything all right.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   A fool of the name of Nau had been preaching for 120 years
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   and he was prophesying that a great calamity was going to happen,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   that God was going to judge the world.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Who is this eccentric, this fool who still believes in God and in judgment?
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Why? Everything's all right. Look at it.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Look at the food, look at the drink, look at the sideboards.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   We are in a banqueting chamber.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Eating, drinking, marrying, giving in marriage.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   What's the matter? What's wrong?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   What do you say we should be doing? On with the dance.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   You see this same complacency, this same fatal assumption,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   this same foolish belief that the world was theirs
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   and that they could do what they liked in it?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Even, he says, as they were in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   There again he says they were doing the same thing,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   planting, sowing, buying and selling.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   A typical picture of the modern world,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   modern man with his affluence, with his industry, everything going well,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   the complacency and the assurance and the assumption that it's all
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   and that man is everything, that man is the center of the universe
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   and that science is in control and that there's nothing else.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   And then suddenly the maker and the giver of the feast appears.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   That's the whole trouble, according to our Lord, with the human race.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   It is the master of the feast who decides our positions, not we ourselves.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   My dear friend, it doesn't matter what you think of yourself.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   It doesn't matter what I think of myself.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   It doesn't matter what we think of one another.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   There's only one thing that matters.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   What does God think of me?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   You and I will soon be dead and our bodies will be rotting in a grave.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   What the whole universe thinks of me doesn't matter at all.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Nothing matters but his opinion.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   It is his feast. We are in his world.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   He decides. He is the judge of all the earth.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   He made it. He controls it. It all belongs to him.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   It is in his hands.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Let me remind you as this parable teaches us that his standard of judgment isn't yours and mine.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   These people thought that they were entitled to the best room in the banquet.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   The master of the feast doesn't agree and he makes the move.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   His judgment isn't their judgment.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   It's here on the surface.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   The man said, "That's obviously my place."
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   The master of the feast comes and says, "Girl!"
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   And you've got to go.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Listen to our Lord putting it on another occasion.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   He looked into the eyes of the Pharisees and he said, "You are they that justify yourselves before men.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   But God seeth the heart, for that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of God."
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Now I'm not saying that. It's the Son of God who says that.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   You see, these Pharisees, they made broad their phylacteries and they were teachers of the people.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   And the people revered them.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   They thought they were marvelous.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Our Lord says, "You know, they're looking at the outside. God seeth the heart.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of God."
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   There are men who recently died and they could speak blasphemously just before they died.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   They said, "I've conquered this realm. I've conquered that realm.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Where do I start again? Where am I to start next as an amateur?"
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   That's how they speak about going out of life to meet God and standing before the Eternal.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   The arrogance, the self-confidence.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Of course, they have great obituary notices.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Half an hour on the television, the world says, "Greatness!"
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   But it's abomination in the sight of God.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   His judgment is not our judgment.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   The Apostle Paul says, "Be not deceived. God is not mocked.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   All things are naked and open unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   You and I can put up a great show.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   We're all shams. We're all frauds.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   But we're all very clever.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   If only people knew us as we are.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   If they knew every thought you've had today, every imagination,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   every subtle thing that's come into your heart or into your mind.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   What if people knew it?
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   What if they could analyze your very best deeds and see your motives and your purposes
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   and your objectives?
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   What if men could tear off the mask of all the polite and the nice people
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   and see what's really behind it?
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Oh, what a difference! But God sees that.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   All things are naked and open unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   It's His feast. He decides. It is His judgment.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   And His judgment is the exact opposite of ours.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   But listen to this.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   He has power to enforce His judgment because it is His feast.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   He that bade thee and him shall come and say unto thee,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   "Give this man place!"
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   And you have no right in a feast to say, "I object to that. This is my position.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   I'm better than that man."
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   It is His feast. It isn't yours.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   And that's His judgment and He's got power to enforce it.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   "Give this man place!"
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And you've got to go.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And my dear friend, this is what I cannot understand
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   of men and women who blaspheme the name of God and reject this Christ and His wonderful salvation,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   that they dare speak as they do.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   When God tells you to go out of this world, you'll have to go,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   though you're a twentieth century man,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   and though you've got a national health service,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   and though you've got these miracle drugs.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   When God tells you to go, you will just have to go.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   And they will be no arguing at the bar of final judgment.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   It is God's judgment.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   And God's sentence, when it's promulgated, will have to be carried out.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   "Give this man place!"
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   And no objection, no resistance is possible.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   No appeal is possible.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   You just have to go.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   He not only has the judgment, He has the power of judgment,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   and He can enforce it, and He will enforce it.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   The teaching of the whole book from beginning to end.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   It is especially the teaching of His own Son.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And look, my dear friends, at the result of the judgment,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   the result of the pronouncement.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   "And thou begin with shame."
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   "To take the lowest rule."
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   "Bind him with hand and foot and cast him far."
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   What a terrible thing it is for a man to wake up in eternity
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   and find that he's been a fool, that he's been all wrong.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   That he rejected the gospel that could save him,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   he rejected the life that would lead to glory,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   simply because of his wrong estimate of himself,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   and because of his complacency,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   because of his self-assurance,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   because he forgot that it was God's world,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   and that it's God who decides.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   The shame of it all.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   "Away from me."
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   "I never knew you."
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   "Ye that work iniquity."
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Oh, my dear friends,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   our Lord teaches us in this parable
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   that God's judgment is absolute,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   and that unless we have obeyed Him
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   and listened to His Son and received His salvation,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   we shall go to everlasting shame
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   and everlasting destruction
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   from the presence of the Lord.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Oh, these foolish people.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   They were wrong in their estimates of themselves,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   and they'd forgotten all about God,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   and that it's His banquet,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   and that it is His judgment that counts,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   and that He's got power to enthrall it.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   But lastly, for me to close,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   finally, mankind is ignorant of what God really wants
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   and what God's way.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   And you see, it's the exact opposite
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   of all we naturally think.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   "He that humbleth himself shall be abased."
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   "He that exalted himself shall be exalted."
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Listen, says our Lord,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   "When ye are bidden to a feast,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   "go and sit in the lowest room,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   "that when He that bid thee cometh,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   "He may say unto you, Friend, go up higher.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   "Then thou shalt have worship, honor."
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   And in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   He says the same to the men who makes the feast.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   "When thou makest a dinner or a supper,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   "don't only call your friends and brethren
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   "or your kinsmen or your rich neighbors,
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   "lest they also bid thee again
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   "and make a recompense unto thee."
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   He doesn't say you should never invite your friends and relatives.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   He says don't only invite them.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   But instead of that, He says invite also
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Why?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Well, He says that's the way to be blessed.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   They can't return it to you.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   They can't invite you back.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   They can't make any recompense to thee
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   like the other people can.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Do it like that, and then thou shalt be recompensed
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   at the resurrection of the just.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   What does it mean?
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   It means this.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Nothing is so important for us in this life
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   and in this world as to listen to the teaching
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   of the Son of God.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   "Humble yourselves," He says.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   What's He mean?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Is this false modesty?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   No, no.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   What He means is what He said in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   "Blessed are the poor in spirit."
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Theirs is the kingdom of God.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   The poor in spirit.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   What is this?
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Not false modesty, I say.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Not pretending to humble yourself
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   and thinking all the time,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   "Oh, I can afford to stand back there.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   "I am obviously the greatest man in the place,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   "and the host is bound to come to me
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   "and take me up to the top."
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   No, no, that's not His teaching.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   It's our Lord's teaching about the two men
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   who went up into the temple to pray,
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   the one a publican and the one a Pharisee.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   The Pharisee, you remember, went right to the front
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   and he said, "God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   "and especially as this publican.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   "I fast twice in the week.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   "I give a tenth of my goods to the poor.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   "I thank You that I am what I am.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   "I don't need anything from You.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   "I don't need grace.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   "I don't need forgiveness.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   "I don't need compassion.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   "I need nothing.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   "I am all right.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   "I thank You that I am the wonderful man I am."
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   Here you see.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   The poor publican was there just inside the door,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   so utterly ashamed of himself
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   that he was there with his head down,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   smiting his breast and all he could say,
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   "God, be merciful to me, O sinner.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   "It's my only hope.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   "I can't forgive myself.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   "Can you?
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   "I'm so rotten.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   "I'm so vile.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   "I see what I am."
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Now that's what our Lord is speaking about.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   That's what He means when He tells us that we must humble ourselves.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   It means that you should face God and face Him,
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   face His teaching, face yourself honestly,
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   and then you'll find the rottenness and the vileness,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   the weakness, the hopelessness,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   and you'll say quite honestly,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   "Just as I am without one plea,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   "but that Thy blood was shed for me
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   "and that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   "O Lamb of God, I come.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   "I've got nothing.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   "Nothing in my hands I bring.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   "Simply to Thy cross I cling,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   "naked come to Thee for dress,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   "helpless look to Thee for grace.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   "Foul to the fountain fly.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   "Wash me, Savior,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   "or I die."
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   The Son of God has no blessing to give you
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   until you've come to that.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   If you've got any pride of knowledge left in you,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   if you've got any pride in your morality and goodness left in you,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   if you've got any pride in the fact that you belong to the 20th century left in you,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   you're outside and you'll be put out.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   The only man who's blessed is the man who realizes his need,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   a broken and a contrite heart.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Thou shalt not despise.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   You read the lives of the best men that the world has ever seen.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   They are always the men who have condemned themselves.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   They are the men who say they are the chief of sinners with the Apostle Paul.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   They've looked into the law of God.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   They've looked into the face of God.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   They've seen Christ and they've shriveled to nothing.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   And they are nothing and nobody.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   They're done.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   That's the man who's blessed,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   not the man who puts himself in the best seat.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   What else does he look for?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   Well, you see, he commends the man
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   who doesn't covet great things for himself in this world.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   He said to these same Pharisees,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   "How can you believe that receive honor of one of another
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?"
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   If you are living this worldly life of honoring one another
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   and praising one another, you're outside.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   You mustn't be interested in that.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   You invite these poor and maimed and lame and blind
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   who can't receive you back and who can't honor you.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   And you mustn't do good, he says, in order to be seen of others,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   in order to get their praise.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   It would be like the Pharisee standing on the street corners
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   making broad their phylacteries,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   offering their long prayers that they may be seen
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   and heard of men and praised of men.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   "Verily I say unto you," he says, "if that's what you're after,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   you'll get it.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   You'll get your reward.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   If you're out for worldly fame and honor, you'll get it.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   You'll get an obituary in the Times.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   You'll be a great man, perhaps, and the world will praise you.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   If you're out for that, you'll get your reward,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   and that's all you will get.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   A temporary seat in a place you don't belong to,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   but only a temporary one.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   What is the secret?
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Oh, the secret is this,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   that a man should have his eye on the resurrection of the just.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   When thou makest a feast for the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   and thou shalt be blessed,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   for they cannot recompense thee,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   That's the man.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   The man whose eye is on God,
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   and not on men.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   The man who is like Moses,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   who refused when he became of age to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   What was his secret?
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Oh, he had his eye, we are told, on the recompense of the reward.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   He went on, he lived, seeing him who is invisible.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   He didn't look at Egypt and its armies,
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   and the generalship of the army, which could have been his,
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   and the crown, perhaps, and the great pomp and authority.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   He put it all aside and became a common shepherd,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   and suffered and endured the contradiction of those children of Israel,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   and all the bother and the shame of it all.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Why did he do it?
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Oh, he had his eye on the recompense of the reward.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   Not to have the best place in the banquet of this world,
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   but just to be inside the door of heaven.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Now, my friends, what's your estimate of yourself?
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   What's your view of life in this world?
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   What are you out for?
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   On what is your eye fixed?
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   Is it this world and its estimates?
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   It's all going to come to nothing.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   The master of the feast will come.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   He's the son of God.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   He is the bridegroom, and there's going to be a great feast.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   He'll come.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Is your eye fixed on death?
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   And are you waiting for this blessed word?
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   Friend, friend, come up higher.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   Come to be with me.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Come and sit at my right hand.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Come and share in the everlasting feasting of my kingdom of glory,
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   and of honor, and of dominion, and of might.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Come!
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   Are you waiting for that?
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   You prove that you are waiting for that by facing yourselves honestly
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   in the sight of this word, in the sight of the Son of God.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Heaven and earth shall pass away, he says,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   but my words shall not pass away.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   Are you with this foolish world tonight,
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   sitting in complacency in the high places?
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   I say again, face yourself in the light of this teaching.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   Face yourself. Recognize your sin.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   Go to him as you are.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Plead for just mercy and compassion.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Take your place with the public and say,
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   "God, be merciful to me, O sinner."
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   And then he will tell you, "I have been.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   I sent my only begotten Son into the world to die for you.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   He died that you might be forgiven.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   He died to make you good.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   He died to prepare you for the eternal banquet in heaven."
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   Amen.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
