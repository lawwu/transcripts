[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.320]   Welcome to Bogle Heads on Investing, podcast number 52.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.920]   Today we're talking about a special topic, estate planning,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.080]   with estate planning attorney Ryan Barrett and author and CPA
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.040]   Mike Piper.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:32.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.400]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.040]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.760]   of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.880]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.400]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.080]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.280]   dedicated to helping people make better financial decisions.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.080]   Visit our newly designed website at boglecenter.net
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.720]   to find valuable information and to make
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.800]   a tax-deductible contribution.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.040]   Today our discussion is all about estate planning.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.000]   This is probably one of the most important and the most
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   overlooked aspect of a financial plan.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.760]   I find that about 50% of my new high net worth clients
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.920]   have either no estate plan or have an estate plan that
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.320]   is either out of date or have done some estate planning
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.200]   but have not completed it.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.600]   And that could create a lot of problems for their heirs.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.160]   We're going to hear about this today from two guests.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.880]   My first guest is Ryan Barrett, who
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.560]   is a member of the California Bar and the Utah Bar.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.160]   He works with clients in both states.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.680]   Second is Mike Piper.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.520]   Mike is a CPA and the author of many tax books as well as
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.200]   investing books.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.360]   He's also the author of the popular blog
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   ObliviousInvestor.com.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.400]   And he is the creator of the Open Social Security Calculator
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.880]   at OpenSocialSecurity.com.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.420]   Mike's latest book is titled After the Death of Your Spouse,
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.200]   Next Financial Steps for Surviving Spouses.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.040]   Putting a copy of this short paperback book
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.280]   with your estate planning documents
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.720]   will probably save your surviving spouse
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.480]   thousands of hours of time and thousands of tears
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.160]   because Mike has made this information available
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.560]   in an easy and understandable way.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.200]   So with no further ado, let me introduce
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.480]   Ryan Barrett and Mike Piper.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.000]   Welcome to the Bogleheads on Investing podcast.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.200]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   Thanks, Rick.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.040]   So before we get started, I always
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.560]   like our guests to talk a little bit about themselves.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.800]   So I'll start with Ryan.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.640]   You have been an attorney for more than 10 years.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.440]   Why specialize in estate planning?
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.560]   Estate planning, I got actually drawn in
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.880]   through financial planning when I
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.200]   worked with my financial advisor to sort of set up
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.000]   my financial plan.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.400]   Just the idea of helping somebody
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.280]   plan for their future and then also the unexpected.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.880]   But estate planning was a little more my wheelhouse
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.400]   just because I had a law degree and the background in that.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.680]   So getting out of litigation, out of the adversarial,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.600]   and into more just working with somebody
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.520]   and helping them prepare for something that's
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.360]   going to benefit them and their beneficiaries.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.200]   And you say that your goal is to be
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.680]   able to bring estate planning to the masses.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.440]   Could you explain that a little bit?
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.840]   Well, I think estate planning can be a little intimidating
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.000]   for a lot of people.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.320]   They come to a firm that handles estate planning
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.080]   and they don't really know what it's going to cost.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.440]   A lot of times firms don't have fixed prices up front.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.040]   They bill hourly.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.480]   They have a retainer agreement.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.160]   And I like to target the audience that
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.560]   doesn't have the extremely complex estate plans.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.600]   We're not getting into asset protection.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.480]   People with that many assets and go that avenue
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.240]   are usually-- well, they usually already have attorneys.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.600]   So the person that thinks maybe they need an estate plan,
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.240]   and I think most people do, have a simple approach,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.000]   fixed prices, let them know what their options are,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.640]   try and be as un-intimidating as possible
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.640]   and as upfront and straightforward as possible
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.400]   so people know exactly what they're getting into
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.080]   and what it's going to cost them.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.720]   You are licensed to practice law in California and Utah.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.760]   But unlike other professions like the investment advisory
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.880]   profession, you can't go outside those states.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.920]   Is that correct?
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.800]   That's correct, yeah.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.640]   As long as you reside in California and Utah,
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.560]   then I'm more than happy to help you.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.240]   But outside of that, can't do much.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.720]   And Mike, you're a repeat guest.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.880]   Thanks for coming back.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.200]   You are CPA, and your latest endeavor
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.400]   is a great little book called After the Death of Your Spouse.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.640]   I mean, the title is not appealing, but--
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.280]   Right, right.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.040]   It's not a happy topic, obviously.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.400]   After the Death of Your Spouse, The Next Financial Steps
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.600]   for Surviving Spouses, which is a fantastic resource.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.200]   I mean, I really believe that people should just
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.160]   buy the paperback edition of this book,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.360]   and it's not very much, and just stick it
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.920]   in your estate planning documents,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.040]   because there's so much information in this book.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.640]   But why did you decide to go down this path
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.560]   after a lot of books on taxes, and a lot of books
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.400]   on accounting, and then investing,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.360]   and now estate taxes?
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.920]   So what caused you to take this pivot?
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.800]   Mostly, it was just seeing these situations where
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.480]   when a person's spouse dies, they're suddenly--
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.280]   from an emotional and psychological point of view,
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.800]   it's one of the hardest times in their life,
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   if not the very hardest time in their life.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.280]   And then the way our system is set up,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.560]   at that very same moment, they have
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.120]   this huge list of administrative and financial to-do items
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.480]   just dropped in their lap, basically when they're quite
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.440]   possibly the worst time to have to deal
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.680]   with a whole bunch of things.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.560]   And now they do have to deal with a whole bunch of things.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.040]   And then in a lot of cases, it's made worse by the fact
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.880]   that in a lot of households, one of the two spouses
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.160]   will take the lead on financial matters.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.760]   And of course, it's a 50/50 chance
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.560]   that it's the other spouse who's the surviving spouse.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.280]   And so in a lot of cases, they now
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.920]   have all these things to deal with,
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.360]   and they don't have all of the skills and experience built up
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.200]   over decades that the other spouse would have.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.280]   So the point of the book is basically
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   just to walk people through it in plain language.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.720]   Let's start with a simple question about what
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.400]   is an estate plan, and why should people
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.880]   have an estate plan?
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.080]   So I'm going to go to Ryan, our attorney expert on this.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.520]   And Ryan, tell me why you even have an estate plan.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.200]   Well, an estate, to start, is just what your assets are
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.400]   at the time of your death.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.920]   So an estate plan is essentially a plan in place
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.680]   that you make before your death for what
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.280]   will happen with those assets when you do pass.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.240]   There are a number of reasons to have an estate plan.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.900]   It will obviously vary person to person,
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.160]   complexity of their estate, and the extent of their estate.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.040]   At the most basic level, it's a will,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.200]   which just says where you want what assets to go.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.320]   Beyond that, you have trust and other avenues
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.040]   for distributing assets that will have tax consequences.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.280]   They'll avoid probate.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.520]   It's important to plan for your children,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.880]   if you have minor children.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.560]   Not necessarily what assets they'll get,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.000]   but who will take care of them.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.640]   It's, one, to ensure that your wishes are carried out
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.480]   upon your passing, but also, two,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.280]   just to make things easier on those that survive you,
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.760]   so that there's no fighting, there's
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.400]   no question what will happen.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.020]   Well, let me ask a question about that,
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.960]   because ironically, the clients that I deal with,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.640]   I'm rather shocked by the number of high net worth individuals
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.480]   who don't even have a will.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.100]   They don't have other documents, like guardianship instructions
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.000]   for their children.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.480]   What happens to all of their assets and their children
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.360]   if they don't have an estate plan,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.680]   if they don't have the documents?
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.360]   What happens?
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.080]   Separating those from the assets and your children,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.400]   your assets will be distributed according
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.600]   to what are called intestate laws.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.640]   So intestate means dying without a will,
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.880]   and so each state has its own intestate laws,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.760]   although they're fairly similar.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.600]   So in Utah, that would be, if you're married
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.280]   and you don't have children from a previous marriage,
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.360]   your wife gets everything.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.800]   So it's pretty simple.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.040]   If you do have children from a previous marriage,
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.960]   then your wife would get $75,000,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.420]   and then half of the remaining assets, and so on and so forth.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.560]   It gets confusing the more people are either not
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.800]   surviving you or otherwise.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   And then your children, well, guardianship
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.240]   will be determined by the court.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.040]   Can I ask you a question about that?
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.120]   Stop right there.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.480]   So guardianship will be determined by the court,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.360]   but it's not like you get in a car wreck with your spouse
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.640]   and your young children are maybe with a babysitter.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.320]   And unfortunately, you and your spouse pass away,
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.760]   and guardianship will be determined by the court.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.920]   But what happens in the meantime?
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.240]   I mean, what happens to these children?
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.800]   There's short-term guardianship and then
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.760]   long-term guardianship.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.200]   So in the short term, if there's no one
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.120]   available to take them, then they'd
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.280]   be cared for by the state.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.120]   They'd either go to a home or child care services.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.560]   Long term, you go through the process in court.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.480]   So somebody would begin that process
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.720]   by filing a petition for guardianship.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   And that can be literally anyone.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.680]   It can be one of your surviving siblings.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.720]   It can be your parents.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.760]   And then the court will review whoever
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   requests to be guardian and then make a determination based
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.560]   on what's in the best interest of the child.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.840]   So that can get confusing and complicated
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.280]   when multiple people come forward.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.640]   It can get very emotional.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.240]   Everyone thinks that they are the best
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.840]   person for the children.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.960]   But ultimately, yes, it's the court's decision
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.880]   who will take those children.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.800]   Well, Malik, let me ask you, when
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.200]   it comes to financial matters, one of the documents
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.640]   that we're told we should have is a durable power of attorney.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.200]   What does that do?
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.680]   Yeah, just in general, a power of attorney
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.400]   allows somebody else to make decisions on your behalf.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.720]   So in this case, we're talking about financial decisions.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.880]   So for instance, if you become incapacitated, not death,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.000]   but something else happens to you,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.320]   this would allow the person who you
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   name that would give them the ability to make investment
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.760]   decisions or have control over your checking account and things
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.720]   like that so that your bills can still get paid and so on.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.640]   Ryan, what about a medical power of attorney?
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.760]   Why is that important?
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   Medical power of attorney is when you're incapacitated,
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.720]   it sets forth who could make decisions when you can't make
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.040]   decisions for yourself, under what conditions
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.920]   that power transfers.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.480]   Then you have the decision what sort of care
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.320]   can be provided, end of life decisions,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.120]   when somebody is on life support,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.960]   situations like that.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.080]   OK, let's get into the concept of a trust.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.480]   A lot of people set up trusts.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.680]   A lot of people don't set up trusts.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.480]   What are the main reasons why someone would set up a trust?
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.960]   And very broadly, different types
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.800]   of trusts they could set up.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.480]   Sure.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.640]   The idea of a trust is it's a financial arrangement
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.440]   where somebody else has control over your assets
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.520]   for the benefit of a beneficiary.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.160]   So there are different types of trusts.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.280]   In a living trust, usually the trustor,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.920]   it's the person who sets up the trust, will also be the trustee.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.160]   And the trustee is the person who manages the trust.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.280]   They'll be the trustee for their lifetime.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.320]   And then upon death, usually that responsibility
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.160]   transfers to somebody else.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.960]   And the idea of a trust in that situation
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.840]   is you're taking the assets technically away
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.120]   from the person that owns them.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.320]   So when they die, there's no transfer of those assets
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.040]   from that trustor to the other party.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.800]   So they don't have to go through probate.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.160]   So that's one of the biggest advantages
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.960]   of having a trust, especially in California
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.160]   where the probate process is really long.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.600]   Whatever assets are in that trust
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.840]   just get transferred automatically.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.720]   So it's much smoother.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.560]   It's much quicker.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.840]   You don't need the court to intervene.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.600]   It's less costly.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.160]   There's a number of different trusts.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.120]   As I mentioned, there's a living trust.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.200]   There's a testamentary trust, which
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.040]   is a trust that doesn't really come into being
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.240]   until the person is deceased.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.240]   So that doesn't have the advantage of avoiding probate
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.640]   because the property doesn't actually fund the trust
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.080]   until you already pass.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.840]   Revocable trusts are the most common.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.680]   That's where you can create the trust,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.760]   but you remain the trustee.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.120]   And you can cancel the trust at any time.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.840]   You can make changes throughout your life.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.720]   And it doesn't really become irrevocable until you pass.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.560]   And then the other end, there's irrevocable trusts,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.320]   which completely remove the assets from you,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.640]   from your control.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.880]   They're usually managed by a business.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.520]   And that has a lot of advantages for what protects you
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.760]   from creditors because you literally
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.600]   don't own the assets anymore.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.840]   So they can't come after the assets
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.880]   if there was a lawsuit, something like that.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.440]   That's good.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.720]   I know there's just an infinite--
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   I mean, it seems like an infinite number of ways
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.800]   to write trust depending on what your needs are.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.400]   Mike, do you see any other common uses for trusts?
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:40.880]   Right.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.960]   So just like Ryan mentioned, avoiding probate
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.800]   is a very common and important reason to set up a trust.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.160]   There's also just anybody who wants
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.680]   to exert some sort of control over their assets
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.040]   after their death.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.800]   For instance, if they're leaving assets
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.680]   to a child who they don't--
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.280]   for one reason or another, they think
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.400]   the child would not make great decisions
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.560]   with regard to those assets.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.680]   It could be because the child is disabled,
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.640]   or it could just be because the child has a history of making
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.360]   poor financial decisions.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.040]   And so then you would set up a trust with a trustee.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.160]   The trustee could be another trusted family member,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.640]   or it could be a CPA or an attorney, somebody like that,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.800]   who would then be managing those assets for the benefit
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.960]   of the beneficiary.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.880]   But Mike, one of the advantages or disadvantages
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.680]   of an irrevocable trust is when you put assets
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.880]   into an irrevocable trust, you no longer
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.600]   get stepped up basis on death.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.720]   Could you talk about this from a tax standpoint,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.360]   the difference between using a revocable trust
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.120]   and an irrevocable trust?
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.680]   When we're talking about just normal assets held
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.080]   in a taxable brokerage account, when you die,
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.440]   the person who inherits them gets a step up
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.800]   in cost basis, which means their cost basis will
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.000]   be equal to whatever the market value is on the date
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.560]   that you die.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.760]   So they could sell those assets right away
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.120]   and not have to pay any capital gains tax.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.600]   Whereas in some cases here with an irrevocable trust,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.240]   there wouldn't be a step up in cost basis.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.600]   And so that's going to create some additional cost.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.160]   If they sell the assets, there's going
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.600]   to be some capital gains.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.080]   What is the cost basis?
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.960]   Let's say that I owned a lot of stock
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.600]   and I put it into an irrevocable trust, a generation
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.160]   skipping trust for the benefit of my grandchildren.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.760]   And the cost basis I had on that stock was $100,000,
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.520]   but now it's worth a million dollars.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.600]   Yeah, it's just carry over cost basis.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.480]   So their cost basis to my grandchildren
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.280]   would be $100,000.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:50.800]   Right.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.160]   It could be more as if the trust is reinvesting dividends
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.120]   and acquiring more shares at higher prices as time goes on.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.600]   There's going to be no step up.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.520]   So although you get the money out of, say,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.560]   my estate for the benefit of creditor protection
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.960]   and also for the benefit of potentially estate taxes,
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.440]   what I lose in this transaction is I lose,
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.840]   or they lose, the step up basis on death.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.640]   Yeah, there's trade-offs involved, certainly.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.640]   Also there's just the fact about revocable versus irrevocable.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.080]   There's the flexibility.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.440]   You lose the ability to make changes down the line.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.600]   And so there's trade-offs going on here, definitely.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.320]   Does everybody need a trust?
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.760]   And the reason I ask that is because a lot of people
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.680]   have beneficiaries on their IRAs and 401(k)s and Roth
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.080]   accounts, 403(b)s, whatever.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.920]   They also now, in their personal account,
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.600]   have what's called transfer on death, TOD.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.240]   So those assets go directly to somebody else.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.040]   And let's say they didn't own a house.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.120]   Let's say they were living in an apartment.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.280]   It seems like you wouldn't need a trust.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.960]   Yeah, myself as an example, I do not
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.760]   have a trust for that exact reason.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.080]   More than 90% of our total net worth
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.720]   is retirement accounts that will just pass automatically
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.040]   by designated beneficiary.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.400]   No, I don't think everybody needs a trust.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.960]   Ryan might have a different opinion.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.520]   I don't know.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.720]   We'll see.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.800]   No, I would agree with that.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.440]   Estate plans vary in complexity depending
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.840]   on how complex your estate is and where you want it to go.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.280]   I mean, if you have a spouse and you have accounts
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.440]   of beneficiaries, everything's already kind of accounted for.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.840]   It's just really the more complex your estate gets
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.560]   and the more detailed you want that distribution to be
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.280]   at your death, the trust will give you that control.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.800]   But yeah, there are definitely a lot
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.080]   of people that don't need a trust at all.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.880]   There are a few states that are what
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.320]   are called community property states.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.240]   And the rest of the states are called--
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.840]   I think it's spousal states.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.720]   Is that correct terminology?
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.120]   Yeah, spousal property or just common law.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.320]   Common law.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.600]   Separate property, yeah.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.120]   They're all kind of the same.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.160]   But there's very few-- there's, I think, like six states that
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.520]   are common community properties.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.520]   I think there are seven, because I live in one.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.560]   Seven.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.440]   But some of the big states, like Texas and Arizona
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.480]   and California, so even though there's only seven states,
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.560]   it's a pretty good-sized part of the population that falls
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.360]   under community property.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.480]   So could you explain what happens in a community property
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.240]   state versus a common law state?
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.480]   Sure, well, in a community property state, what it says
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.960]   is essentially any assets that are acquired,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.960]   any money that's earned during the marriage
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.200]   is community property.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.840]   So if there's unequal earning capacity or earnings
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.480]   from the wife and the husband, regardless,
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.080]   all those earnings are shared equally.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.920]   So the wife would own 50%.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.480]   The husband would own 50%.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.360]   And then on death, you can only transfer, obviously,
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.800]   that property that you own.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.560]   So if whatever assets are in that community property,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.480]   you can only transfer half of them.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.080]   Same goes with property.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.640]   If there's a home that's acquired during the marriage,
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.960]   even if only one spouse is on the title,
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.920]   that property is still community property,
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.400]   and each spouse owns half.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.240]   In common law property, the difference
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.440]   between community property and a separate property state
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.280]   is just how it determines what you own.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.280]   So in a community property state,
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.080]   if you own half of that property,
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   you can only transfer half of that property.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.600]   And if it was a separate property state
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.120]   and you were the only name on the title,
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.840]   then you can transfer the entire property.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.720]   - Okay, I'm a little confused.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.280]   - In a community property state,
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.080]   if you've got spouse A and spouse B,
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.280]   and there's a pool of community property,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.920]   essentially it's treated as if spouse A
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.960]   already owns half of the property
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.680]   and spouse B already owns half of the property.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   So if spouse A dies, spouse A's will
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.320]   doesn't have anything to do with what happens
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.400]   with spouse B's 50%.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.640]   Spouse B's 50% is still spouse B's 50%,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.880]   but spouse A's will can determine
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.440]   where spouse A's 50% goes.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.360]   And of course, in many cases it would be left to spouse B,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.560]   and now spouse B would have 100%,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.240]   but it could be left to somebody else.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.120]   - Give me another example of common law.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.120]   - Sure, so then we have to talk about
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.440]   other ways that property can be owned jointly.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.840]   The most common would be joint tenants
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.000]   with rights of survivorship.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.840]   And basically when property is owned that way
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.080]   by two owners, then when spouse,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.760]   or when joint owner A dies,
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.200]   it automatically goes to joint owner B.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.960]   But there's other versions as well.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.240]   So you can have tenancy in common,
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.880]   where if spouse A, or if two people own property this way,
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.160]   then in that case, when one person dies,
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.040]   their will controls what happens
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.720]   to their share of the property.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.320]   So they could leave their share of the property
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.280]   to their kids, as opposed to it automatically
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.080]   going to the other joint owner.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.520]   So it depends how the property is owned,
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.840]   basically how it's titled.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.520]   - So obviously titling of property
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.320]   is something you certainly wanna discuss
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.560]   with your estate planning attorney,
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.800]   depending on which state you're in.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   Let me ask about cost basis in a community property state.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:43.160]   If it's both jointly owned and one person dies,
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.480]   does it get a step up on death?
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.440]   - Yeah, in community property states,
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.080]   the surviving spouse gets a full step up,
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   which is an advantage relative to common law states.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.000]   So in other states, what happens is
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.400]   the surviving spouse would get a half step up, basically.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.120]   So if property was purchased for $300,000
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.800]   and its current market value is 500,000
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.920]   at the time of death,
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.280]   they would get their basis stepped up halfway.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.120]   So it'd be stepped up to 400,000 in a common law state,
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.480]   whereas a community property,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.560]   the surviving spouse gets a full step up.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.920]   So that's an advantage in those states.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.080]   - So I live in Texas, which is a community property state.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.480]   And I understand that here, when I die,
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.480]   all of my assets, my home, mutual funds,
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.280]   all get stepped up when I die fully, 100%.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   The whole account, whether she's on the title or not.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.240]   And then when she dies, there is another step up as well.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.000]   So in community property states with a couple,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   there are two step ups during their lifetime,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.280]   which is different than common law state, correct?
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.520]   - Yeah, it would be two full step ups.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.760]   And that is different, exactly, yep.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.000]   - So we get a little bit of a federal tax advantage
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.480]   by living in a community property state.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.760]   Yeah, which is kind of strange
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.200]   because we're talking about federal tax
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.400]   instead of state tax.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.880]   And so just because we live in community property states,
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   we get a federal tax break,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.080]   whereas common law states,
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.640]   couples don't get the same tax break.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.800]   So I find that interesting.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.640]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.280]   It is uncommon that the federal tax treatment
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.160]   varies from one state to another.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.640]   - All right, so we talked about probate a little bit,
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.520]   and this is a mystifying thing for a lot of people
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.560]   who have never been through it.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.640]   Ryan, you said in California it can take a long time
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.440]   to get an estate through probate.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.840]   Can you talk us through what happens
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.920]   when an estate goes to probate?
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.880]   - Yeah, probate is essentially the court process
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.320]   for if there's a will, validating the will,
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.400]   determining what assets the deceased owned,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.280]   and then who those assets should go to,
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.720]   and ensuring that creditors are also taken care of.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.920]   So assets that avoid probate,
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.800]   beneficiary designations or trust property,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.680]   they're not even discussed or considered
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.000]   in that probate proceeding.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.240]   - So in a sense, you're saying that
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.400]   because they avoid probate,
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.920]   they can be taken care of right away.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.480]   They don't have to go through the court system.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.320]   - Correct, yeah.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.840]   - If a house was owned in the name of a trust,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.720]   the beneficiaries or the heirs to that house
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.640]   can sell it right away.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.840]   They don't have to wait until it goes through probate,
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.680]   correct?
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.280]   - If the real estate is titled in the trust, yeah,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.240]   then it would avoid probate.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.200]   - Isn't that a big thing?
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.040]   I mean, look, I see a lot of houses
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.080]   as you drive down the road that are empty.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.720]   And I'm beginning to realize that a lot of those homes
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.200]   are from people who passed away
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.520]   and they can't do anything with them.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.040]   The family can't do anything with it
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.720]   because the real estate of the house
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   for the last surviving parent was not in a trust.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.960]   There may have been a will, maybe not,
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.680]   but the house is just sitting there empty
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.520]   and you can't do anything about it
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.080]   until the probate is done.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.320]   Am I correct on that?
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.640]   - Yeah, that's correct.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.240]   The title of the house is in limbo
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.120]   until the court decides who gets it
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.600]   or how it's to be distributed.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.560]   That's one of the most frustrating things about probate
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.120]   is until that probate process is complete,
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.560]   until the estate is closed, it's all kind of up in the air.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.920]   - I can imagine during COVID,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.680]   this thing just slowed down to a trickle,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.600]   getting things through probate court.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.280]   - Yeah, courts all over the country
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   came to a screeching halt, essentially.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.960]   I mean, anytime something required
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.640]   an in-person court appearance, it just didn't happen.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.800]   Everything's still kind of backed up,
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.320]   especially in California.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.520]   It's gonna take a long time
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.280]   before they catch up for certain.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.720]   California, I know that technically on paper,
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.080]   it shouldn't take more than a year,
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.520]   but it can take two, three, sometimes even more years
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.160]   before that estate is closed
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.760]   and the probate process is complete.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.080]   You were mentioning houses sort of unoccupied
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.360]   and them being in probate.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.000]   And that's true in a lot of situations.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.280]   Selling the property or transferring ownership,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.480]   none of that can happen until the estate's closed
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.280]   and probate is completed.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.160]   - So clearly, having the least amount of assets
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.120]   when you die go through probate is a good idea
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.160]   with either beneficiaries or transfer on debt.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:42.160]   Trust something where it doesn't have to go through a probate
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.720]   would be a beneficial thing for most people
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.160]   who are listening to this podcast.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.000]   - Yeah, that's correct.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.320]   I mean, there's an argument to be made
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.160]   for the probate process.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.760]   If you think there's gonna be fighting
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.120]   over the validity of a will or anything like that,
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.640]   you want the court to be involved
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.200]   and have some level of control over things.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.920]   But generally, yeah, you want to avoid probate
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.520]   as much as possible.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.120]   - So we've talked about needing a will,
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.200]   power of attorney, durable power of attorney.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.600]   We need a medical power of attorney,
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.640]   guardianship papers, perhaps a trust,
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.200]   depending on your situation and doing these documents.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.440]   And go to Mike on this because I don't want
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.680]   a biased opinion by an attorney who does documents.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.720]   I mean, why can't we just go to LegalZoom
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.600]   or something online and create these documents, Mike?
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.160]   I mean, do we need to hire an attorney?
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.880]   Nothing against you, Ryan, I'm just asking Mike.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.240]   - No offense taken.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.760]   No, so I am interested in Ryan's opinion here also.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.680]   I'll say that from my point of view is in some cases,
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.040]   yeah, go ahead and do LegalZoom.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.360]   If you have a very simple situation,
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.200]   although the caveat here is that in the field of taxation,
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.360]   we have a joke that everyone thinks
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.960]   that their situation is simple
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.160]   because they don't understand all the complexities
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.040]   that are actually bundled in there.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.280]   So there are some times where LegalZoom is gonna be fine.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.800]   The less amount of assets in question,
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.920]   the less complicated they are.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.800]   Not having kids, for instance,
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.960]   would be another thing that makes things simpler
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.400]   or not having minor children anyway.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.120]   There are some cases where, sure,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.160]   go ahead and go through LegalZoom,
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.080]   especially if the alternative is that you wouldn't,
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.320]   you wouldn't talk to an attorney.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.200]   If you just know that the alternative
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.400]   would be no will at all, then okay,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   something like LegalZoom.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.720]   An attorney, I mean, the main point
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.080]   isn't that they're going to, you know,
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.760]   write up these documents for you.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   It's that they're going to give you advice
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.240]   about what should be included in these documents.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.600]   That's, it's valuable.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   And it's valuable in ways that people often don't anticipate.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.520]   - What do you think, Ryan?
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.920]   I mean, unbiased opinion.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.200]   - Unbiased opinion?
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.000]   Like Mike said, there might be an instance
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.520]   where LegalZoom makes sense for those circumstances
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.600]   where one, your estate is relatively simple
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.360]   and your estate plan should be relatively simple.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.880]   You'd also have to be like a do-it-yourselfer,
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.960]   if you're pretty confident you can figure out
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.080]   most things on your own and you do a lot of research.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.960]   And personally, I think the law is at times accessible.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.160]   So if you think that you can figure that out,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.280]   again, like Mike said, one of the bigger advantages
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.480]   is a lawyer will present options to you
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.320]   that you didn't really know.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.440]   One other thing to consider
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.480]   is the cost of making a mistake.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.080]   You know, like if you look at LegalZoom,
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.800]   I'd imagine it's probably a couple hundred dollars
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.720]   for a will, couple hundred more for a trust.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.040]   I mean, for a basic estate plan with an attorney,
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.120]   you can get will, trust, power of attorney,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.160]   all that stuff for 24, $2,500.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.200]   The cost of making a mistake,
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.160]   if something does go through probate,
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.640]   that it wouldn't otherwise.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.000]   I mean, the probate process itself
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.960]   is gonna cost the very minimum $2,000.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.520]   And then based on the size of the estate,
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.720]   it's gonna go up from there.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.360]   So it's usually pretty good insurance
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.720]   to go with an attorney.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   - So let's say I was living in Texas and I moved to Utah.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:17.320]   Do I need to get all my estate documents redone in Utah?
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.720]   - No, you don't need to.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.240]   If a will or a trust is validly created in one state,
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.880]   then it's gonna be upheld in the other state.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.120]   So the state in which it's formed or created,
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   that determines the validity of it
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.440]   as far as the administration of it.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.880]   That's gonna be determined by the state
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.080]   where you reside at the time of death.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.280]   There are some reasons to move your estate
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.680]   to another state when you move for tax reasons.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.160]   Mike probably has more knowledge on that subject.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.000]   - What do you think, Mike?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.520]   Are there tax reasons to go visit an attorney
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.600]   in the new state where you now live?
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.720]   - Yeah, there can be.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.320]   One big thing, the federal estate tax
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.200]   has a super high exclusion amount right now,
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.800]   a little over $12 million.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.480]   So obviously, the number of people impacted
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.360]   by that is very small.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.920]   - And that's per person, by the way.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.440]   That's not per couple.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.880]   - Right, exactly, yeah.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.600]   - And if one person dies,
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.280]   the other person gets 24, correct?
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.280]   - Yeah, the surviving spouse can,
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.800]   we have what we call portability now.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.840]   So any unused exclusion amount can be carried over,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.920]   basically, to that surviving spouse.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.440]   - Okay, so go on with the state.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.400]   Sorry about that.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.240]   - No, you're good.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.400]   So at the state level,
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.720]   many states don't impose an estate tax, but some do.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.480]   And of the states that do,
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.640]   in many cases, that exclusion amount
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.320]   is a much lower threshold, $1 million, for instance.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.480]   And when you're dealing with that $1 million threshold,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.400]   obviously, that means that a lot more people
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.640]   are going to be impacted.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.360]   People whose estates exceed $1 million
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.880]   are close to hitting 12 million, right?
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.520]   So, and not only that, but in some cases,
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.080]   there isn't this portability that we talk about
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.200]   between spouses at the state level.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.480]   And so you can use certain types of trusts, for instance,
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.560]   to essentially artificially create that portability.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.040]   So without getting into the details,
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.360]   yes, that would be a reason, certainly,
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.040]   to talk to an attorney in the new state
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.200]   so they can help you work through those issues.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.040]   - I understand.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.080]   Okay, well, thank you for that.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.640]   Let's get to the second half of this,
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:33.360]   which is Mike's book, "After the Death of Your Spouse,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.240]   Next Financial Steps for a Surviving Spouse."
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.520]   Great book.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.480]   Talks about the immediate steps,
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.520]   and then it talks about intermediate steps.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.280]   I'm gonna let Mike go ahead and take over from here.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.480]   And then what should somebody do?
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.040]   What's the first thing they should do?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.240]   - Well, generally, the first thing
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   in this long list of administrative things to be done
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.920]   is getting certified copies of the death certificate.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:06.760]   And that's because there are a ton of different entities
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.080]   that you're going to interact with over the next months
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.960]   that will need a copy of that.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.280]   And sometimes if you're visiting them in person,
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.640]   they'll be happy to let you show it to them,
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.200]   and then maybe they'll scan it or make a copy,
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.440]   and then you can keep it.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.560]   But sometimes they want to keep a certified copy
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.920]   of the death certificate, so you'll need several copies.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.240]   - How many is several?
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.120]   I mean, 20, 30?
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.880]   - Yeah, 20 to 30 is what I often hear recommended,
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.480]   but it's going to depend.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.160]   Basically, the more accounts,
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.480]   the greater the number of accounts
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.560]   that the deceased person owned,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.960]   then the more financial institutions
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.760]   that you'll be interacting with.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.280]   And so the more copies you're going to need.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.240]   So basically, the more complex the person's life,
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.160]   the more copies you're likely to need.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.040]   - Sure speaks to simplicity,
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.120]   which is what we talk about on the Bogleheads all the time.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.200]   Listen, I'm a veteran.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.440]   You know, I retired from the Marine Corps after 21 years,
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.120]   and I understand that I may be able
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.400]   to get free death certificates.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.320]   What are the advantages and disadvantages of that?
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.920]   - Yeah, well, disadvantages, none, really.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.760]   It's free.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.160]   - Well, how long will it take?
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.080]   - Yeah, well, so there's a few ways
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.520]   you can get death certificates.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.160]   Number one is whatever business
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.840]   is handling the deceased person's remains.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.760]   So the funeral home or the cremation company,
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.200]   they will usually arrange to have
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.560]   however many you ask sent to you,
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.600]   and there's going to be a per copy fee for that.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.520]   You can also request them from your state
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.240]   or from your county.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.320]   In many cases, requesting them from your state
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.160]   is less expensive, but it does take longer.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.200]   Of course, how long it takes and how much it costs
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.920]   varies by state and by county.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.680]   Here in St. Louis, for instance,
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.960]   I think it's $11 per copy.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.600]   And just like you said, veterans,
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.200]   many states will provide some number of free copies
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.520]   of certified death certificates
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.560]   for surviving family members of a deceased veteran.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.760]   In Missouri, for instance, I believe it's three copies.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.120]   So you might as well request them,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.120]   but you're probably going to need more than that.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.840]   - Okay, so now we have the death certificates.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   We're ready to get going on contacting various people
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.080]   if they haven't already been contacted.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.880]   So what's the list?
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.440]   - The list, yeah.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.560]   It's a long list, unfortunately.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.080]   And I just want to back up a step
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.280]   and say that this is the reason why the book, by the way,
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.560]   is broken down into immediate next steps
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.520]   and intermediate next steps,
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.960]   is that there's a lot of things
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.160]   that you're going to have to do that are important,
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.240]   but they're not necessarily urgent.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:59.160]   And in some cases, you can't do them even.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.880]   In a lot of these cases, you can't do them
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.640]   until you have that death certificate in hand.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.600]   So for a lot of these things,
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.720]   yes, it's important to know
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.000]   that it's going to be on your to-do list,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.920]   but you don't have to tackle it right now.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.720]   And also in many cases,
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.000]   it's best to wait before making major decisions.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.480]   So for instance, if there's life insurance proceeds
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.320]   or a death benefit from a variable
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.080]   or any sort of annuity, for instance,
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.560]   you're going to have to decide
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.480]   how you want to invest that money,
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.360]   but you don't have to make that decision immediately.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   It's okay to just leave the money sitting around
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.800]   in cash for a little bit
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.040]   while you work through all these other things
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.960]   you need to get sorted out.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.800]   So just, it's important to understand
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   that not all of these things
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.200]   need to be tackled absolutely immediately.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.240]   Companies to contact,
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.440]   obviously one of the first ones
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.600]   would be just who we mentioned.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.640]   If there's a life insurance policy,
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.000]   contacting that insurance company,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.760]   giving them the certified copy
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.680]   of the death certificate and so on.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.400]   Also, many people have some level of life insurance
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.240]   through their employer.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.240]   So contacting the deceased person's employer
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.520]   to ask about that.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.040]   There's other information you're going to need
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.800]   to cover with the employer as well.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.960]   Generally, the employer will owe the estate
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.200]   some amount of unpaid wages, also unused vacation time.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.360]   And then you'll also want to talk to the employer about,
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.960]   is there an FSA or HSA linked to the employer
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.560]   that has some balance in there?
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.400]   You'll want to find out about that.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.280]   If your health insurance is currently
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.800]   through your deceased spouse's employer,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.160]   then it's super important to get the details there
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.000]   as far as how long does that coverage continue?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.360]   Exactly when is it going to terminate?
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.320]   Because obviously you have to start lining up
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.200]   your next source of health insurance.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.360]   Social Security Administration is important.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.840]   - I know you wrote a whole chapter in the book
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.920]   about how to deal with Social Security
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.920]   and what do you get and what do you don't get.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.360]   And there's even a death benefit apparently
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.640]   that you get from Social Security,
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.920]   which quite frankly, I didn't even know.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.200]   So life insurance, health insurance,
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.640]   your employer, Social Security, credit cards, loans.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.280]   Oh, by the way, when I die, all my loans go away, correct?
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.880]   I mean, all my credit card debt, right?
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.840]   - Unfortunately, not exactly, no.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.120]   - But I thought I wanted to die in debt.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.880]   I mean, you hear that all the time from people, right?
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.040]   - Well, in a lot of cases, if you have debt,
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.120]   there's somebody else who it's also their debt
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.600]   if you're married.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.800]   In many cases, your spouse is on that debt also,
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.480]   so it is their debt also.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.520]   But as a separate point, even if that's not the case,
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.960]   your estate still owes that debt.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.800]   And so creditors, if there's some credit card balance
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.160]   or a car loan or what have you,
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.800]   your estate still owes that debt.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.320]   - So I just wanna circle back a little bit to probate then.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.440]   So between husband and wife, let's say husband dies,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.240]   this still goes through probate
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.680]   because husband might have auto loan, for example,
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.440]   that it's in his name and he's paying on it.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.160]   So wife gets the car,
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.640]   but she still owes what the husband took out as a loan,
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.480]   correct?
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.280]   And this is all done through probate?
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.400]   - Yes, yes to both questions.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   Yes, it's done through probate,
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.240]   and yes, the wife would still owe the loan on the car.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.040]   - Okay, so life insurance, health insurance,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.480]   we'll get a little bit more to social security in a minute,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.760]   old employer, loans, credit cards,
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.120]   changing the name on bank accounts.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.920]   How about deeds?
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.680]   Mike, you talked about in your book,
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.280]   a personal representative,
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.720]   instead of somebody doing this themselves,
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.920]   they have a personal representative do it,
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.480]   or maybe a court appointed personal representative.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.120]   What is that all about?
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.840]   - Yeah, personal representative
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.440]   is more just a catch-all term.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.240]   You've probably heard the term executor before.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.520]   That's the person named in the will
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.840]   to handle the affairs of the estate.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.160]   If there is no will,
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.960]   or if there was nobody named as executor in the will,
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.000]   or if the person named as executor
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.640]   chooses not to be the executor,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.120]   because you don't have to be,
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.920]   then the court's going to appoint an administrator
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.400]   to handle the affairs of the estate.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.120]   And personal representative is basically
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.560]   just a catch-all term
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.560]   to describe executors and administrators.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.560]   It's basically just whoever is appointed by the court,
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.320]   ultimately, to handle the affairs of the estate
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.920]   is known as the personal representative.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.760]   So you can think of it
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.360]   as a synonym for executor, basically.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.920]   - And Ryan, in your experience,
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.960]   does the courts appoint a personal representative?
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.480]   Who are these people?
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.600]   - Personal representatives are usually the professionals
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.680]   that have done that before.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.000]   Sometimes the court will appoint a personal representative
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.440]   that is related to the estate
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.720]   in some way related to the decedent.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.200]   Court has a lot of discretion
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.800]   as to who to decide to handle that.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.840]   - And they get paid for this, these people?
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.200]   - Yes, they can get paid, yeah.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.800]   - So there's really no difference then
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.080]   between a personal representative
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.240]   and a trustee or an executor.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.320]   I mean, it's all the same, right?
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.160]   It's just the same,
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.600]   just different terminology for the same thing.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.480]   - So personal representative and executor,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.640]   you can think of those as synonyms,
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.080]   but there is an important distinction
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.320]   between those and trustee, right?
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.800]   Because the personal representative and the executor,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.480]   they were talking about the estate,
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.760]   the assets in the estate,
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.920]   whereas trustee is dealing with the assets in the trust.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.960]   - Very good.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.800]   Mike, in your book,
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.400]   you talk about an idea that I had never heard of before,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.520]   that is to open up a separate bank account for all of this
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.520]   and get a separate tax ID number for the deceased,
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.600]   the estate.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.240]   Can you talk about that?
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.440]   - Yeah, so in the year of death,
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.560]   the surviving spouse can file jointly
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.760]   with the deceased spouse for the year of death.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.680]   And so that income that's gonna be included on that return
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.600]   is all of the surviving spouse's income for the whole year.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.720]   And for the deceased spouse,
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.560]   it's all of their income up until the day that they died.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:19.160]   Any income after that is the estate's income.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.400]   And that has to be reported
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.600]   on the estate's income tax return,
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.080]   which is a separate return that has to be filed.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.520]   - I'm married and I died.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.200]   And so wouldn't we just file a joint return that year?
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.040]   - Right, exactly.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.240]   You do file a joint return that year, most likely.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.800]   I mean, you don't have to, just like any other year,
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.880]   your surviving spouse could choose to file separately,
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.640]   but probably she would choose to file jointly.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.920]   And so that joint return that she would file
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.040]   would include all of her income that year
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.600]   and all of your income up until the date of death.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.920]   But any income that would be your income,
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.840]   let's say it occurs a month after you die,
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.480]   and let's say it would be your income,
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.200]   except you are now deceased,
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.920]   that income is the estate's income.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.560]   And the estate is a separate legal entity.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.120]   And so that income, the estate's income,
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.560]   needs to be reported separately.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.280]   And so having a separate bank account,
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.240]   separate tax ID number is really the way you wanna do it.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.080]   - Okay.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.840]   - Having everything going into one account
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.840]   and being intermingled, it's gonna be,
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.160]   at least from a tax perspective, it's gonna be a mess.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.280]   I assume it's likely, at least potentially,
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.320]   gonna cause some problems
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.720]   with regard to other legal topics.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.320]   From a tax perspective, it's definitely gonna be simpler
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.400]   to have the estate have a separate bank account.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.120]   - Is that estate tax form a 1041?
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.760]   Is that what that's called?
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.960]   - It's 1041, right?
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.680]   And that's the estate income tax return,
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.840]   which is separate from the return that you would file
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.200]   with regard to estate taxes.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.520]   - Right, that's a different tax form
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.520]   and a different form for the joint income tax return.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.720]   So three tax returns.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.800]   I tell you what, I thought this was gonna be an easy podcast
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.840]   but the more we talk, this is not easy.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.280]   - Yeah, that's exactly the point of the book.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.800]   There's so much, so many different things you need to do.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.920]   And if you haven't been through it before, all of it's new.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.000]   - Let's get into things like selling the house.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.760]   One spouse dies, the other spouse is still in the house,
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.000]   house is too big, spouse wants to sell the house.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.600]   Normally, if it's after the year after the spouse died,
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.880]   that would be a single tax return.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.760]   So you would think that the free capital gain
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.840]   on that would be 250,000, but it's actually not.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.880]   There's an exception.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.440]   So Mike, this is a tax question,
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.040]   so I'm gonna go back to you.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.800]   To back up a step, generally, when you sell your home,
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.320]   if you sell it at a gain,
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.440]   you can exclude up to $250,000 of the capital gain
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.080]   if you lived in the home for at least two years
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.120]   out of the last five years and you owned the home
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.920]   for at least two years out of the last five years
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.320]   and you didn't use this exclusion for the last two years.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.520]   So if you meet those three requirements,
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.520]   you can exclude up to $250,000 of gain.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.040]   And if you're married, it would be 500,000.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.760]   Instead of 250,000.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.800]   So to Rick's question, the idea here is that,
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.000]   okay, well, in the following year,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.120]   this person is no longer filing as married.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   So you would think it would be a $250,000 exclusion,
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.720]   but there's a special rule that allows you
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.840]   to get the $500,000 exclusion.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.720]   If you sell the home specifically
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.400]   within two years of the date of death,
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.120]   and it's important to note that it's two years
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.320]   of the date of death rather than two calendar years,
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.240]   for instance, and you haven't remarried
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.080]   by the time that you sell the home
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.120]   and the normal requirement where you haven't used
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.800]   this exclusion for the two years prior,
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.040]   neither you nor the deceased spouse used this exclusion
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.080]   during that two-year period,
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.280]   then you can use the $500,000 basically married couple
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.880]   exclusion amount rather than the 250,000.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.160]   - But aside from that, are there any others like that,
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.000]   any benefits to surviving spouses
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.920]   or basically the year after the death of a spouse,
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.920]   the surviving spouse has to file as a single taxpayer
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.680]   with all lower income thresholds
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.400]   and IRMA thresholds and everything else?
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.720]   - In many cases, yes, the surviving spouse
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.640]   will now just be a regular single unmarried filer.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.760]   However, there's also the qualifying
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.120]   surviving spouse filing status,
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   used to be known as qualifying widower filing status.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.800]   But to qualify for that,
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.520]   you need to have a minor child basically,
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.440]   or a disabled child who lives with you
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.320]   and you pay their costs of living and so on.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.120]   That filing status works extends for another two years
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.800]   after the year of death.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.680]   - Brian, you've been listening to all the information
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.160]   that we've been talking about that's in Mike's book.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.720]   Would you like to add anything to what you should do
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.640]   as soon as a spouse dies?
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.600]   - Number one thing would be figure out
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.240]   if they had an estate plan in place.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.080]   Usually, you're their spouse,
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   you do know and you know where those documents are,
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.560]   but step one would be locate them
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.840]   and make sure things go off in the right direction.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.240]   - Good point, know where those documents are.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   Okay, now we're gonna get into the social security question.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.000]   But Mike, without getting too deep,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.280]   because this can get very, very deep.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.880]   What happens to social security when one spouse passes?
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.880]   - Yeah, so there's three primary types of benefits
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.840]   to be thinking about.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.320]   There's also, I guess I'll say a fourth one
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.120]   that we'll cover real quick,
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.280]   which is there's a lump sum death benefit.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.560]   It's just the flat $255 that you get one time,
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.800]   so it's not a big deal, but you will get that amount.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.280]   Other than that, there's three primary types of benefits
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.880]   to be concerned with.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.800]   The first is child benefits.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.720]   And so that is for,
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:10.280]   if you have a child who is under 18 or under 19
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.920]   and they're a full-time high school student,
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.200]   or they are disabled with a disability
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.640]   that began before age 22,
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.680]   then that child can receive benefits
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.960]   on your deceased spouse's work record.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.800]   And that's just called a child benefit.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:30.560]   So you'll usually wanna file for that as soon as you can.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.640]   And then there's also a similar benefit.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.160]   It's the same benefit amount.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.400]   It's called a mother/father benefit.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.680]   And that is if you have a child in care who is under 16.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.640]   So this one cuts off at an earlier age.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.800]   So under 16 or disabled,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.480]   then you would get a benefit as well.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.320]   So your child gets a child benefit
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.920]   and you get this mother/father benefit.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.240]   So those are if there are minor children.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.880]   Then the third type of benefit to be concerned with
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.280]   is a surviving spouse benefit,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.120]   sometimes referred to as a widow or widower benefit.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:11.640]   And for that one, it can start as early as age 60
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.240]   or age 50 if you're disabled.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.920]   And the super important thing to know
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.760]   about surviving spouse benefits
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.040]   is that you can file for that benefit at age 60
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.400]   and that doesn't automatically force you
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.240]   to have filed for your retirement benefit,
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.960]   which means that you can file for your survivor benefit
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.680]   at age 60 and let your retirement benefit keep growing.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.360]   - By retirement benefit, you mean my own work.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.600]   I'm working still.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.720]   So I can get a social security benefit
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.880]   based on my spouse dying when I hit 60,
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.800]   but it doesn't affect my social security benefit
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.240]   if I'm still working.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.600]   - You don't have to still be working,
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   but right, it doesn't affect the retirement benefit
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.120]   based on your own work record.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:49:59.960]   - Okay.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.160]   - So you can let your own retirement benefit
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.240]   based on your work record,
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.400]   allow that to keep growing till age 70.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:09.080]   So you basically get to collect this surviving spouse benefit
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.040]   from 60 until 70,
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.960]   and then file for your retirement benefit at 70.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.360]   Or you can do the opposite.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.400]   Basically, you can file for your retirement benefit
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.680]   as early as you can at 62
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.440]   and let your surviving spouse benefit grow
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.040]   until it maxes out and that maxes out
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.480]   at your full retirement age.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.960]   So you can collect your retirement benefit
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.120]   from basically 62 to 67,
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.000]   or it could be 66 in 10 months or something like that.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.320]   But so the general idea is you file
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.040]   for whichever of these two benefits is smaller,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.400]   file for that one immediately,
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.160]   as early as you can pretty much,
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   and then let the other benefit continue growing
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.280]   until it maxes out either at your full retirement age
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.520]   or at age 70.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.480]   - And where will people be able
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.040]   to get information about this?
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.360]   - Sure, so the book covers all of these topics
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.760]   after the death of your spouse.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.520]   My book, "Social Security Made Simple," also covers it.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.200]   Social Security Administration website is great, frankly.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:07.000]   It's important to understand with any social security topic,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.600]   just like with any tax topic,
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.120]   that if you're just looking at a, quote,
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.480]   plain English page on the SSA website,
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.920]   like an FAQ page or something like that,
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.080]   they're doing their best to explain it in plain English,
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.400]   but that doesn't mean that this is precisely
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.920]   what the law says, right?
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.280]   There can be exceptions that aren't mentioned on that page,
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.560]   or maybe they're giving you,
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.920]   "This is mostly how it works," sort of explanation.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.880]   So that happens sometimes.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.480]   It's important to understand that on those sorts of pages
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.800]   on the SSA website, it's a very credible source,
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.360]   but it might not be precisely exactly how the math
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.840]   is actually going to work in the real life situation.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.080]   - So the last question, and this'll be for both of you,
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.560]   and I'm gonna chime in on this
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.760]   because I'm actually involved in this part.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.000]   You know, one person is doing all the investing
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.920]   and they're the financial person in the relationship,
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.000]   and they die.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   Should the other person go out and hire a financial advisor
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.400]   to help them with their, all of this,
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.880]   all of the investment side of things,
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.720]   now that they've had this portfolio dumped in their lap?
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.600]   What do you think, Ryan?
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.480]   I mean, from your perspective,
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.680]   what have you seen?
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.080]   - Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.280]   Mike just discussed, I mean, there's so many situations
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.760]   where not necessarily in the immediate,
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.000]   but financial decisions do need to be made
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.720]   that sort of impact investments,
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.680]   and if you're not prepared to make those decisions yourself,
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.200]   then you should definitely hire a professional,
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.840]   just as you would before the death of your spouse.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.520]   - What do you think, Mike?
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.320]   - Yeah, similar answer where,
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.960]   just like you would before the death of your spouse.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.120]   So if you're in a situation where you don't feel
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.600]   like you're qualified to make this decision on your own,
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.200]   getting guidance is helpful.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.800]   Now, of course, the answer to that question
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.360]   might be different than it was
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.520]   while your spouse was still living,
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.920]   'cause perhaps the two of you collectively were qualified,
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.600]   but now you don't feel qualified on your own.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.840]   I will also note that it's not something
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.200]   you want to rush, usually.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.520]   Again, just 'cause you have some life insurance proceeds
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.080]   that came in doesn't mean you need to get it invested
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.000]   within the next month.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.840]   You're gonna potentially miss out on some returns,
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.600]   and that's okay.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.160]   It's not a big, or it is a big decision,
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.880]   and therefore you do not want to rush it.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:28.880]   Also, just like with when you retire and you have an IRA
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:32.480]   that you are considering rolling over to a 401(k),
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.200]   that makes you a target for certain financial advisors
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.280]   who just want to collect a commission as that money moves.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.560]   It's the same thing here.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.760]   If you're in a transition period,
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.120]   that can make you a target for certain people
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.640]   who want to collect a commission.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.040]   Now that suddenly there's some money
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.800]   that either life insurance proceeds
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.720]   or death benefit from an annuity,
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.560]   or simply the portfolio that your spouse
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:59.120]   had been taken care of, and now you're taking care of it,
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.080]   there might be, well, not there might be,
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.360]   there are people who are going to want to try
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.280]   to earn a commission off of that.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.520]   And so it's important to be careful
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.240]   with regard to who you hire.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.320]   - I'll just add my two cents here.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.880]   I've been doing this investment advising for 35 years,
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.600]   and 25 of those have been basically on my own
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.520]   with my own company.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:26.520]   And people have said to me, "Rick, my husband or my wife,
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:32.440]   "I've left instructions for him or her to call you
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.000]   "if something happens to me.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.680]   "I'm going to be self-managing my own portfolio."
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   And then they do, and they do a good job.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:43.920]   But if something happens to be my husband, wife,
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.040]   is going to call you.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:51.040]   In 25 years, I have never received one of those calls, ever.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.840]   And why is that?
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:57.840]   Because the spouse doesn't know me.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.640]   They haven't talked with me or been involved with me, ever.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:05.720]   I don't think it's because nobody has died.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.720]   I'm pretty sure people have died.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.720]   But the spouses are not going to take that instruction.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:14.320]   Someone else is going to get in front of them first.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.400]   And it's not going to go the way you want.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.440]   So if there's going to be an advisor relationship,
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.440]   if that's what you want your spouse to do,
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.440]   that you need to establish that relationship together first
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:34.640]   so that he or she knows this person.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.200]   And then there's a higher probability
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.800]   things will happen the way that
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.280]   you would like them to happen.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.920]   - So with that, any closing comments, Ryan?
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.520]   You have any final thoughts?
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.880]   - Yeah, I guess everyone should consider
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.680]   having an estate plan.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.560]   I guess, like we discussed, not everyone needs one.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.640]   But I think everyone should at least
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.480]   consult an attorney and figure out if they do
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.600]   and what the advantages of having one are.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.560]   Myself included, there are a lot of attorneys
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:09.200]   that don't charge for a consultation.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.280]   So if you're not in Utah, you're not in California,
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.680]   find one that does and talk to them
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.720]   and see how you might protect yourself and your loved ones.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.200]   - Mike, what do you have to say?
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.120]   - Estate planning, so I don't personally do estate planning
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.600]   as I'm not an attorney.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.400]   It's an area that falls under
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.120]   the broader area of financial planning.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:34.240]   And I think it is possibly the neatest part
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:39.120]   of financial planning because it's by definition selfless.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.680]   You're taking care of people who you care about.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.600]   And a lot of times people don't wanna do it
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.720]   'cause oh gosh, you have to, I mean,
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.120]   you're thinking about unhappy things.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.000]   You're thinking about what happens
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.200]   if you become incapacitated or if you die.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.920]   But it's all about taking care of the people
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.640]   who you care about, the people you love.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.160]   And it's important to take some time to do it.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.760]   It's an important part of financial planning,
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.880]   even though it's this unhappy topic
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.960]   that you have to think about.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.920]   But people feel better after doing it.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:12.800]   And it really does take care of the people who you love.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.440]   - Well, that's a great way to end.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.840]   Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.840]   I think I have more questions now
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.240]   than I had when I first started the podcast.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:26.240]   But thank you so much for joining us, Ryan and Mike.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.680]   I appreciate very much all your insights.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.600]   - Thanks, Rick.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.560]   - Thank you, Rick.
