[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.380]   You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs, where we give you practical insights into jobs and
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.380]   careers.
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.960]   I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking about how to be a market researcher.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.120]   Market research, in my opinion, is a field that often flies under the radar, but is critical
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.680]   to any company in any industry.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.960]   In high tech, there's a lot of emphasis put on product management, demand generation,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.120]   business operations, engineering, but you rarely hear about market research.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.880]   It kind of reminds me of the iPhone.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.120]   So back in the day, I owned this indestructible little brick called Nokia.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.400]   These cell phones were all the rage, and it came with all these cool interchangeable covers
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.460]   and accessories.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.880]   But work started to require more access to email, and then Blackberry became the next
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.400]   big thing.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.400]   So when the iPhone first came out, I looked at it as pure luxury.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.320]   Until I got one.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.460]   Then like everyone else, I never looked back, and I can't imagine life without one.
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.100]   So to me, market research is like that.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.800]   With it, you can identify market trends, you can gain insight on your competitors, and
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.920]   you can hear directly from your customers about what they actually want by testing new
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.680]   products and services.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.920]   So if you've ever considered a career in market research, then this episode is for
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.920]   you.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.400]   Today, we're going to sit down with Tony Tong.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.960]   He's a senior market research manager at LinkedIn.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.400]   Not only are you going to get a day in the life of a market researcher, but you're going
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.680]   to get some practical insights on several topics, including when to use primary, secondary,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.240]   qualitative, and quantitative research, how insights influence the major product decisions
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.560]   at LinkedIn, and how to start a new career as a market researcher.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.720]   All right, let's get started.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.800]   Today, we're talking about market research, and joining us is Tony Tong.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.240]   Tony, how are you doing?
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.240]   I'm doing awesome.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.240]   Thanks, Tim.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.800]   Tony, I don't want to make you nervous.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.680]   I've actually truly been looking forward to this conversation because I'm a huge fan of
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680]   market research.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.280]   You know, like companies, we always say that we strive to be customer centric, we put our
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   customers first.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.680]   We don't really know if you're succeeding in that if you don't hear the voice of the
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.680]   customer.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.040]   And that's kind of where someone like you in market research comes in.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.640]   So can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing for market research, how long
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.320]   you've been doing it, and then how it relates to LinkedIn?
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.000]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.840]   So I kind of cringe at this question a little bit because it makes me realize how long I've
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   been doing this.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.800]   But it has been, as the kids like to say, it's been a minute.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.120]   I've been in market research almost three decades now.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.560]   So I started on the agency side, then I worked at Visa for a number of years, and then at
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.240]   Logitech for a short stint, and then currently, I'm at LinkedIn where I've been for the last
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.320]   nine years.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.900]   So yeah, that's a quick journey.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.200]   We're seasoned vets, as we say, right?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   That's right.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   Cool.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.720]   So can you help us understand and you can use maybe LinkedIn as an example, but like,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.120]   what is market research?
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.280]   You know, and what objectives or questions are you trying to solve?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000]   And then what are the common types of market research you do?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.080]   So very simply put, market research is essentially trying to understand what...
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.120]   So I'm going to use the word members because at LinkedIn, we talk about members, but yeah,
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.020]   if you are a company, you might talk about your customers or your consumers, whatnot.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.560]   But yeah, so at LinkedIn, basically, in terms of market research, we're trying to understand
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.680]   what our members, what their needs are, what their attitudes are towards certain things.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.200]   And that's really to help kind of inform two major areas.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.480]   One is like products that we build, and then two is like marketing, how we market to members.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.160]   And so in terms of market research, at the end of the day, what I'm trying to do is help
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.560]   LinkedIn understand like the needs of our members in terms of products and what that
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.960]   experience on LinkedIn is like, and what kind of tools resonate with them versus what tools
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.780]   that some engineer might want to create, but it's not really resonating with members.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:18.400]   And so we try to steer basically our products towards being products that are actually useful
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   for our members.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.080]   And so that's from a product standpoint.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.240]   From a marketing standpoint, I also support marketing.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.960]   Actually, my core stakeholders are typically PMMs, product marketing managers.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.720]   And so a big part of their job is just trying to understand how to best market to members,
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.040]   what kind of messages like resonate with members.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.580]   So I'll give you a very quick example.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.620]   One of the things right now that's new on LinkedIn is this whole idea of verification.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.960]   So LinkedIn, maybe like a lot of social media platforms, maybe less so than other social
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   media platforms.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.400]   But one of the things that LinkedIn struggles with is sometimes we have people who are not
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   who they claim to be.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.420]   And so this idea of verifying like who you are, the fact that you work at Netflix or
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:14.080]   you work at State Farm, what have you, basically verifying your employment as well as verifying
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.880]   who you are, that's an initiative that's going on right now at LinkedIn.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.560]   And so in terms of messaging, we're trying to figure out what is that core messaging
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.040]   or that positioning that really will help people sign up to verify that they are who
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   they say they are.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.520]   So two very high level examples, but yeah, so market research in essence is helping companies
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:47.080]   understand the needs, the desires, the attitudes of their members, their customers, their consumers.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.040]   Can you help us understand, maybe even through practical example, I'd love the example you
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.400]   just now used right now, verification.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.480]   You mentioned you have two stakeholders, one being marketing, one being product.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.520]   I assume each of those have their own priorities of things that they care about, right?
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.520]   So what does it look like to you, like when you're working with your stakeholders to look
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.640]   at maybe the roadmap of research they want to do, is it categorized by genres, by type?
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.600]   And then how do you then kind of prioritize which one you're going to do?
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.680]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.560]   So I think that kind of differs depending on the role someone has within market research.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.040]   So typically I would say what would happen is that on a quarterly basis, a market research
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.760]   manager would get together with people in product, with people in marketing, and for
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.400]   that upcoming quarter, basically talk about what are the core research needs that those
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.560]   teams have, and we'll call them the big rock.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.920]   So we'll work on those big studies that are usually more strategic questions.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.640]   But then within those big rocks, there's all sorts of like micro questions that usually
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.640]   come up.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.560]   And like that's actually a world that I play in pretty heavily.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.320]   And so for my role, specifically at LinkedIn, I manage what we call an insight community.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.800]   And the core goal of an insight community is to answer more, they tend to be more tactical
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   questions.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.560]   So yeah, so in addition to those core, you know, big rocks that we're tackling, we also,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.400]   you know, we're an internet company, it moves like really quickly, really quickly.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.540]   So a lot of times you don't have time to spin up like a huge study.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.240]   And so that's where having like a community at the ready to answer these types of questions
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.800]   is really useful.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.560]   And the program that I've managed, launched probably six, seven years ago now, and has
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.420]   grown each and every year, it's highly leveraged.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.840]   But yeah, earlier, you asked like different types of research, and let me sort of backtrack
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   a little bit.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.160]   What I'm talking about right now is called primary research.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.640]   There's a whole nother world called secondary research.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.980]   So if you're familiar with like organizations like Forrester or Nielsen, they do what we
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.520]   call secondary research.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.400]   And the difference between primary research and secondary research is, I'll go back to
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.560]   like Netflix, as an example, if you're in Netflix, one of the questions you have, you
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.200]   might have is like, hey, what are the trends like in streaming?
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.400]   And you and that's a very big question that maybe a lot of like, maybe Disney Plus has
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.860]   those questions, Hulu has those questions.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.400]   So someone like Forrester may have already done studies about like the landscape of like
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.840]   streaming media, right?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.560]   So that's secondary research.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.040]   That's basically research that's broadly applicable.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.240]   It's at the ready, assuming it's been done already.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.000]   The other world, I'm getting my hands straight.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.520]   Primary research is basically specific questions.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.280]   So like Netflix might have a question that's specific to Netflix, right?
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.360]   So maybe it's something along the lines of, oh, we being Netflix are really curious about
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.680]   the appetite for like Korean dramas outside of Korea, like, do we think that this is like
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.600]   something we should really double down on?
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.680]   Or like, are people like, I don't speak Korean, and therefore, it's not relevant to me.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.600]   So that's a primary research question.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.660]   So Netflix might commission a study specifically to answer that question.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:22.320]   And so I share that because those are two big worlds of research, primary and then secondary,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   which is already done.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.440]   So the world that I'm in is primary research, they're research questions that are specific
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.120]   to LinkedIn, specific to our members, specific to our situation.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.240]   And then so once you kind of like, those are two big schools, the other two big schools
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.000]   is qualitative research and quantitative research, right?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.500]   And so qualitative research is things like focus groups, one-on-one interviews.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.680]   Quantitative research tend to be survey-based research.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.800]   And I've done both in my career.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.840]   Right now, I'm more on the survey side, which is more quantitatively based.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:06.920]   But there is a path for either someone who wants to specialize in qualitative, someone
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.360]   who wants to specialize in quantitative, or someone who wants to exercise like both parts
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.720]   of those brains, and they kind of exercise different parts of your brains.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.000]   So it's kind of cool.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.600]   So there's some variety within the market research realm.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.280]   And then there's another way to kind of parse this out, which is market research.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.720]   And then there's user experience research.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.040]   These are all kind of like primary research, secondary research, qualitative, quantitative.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.440]   And then I'll stop here.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.040]   But the last one is market research, traditional market research, and then user experience
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.800]   research, which is another very big branch of research.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:50.880]   And so at a 30,000-foot level, user experience research tends-- now, not all of this is 100%,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.740]   but 90% of the time, it tends to be qualitative.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.960]   And it's typically about how a single person interacts with your product.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.200]   Like if I click this, what do you think is going to happen?
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.720]   Is this button in the right place?
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.700]   Like that sort of thing.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:09.680]   And then market research is more like at the broad, like hundreds, if not thousands of
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.960]   people level, trying to understand attitudes toward certain things, perceptions of different
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.500]   things, that sort of thing.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.080]   So that was a lot.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.440]   My apologies if I went too deep.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.480]   Those are like three kind of like dichotomous ways of looking at market, looking at research
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.480]   in general.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.360]   And I appreciate that, because that's so important.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.720]   And I'm thinking about like, companies like LinkedIn, they're large.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   You can afford to have all the disciplines, right?
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.000]   And I think the smaller you go, I'm thinking even my previous companies, like they would
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.440]   double down in certain areas and try to skate by on the other ones, just based on, again,
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.240]   maybe feedback from customers, maybe that's enough for the kind of usability piece of
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   it.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   And they kind of focus on something else.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   So I definitely see the need, ideally, to kind of double down on all of those.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.960]   Because again, they give you such different insights that can drive business decisions
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.720]   that ultimately impact the customer.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.000]   And so I appreciate that.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I'm kind of curious.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.840]   So LinkedIn, you mentioned earlier, you have like, there's like 1 billion users right now,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   or members.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   Nearly.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   Oh, nearly.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.000]   So obviously, like when you're running a test, like, typically, what is your size, your pool?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.800]   And how long does it normally take you to reach statistical significance based on whatever
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.120]   research you're conducting?
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.080]   So like in the community that I manage, and then even outside, like for the other market
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:34.880]   research managers, usually, at the very minimum, you're talking about like 100 plus people
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   per segment to reach statistical significance to be able to say, to make some broad statements.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.160]   Obviously, the more the better, and the more confidence you have.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.440]   But usually, at the minimum, we've got about 100 people per segment that we're trying to
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.720]   make statements about.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   Got it.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.520]   And what incentives do you use to either get them to participate, or even discover and
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.520]   find them?
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.520]   And find willing participants?
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   Right?
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.080]   So yeah, that's such a great question.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:10.760]   And I will say we are very typical, very atypical in the world that I'm in, whereby a lot of
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.280]   market research, either companies or market research groups within many companies will
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.320]   offer an incentive to take a survey.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.940]   So we in this community, there's no monetary incentive.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.960]   And so the way we've positioned the community, like, if you want to join the community, it's
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.560]   a very like, reciprocal relationship that we have with them.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   And so the idea behind the community is that they share back with us their feedback on
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.760]   like some new product idea.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:44.200]   And then we share back with them how LinkedIn is going to be better as a result of them
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.680]   having taken part in this research.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:52.440]   And so really, their payment is knowing that they're having an impact on their experience
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.480]   on LinkedIn.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:00.200]   And this is, I would say it's, it's unique, I wish it was not so unique.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   I really think that that is one of the ways that market research can thrive.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.160]   And I think that's one of the things that the industry needs to strive more for is not
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.800]   so much like paying people 5-10 bucks for for their time, because what we don't want
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.920]   at the end of the day is like a professional survey taker.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.720]   That's just gonna give us like, you know, five, five, five, five, like they're not,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.360]   they're not really thinking about it.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:30.320]   Like what I'm trying to do in this program that I manage at LinkedIn is basically offer
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.960]   value back to them.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.160]   That's not monetary, it's actually worth much more than 5-10 bucks.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:44.440]   It's basically, help me help you on LinkedIn, help me help, help me be the voice of you
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.880]   so that we can make better products for you that fit what you're looking for in your career.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.600]   Yeah, that's really helpful.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.880]   And in the B2B world, like there's, you might hear like partner champion programs or customer
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.720]   reference programs or brand advocates, and that's similar.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:04.640]   But I agree with you that detaching some kind of monetary reward, instead, instead of focusing
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.920]   on like making them feel like they're a part of your roadmap, is actually not only do you
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.960]   get better feedback from them, but they actually develop a closer tie and relationship to your
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.360]   brand because now they feel invested in having contributed to that.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   So that's, I agree.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.320]   Yeah, if more companies can do that, I think that'd be awesome.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.240]   Now, opportunity kind of fucks your muscles though here, Tony, like, I personally know
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.040]   you and how like awesome you are.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.600]   Can you give me some examples of some really big wins you've had that, whether influenced
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.560]   major strategy or decisions within a company, or maybe even from a product side, influenced
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.160]   or implemented major product feature?
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.160]   Oh my goodness.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.280]   I just, I just came back.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.440]   I'm sweating a little bit, not because of this interview.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.000]   I love like talking to you, Tim.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.400]   I actually came back from a Muay Thai kickboxing class that I'm taking right now, so I'm still
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.100]   like in the aftermath of that, but anyhow, no, back to back on topic.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:07.900]   I've got, I've got two examples I would share with you, things that I'm proud of in terms
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:14.440]   of how talking to our members actually shaped what LinkedIn did, hopefully for the better.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:26.080]   And so about a year ago, LinkedIn was trying to, was trying to break out of this, of this
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.960]   idea that it's all, like LinkedIn has to be all about work, 100% about work.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.520]   And what we, what we're trying to do is trying to be more holistic in terms of, yes, we never
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   want to be Facebook.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.200]   Like, let's get that like out of the way, right?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.360]   We do not want to be Facebook, but we recognize that like there's a whole bunch of stuff operating
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.680]   like on our periphery that affects our careers, affects our work life.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.880]   And so one of the studies that I did was basically about what types of content do you want to
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.520]   see on LinkedIn?
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.800]   And so in addition to those things that you might expect, like interviewing tips or negotiating
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.000]   tips or networking, you know, guides or things like that, there was a lot of things that
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.240]   were kind of like on the periphery of like your, your professional life.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.160]   And one of the things that one of those items was mental health.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:23.300]   And so mental health amongst like a whole bunch of other things that were not traditionally
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:32.320]   professional topics of discussion on LinkedIn, that was the one that really came out as being
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.720]   an area where our members wanted to talk about that and, and gave LinkedIn permission to
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.800]   talk about that.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   And so it was awesome.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   So like our editor in chief, Daniel Roth got, you know, was, was very interested in these
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.680]   results being the editor of content on LinkedIn.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.800]   And so he told me that, oh my goodness, Tony, this is awesome because like this is the area
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.160]   that we've been wanting to get into, but just wasn't sure whether we really would have permission
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.000]   from our members to talk about mental health on LinkedIn.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.520]   And fast forward a year, like I don't think it would be out of the ordinary to see mental
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.560]   health conversations take place on LinkedIn, how people are managing it, how people are
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.120]   coping with it as it relates to professional lives.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.640]   And so that was based on a study that where I don't know that we would have dared to venture
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.440]   in that area had it not been the, the, the guidance from our members through the community
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:36.840]   study that talked about that, where they shared that they were willing to, to see that conversation,
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.800]   to participate in that conversation.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.440]   So, so that's, that's one example that I'm pretty proud of in the last year.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.880]   And that's an example where member feedback gave us permission or gave us the go ahead
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.120]   to do something.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.800]   I'll share another example.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:58.240]   This is actually the opposite is where we chose not to do something because members
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.320]   said that is not what we wanted to do.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:08.600]   So the context for this next example is, is this idea of sharing your, your thoughts on
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.480]   LinkedIn anonymously.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.460]   And so at the time we call this like masked identity, right?
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:21.800]   So the idea behind it, the positive idea behind it is that someone may not be willing or brave
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:27.640]   enough to share their thoughts for risk of cancellation or their boss seeing it, what
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   have you.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.160]   They're just not comfortable sharing some thought on LinkedIn.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:38.920]   And so the idea was like, Hey, what if we gave members the ability to share this anonymously?
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.400]   And so one of the things we've been doing within the insight community is a lot is,
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.520]   is, is concept testing and concept testing in a very consistent way so that we have a
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:54.520]   benchmark in terms of whether 62% of audiences liking something, is that good?
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.520]   Is that bad?
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.240]   And so we have like a benchmark of of like the average concept.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:06.480]   And so anyways, this whole idea of being able to share anonymously was our lowest performing
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.320]   concepts.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.360]   And so it was a very clear sign that, well, while I, well, I think we all understand the
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   rationale behind it, it's something that our members like, like, no.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.480]   And the number one reason, as you might guess, is that they did not want LinkedIn to turn
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:31.560]   into like into Reddit where people like to say whatever they want to say without recourse
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.360]   or without a second thought.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:40.020]   And so we, that's an example of where like market research saved us from going in a direction
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.240]   that that maybe we may have without member guidance.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.040]   Yeah, I think that's, I would have agreed with that result as well.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.800]   I think I would have voted the same like it that the unique thing about LinkedIn is like
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.320]   taking ownership of what you say and that that kind of representing and reflecting
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.760]   on you as an individual, usually, hopefully for the better, right, but can obviously go
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   the other direction.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.840]   And being able to like, do it in a masked way can result in a lot of content that's
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.640]   probably not maybe even professional on this.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:10.760]   Yeah, like very much of LinkedIn is all based on the reliability of your profile, right?
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.100]   You are, you are, you're proud of what you're saying, what you're putting out in the world.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.840]   So I think this kind of went against that.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.840]   Cool.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:24.080]   So talking back about the fundamentals of market research, you know, like, can you help
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:31.360]   me understand what skills are, do hiring managers look for or skills that someone brings to
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.120]   the table that are, are paramount for succeeding in this role?
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.360]   And I'm kind of thinking about different kinds of people, right?
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.080]   So one audience could be someone who is maybe looking to transition into market research
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.280]   and trying to figure out, do their skills translate to maybe an entry level role?
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.280]   And there's the other side of it, which is like, you're a practitioner and you're trying
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.920]   to become an even more seasoned expert.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.960]   So can you kind of help us kind of get a little bit of the land of what to look out for?
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:03.280]   Yeah, yeah, I, it's a great question.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.160]   I, I'm trying to think about this conversation, how I like, honestly, I'm trying to think
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.920]   about like, how can I add like unique value?
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.880]   Because anyone can kind of like chat GPT or Google, like, what are the core skills of
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.480]   like a market researcher?
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.400]   And I think a lot of things will come down, like analytical skills and Excel skills and
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.760]   presentation skills and that sort of thing.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:33.400]   I, I would like to take a step back and like, just in my experience, like specifically,
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:41.160]   if you want to kind of differentiate yourself, it's so much about the soft skills and just
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   being able to like relate to people, to have a genuine curiosity for why people do the
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.560]   things they do, why they like the things they like, why they don't like the things that
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.120]   they don't like.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:01.040]   It's being very comfortable, like in a collaborative environment.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.480]   This, this, this job is very much like a people person job.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.040]   It's like a team oriented job.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:15.720]   Like I'm at any one point in time, I'm usually working with some combination of PMMs, PMs,
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:22.960]   product managers, brand people, operational people, biz ops people, and, and it's very
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.660]   much a cross functional team effort.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:33.640]   It's also important that I should be a little cautious about saying this, but I'm going
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.440]   to say it because that's kind of how I see it.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.680]   You should be comfortable being a supporter at the end of the day.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.920]   You're very much in a supportive function of like product and marketing.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.520]   You're trying to help product shine.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.360]   You're trying to help marketing shine.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.700]   There's moments for you to shine as a market research expert as well, but ultimately you're
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.060]   part of a greater team.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:59.440]   So I think like it's this whole being comfortable with that, being like being that, being like
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.060]   the place where you want to be, where you're kind of wired that way.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.000]   I think it's helpful.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.180]   So all those sort of like soft skills are helpful along with like being analytical and
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.640]   like learning research methodology.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.480]   I'll dive back more into like the more practical side of things too.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.360]   So like research methodology, yeah, you could learn it from, you know, like from books or
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.080]   like resources online, practically speaking.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.640]   And I think that's kind of will be pertinent to people who are interested in a career in
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.160]   market research.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.960]   I tend to think that it's great to start on the, on the agency side.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.560]   So like earlier I had all those like, you know, this or that.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.400]   So in market research, you could be on the agent, you can be on the agency side, which
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.480]   is basically a market research agency that is providing market research services to a
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.500]   whole plethora of clients.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.760]   Or you could be on the client side.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:02.280]   You could work like within a market research department, like within a Netflix or a state
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.440]   farm or what have you.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.160]   So I, my, my strong recommendation is if you're first starting out, this is how I started
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:15.680]   as well is to start on the agency side, because on the agency side, you learn all sorts of
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.360]   different research methodologies.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.200]   That's where I learned to do both quantitative and qualitative research.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.560]   They all have like their nuances.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.320]   They all have their specialties within those broad sectors.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.920]   You also get to learn to work with different industries.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.200]   So when I was on the agency side, I was very fortunate to work with an agency that had
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   really like great clients.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   So at any one point in time, I was working with like Microsoft and EA and Adobe, but
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:51.160]   at the same time, I was also working with Pillsbury and Dreyer's ice cream, and then
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.720]   like a whole other sphere with all sorts of like insurance or visa finances or something
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   like that.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:04.240]   So I highly suggest like starting out like on the agency side if, yeah, if you're able
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.520]   to, because that's where you can get a lot of different experiences.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520]   I would totally agree with that.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.200]   And that's actually how I started my career in digital marketing as well.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:17.240]   And to your point, you get to experience breadth, and then depth and the ability to move around
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.040]   because like within agencies, they also kind of depends on how big or small they are.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.840]   But everyone kind of needs to kind of pitch in and apply to various disciplines.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.080]   And to your point, it gives you exposure, either direct exposure or observing someone
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.360]   else doing it, and you kind of passively kind of kind of grow that skill set, even though
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   you're not practicing it.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.280]   So that's a really, really good call out.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.720]   I'm even thinking, I'm hoping this is unique to this current market today, right?
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.440]   But like, right now, like, leveraging external resources versus hiring for internal, there's
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.520]   obviously the current economy is harder for people to hire dedicated market researchers.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.320]   So you might just naturally find more opportunity on an agency right now, as it is, again, I'm
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.400]   really hoping that this market kind of turns itself around, but that's kind of where I'm
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   seeing a shift.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.360]   And it applies to digital marketing as well.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.080]   I'm seeing those trends, too.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.560]   Yeah, so I really appreciate that.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.520]   It actually gives me a lot of hope, quite frankly, Tony, because I don't know if I ever
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.640]   admitted this to you.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.720]   About like two years ago, I was like, considering a career change as well.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.920]   I was like, Oh, man, can I do some market research?
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   And I was like, Oh, no, no.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.440]   I know, Tony, I don't want to look like an idiot to him.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.360]   I don't want to ask, but it but part of the things that caused me to not want to reach
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:33.800]   out to you besides pride, or whatever I call it, is just, I want to make it look like I've
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   got my stuff together.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.400]   And I was afraid that I didn't.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.640]   And what you're telling me here, which is really helpful is like, yes, there's some
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.440]   hard skills, you definitely need to know.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.240]   But the the soft skills part is so important.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.600]   And that's, I think, something that a non practitioner has.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.200]   And so I think if you're listening to this video, and that's where you find yourself,
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.200]   like, don't be discouraged from considering market research at all, as a matter of fact,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.720]   like maybe lean into it a little bit, because your natural skills might actually kind of
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   take you ahead.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.440]   And you just would know if you don't give yourself a chance.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   Cool.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:10.040]   So Tony, can you help us understand just just career growth in market research?
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.840]   Like, like, what does an entry level position normally look like?
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.760]   And what is for someone like in your role, who's been kind of obviously more seasoned?
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.000]   Like, what does growth look like?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.920]   So I can I can speak to my own career, which I think is a is a fairly linear path that
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.360]   someone could follow.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.720]   So like I said, I started on the agency side.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:37.960]   And I started out being as I worked on in a market research agency, but not so much
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.680]   in a market research specific role.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.880]   So my role was that of a we call it a data coordinator.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.000]   And so the whole idea is that I worked with a lot of market research managers to basically
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.040]   get the data from the research studies into like PowerPoint decks.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.360]   And so I did that I did a lot of that.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.200]   And so I did that for about a year.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:01.640]   And then after a while, I had an opening for an assistant research manager.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.720]   And obviously just be kind of marinating in that world for a while, like I became an assistant
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.960]   research manager, realize I loved it, like I was very much in my sweet spot.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:17.240]   And by sweet spot, I mean, I'll take you back to college real quick.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.960]   I didn't declare a major until I think my junior year.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.920]   And I knew I wanted to do something in marketing, but I didn't feel I was creative enough to
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.980]   do marketing.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.880]   But I also knew I love my psychology classes.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:36.680]   So market research and psychology, psychology, and, and marketing kind of like fits, it kind
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.080]   of becomes market research.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.920]   And so I knew that's what I wanted to do.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.160]   And so sure enough, like in that first legitimate market research role, I really felt like,
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.800]   yes, like this is what I wanted to do.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.680]   I had a curiosity for people, I was kind of okay with numbers.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:57.660]   I'm Asian, I hate math, I'm doing okay, but I'm not I'm not a mathematician, not a mathematician.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:02.140]   So don't let the word the fact I'm using the word data, this is very straightforward data
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.580]   that very is very basic data.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:10.720]   So so yeah, so from from being an assistant research manager became research manager.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:17.480]   And then from from the agency side, I went to visa, where I got to experience life on
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.160]   the on the client side, which has a lot of benefits.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.720]   So in terms of growth, I would say, my apologies, if I'm jumping back.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   No, this is perfect.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.880]   You're doing great.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:35.040]   One of the things that what growth may look one of the dimensions of growth is how much
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:41.720]   visibility do you have to the person actually making use of your data and the insights from
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.000]   your studies.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.360]   So like, when I was a data coordinator, I had zero visibility, I they hid me in the
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.720]   back room in the corner somewhere.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:56.000]   And then as an as an assistant research manager, I was like the silent person in the room.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.160]   So like the research managers interfacing with the client, I'm there like taking notes,
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.320]   doing the best that I can not to look like if like a fool not to say anything stupid.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.120]   And then when I became a research manager, then I like had amassed enough knowledge enough
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:17.080]   confidence to to be able to talk to the clients.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.280]   And then when I became a senior research manager, that's when I made the jump from being able
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.600]   to talk the language to being able to consult and like, and to basically translate like
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:32.060]   their business questions into research solutions.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.400]   So earlier, like, let's say like, we were, let's say we're working on Netflix, and Netflix
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:43.180]   had the question of, hey, should we double down on Korean content like outside of Korea?
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.200]   And so I'd be as a research manager, I would have to come up with like the proper research
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.640]   solution.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.520]   Is it is a primary research?
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.840]   Is it secondary research?
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.840]   Is it quantitative?
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.240]   Is it qualitative?
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.920]   And then like, so on down the line, and so I would be able to like consult on that.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.360]   And then so from there, I left and went to the to the client side at Visa.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.480]   And then when you're on the client side, you're even closer yet to the people who are acting
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   on it, right?
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.360]   Because on the agency side, you may be working with you may be working with a market researcher
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.880]   at the client, not even the people who are making use of that data, that study.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.000]   And so when you're on the client side, you're working with the PMMs, you're working with
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.920]   the product, the people who are making the products, you're working with, yeah, the people
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:36.700]   who are basically implementing the studies that that you're you're executing on.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.960]   And so, yeah, I would say that's probably one dimension, that's the one that comes that's
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:46.840]   most apparent to me, it's just kind of like, how, how removed or how close at the hip are
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.080]   you to the people?
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.840]   How much of a partner are you to those people who are actually doing it and executing on
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   on the studies?
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.640]   Yeah, that's really good, actually, that you even kind of hinted at another skill set here,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.320]   which is, I don't know if it's a software hard skill set, but the ability to take a
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:09.240]   lot of information, and then distill it down and framed in a way that can be used in research,
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.240]   right?
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.040]   Because again, like, someone can have like five disparate ideas, and they think it's
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.920]   one singular thought for a business objective, and you're like, actually, maybe, maybe it's
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.400]   being able to ask the right questions to kind of get to the crux of what you want, and then
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.120]   taking that and framing it into a test, I think that that ability to kind of logically
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.160]   work through that is probably really good.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:34.480]   And I liked also the part we talked about, like how you engage with people, I think about
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:40.280]   even my own career, right, the, the, there's a lot of ways where you can show value to
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.600]   either a peer or a manager, right?
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.200]   One of them is like, because you sit so close to the data to the research, providing value
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.360]   could look like, hey, I've noticed something else in the data that might be worth looking
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:56.880]   at, or have we considered this or when someone comes to you with a research idea, maybe,
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.000]   as you kind of help them qualify or, or substantiate the request, maybe there's a different way
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   of looking at it.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.200]   And those questions, while they may not become executed upon, like that sets you apart as
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   well, right?
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   That's providing value.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.960]   I think those are the kind of thinking mechanisms or skill sets that I at least look for when
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.240]   I'm looking for direct, for even junior folks, like if they show that I'm like, oh, that's
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.440]   like kind of rockstar quality, because you're coachable, right, and that attitude is important.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.040]   So that, that, that kind of speaks to like, to another continuum too, right?
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.880]   If it's not evident, I love these continuum, but I'm also working on my camera, spatial
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   skills here.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   It's a continuum between like, just like supplying data versus like making sense of data and
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.280]   then like, kind of like, you know, driving value from that data.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   Cool.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.880]   So this question, maybe closing question for you is just like, you know, if you think of
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.280]   a typical person, maybe who's trying to consider a new career in market research, like you
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.480]   should consider a market research if blank, you know, or maybe you should not consider
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:04.120]   it for blank, like what would those look like to you?
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:15.640]   So I think first and foremost is just like a natural curiosity for, for human behavior.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.840]   I think more because at the end of the day, a lot of this is just being intellectually
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.520]   curious about why people think the way they do.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   So that's part of it.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.400]   So intellectual curiosity, you know, earlier I talked about like the team orientation,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.000]   you're part of like a broader team to accomplish something.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   You're not like a soul, like Lone Ranger, Rockstar out there.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.400]   You're part of a collective effort.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   So it's, it's good for someone who's, who, who functions that way and it's comfortable
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.960]   in those environments.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.600]   You have to be a good communicator, both verbally as well as written.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:36:01.460]   There's a lot of like communication, presentations, that sort of thing.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.200]   So like communications, and that's not just market research.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:10.440]   I think I'll serve you well in any, in any, any discipline.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.960]   There's probably a ton more, but I would kind of stop there.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.960]   I think it's good.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   It's really helpful.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.920]   And like, I really enjoyed this conversation today, Tony.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.740]   I think you have a lot of really good insights on like how to practice the skill and industry
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:24.740]   of market research.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.840]   But I think you're kind of your real life applications kind of really helps humanize
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.840]   the experience.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.760]   And I think in a way that people can relate to and, and for those viewers out there who
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.880]   are trying to consider a career, like hopefully this inspired you to maybe dig deep or do
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.440]   some research and learn more about it.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.920]   I definitely think as a seasoned professional, you gave them a lot of things to think about.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.880]   I think areas to hone the craft and maybe they, you actually identified the six areas
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.960]   essentially of market, of research and maybe other areas that maybe other muscles they
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.680]   want to flex because maybe they've been overly focused on market research.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.760]   Maybe I'll do something else within the research field.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.000]   So I think this is really good.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.700]   Tony, thank you for your time and hopefully you can come back soon and talk about something
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.700]   else.
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:04.700]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.700]   100.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.080]   And before we go, like, I think I'm in a season of my life where I mentioned I'm almost
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.200]   like in market research for 30 years.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.460]   So I think I'm very much in a season of giving back.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:19.500]   So if any of your viewers like wanted to talk market research, working at LinkedIn, what
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.920]   have you, in more depth, happy, reach out to me on LinkedIn and happy to chat.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.840]   How can they find you on LinkedIn?
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.920]   Just Tony Tong, market research should do it.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.920]   Cool.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   All right.
