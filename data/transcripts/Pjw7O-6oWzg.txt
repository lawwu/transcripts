[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.120]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in chapter 6, reading verses 10 to 13.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:21.400]   From verse 10 to verse 13, in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, "Finally,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:29.240]   my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; put on the whole armour
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.480]   of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.120]   For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.280]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.280]   places.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.320]   Wherefore, take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.200]   the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.840]   We resume once more our study of this great and most important statement which the Apostle
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.040]   here makes at the end of this epistle of his to the Ephesians.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.920]   Now we've been looking at this statement so far in general, in very general terms,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.300]   and it is essential that we should have done so.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.800]   We have seen that the Apostle takes the trouble to remind us of the character and the nature
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.640]   of the enemy confronting us, the devil, the principalities, the powers, the rulers, the
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:52.280]   world rulers of this darkness, spiritual forces, forces of spiritual evil, even in high or
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.560]   in heavenly places.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.720]   And we have further considered the activity of these powers under the devil.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.280]   And we have looked at the activity again in a very general way.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.640]   We have seen that these activities can be classified in certain respects, and we've
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.080]   looked at them.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.320]   And then having done that, we have, in order to encourage ourselves as the Apostle is concerned
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.440]   to do here, we have been considering again in a very general way what God has done about
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   all this.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.360]   Here is the position, and it's essential that we should hold this large general position
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360]   in our minds.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.440]   Here it is, "God made the world and made it perfect."
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.480]   Very well.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.200]   The question that obviously must arise in every mind is, "Well, if God made the world
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.120]   and made it perfect, why is it as it is this morning?"
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.640]   And the answer is, the devil and the principalities and powers.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.960]   The devil entered into God's perfect creation, tempted men, men in his folly fell, and the
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.520]   result is the trouble and the confusion and the chaos that one reads of in the whole history
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.440]   of the human race up until this moment, and all that we see in the world this moment.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   Very well.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.120]   This is the work of the devil.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.080]   But God has done something about this, and we've again been reviewing that in general.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.040]   That is the great story of the Bible, the history of redemption, what God has done to
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.800]   counteract and to deal with the efforts and the malignity of the devil and these evil
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   fossils.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.160]   Now we've seen that this has come to a kind of focus in the coming of our Lord and Savior
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.360]   Jesus Christ.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.200]   The last Sunday morning we considered these matters was the Sunday before Christmas.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.040]   And there we saw that the primary object, in a sense, of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.920]   Christ was that he might destroy the works of the devil.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.200]   And we again took a general view of that.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.400]   And we saw how in every way our Lord defeated the devil, in every respect.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.480]   The devil's attempts to kill him when he was born and was but an infant.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.720]   The way he repulsed him and defeated him utterly in the temptations in the wilderness.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.300]   The way he cast out devils, and especially the way in which he finally put him to an
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.920]   open shame by his death upon the cross, and then by the mighty resurrection, proving that
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.560]   he can conquer even the last enemy, which is death, over which the devil has been exercising
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.600]   control and authority.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.640]   And we looked into the future.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.360]   And we saw that this great movement of redemption is to go on until the end, when Christ shall
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.560]   return and the devil and all these principalities and powers shall finally be cast into a lake
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.880]   of destruction, finally destroyed from the presence of the Lord.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.880]   Very well.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.500]   Now there is the general position, the point at which we have arrived.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.960]   But now having done that, we must come to the realm of practical application.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.280]   You notice the method, and it's always the biblical method.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.960]   The Bible never starts with details.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.700]   The Bible always starts with great, broad principles.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.720]   And any Christian teaching that immediately comes to details, that starts on the practical
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.200]   level, is already wrong.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.920]   The Bible never does that.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.120]   The practical is the outcome of the theoretical.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.120]   It's the application of the great principles of truth.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.000]   So we must carry in our minds always what we've been seeing in general.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.760]   But having looked at that and grasping it and keeping it with us, we now must come on
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   to the realm of practical application.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.000]   So I can put it as a question.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.080]   What now then is the present position?
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:27.360]   God creates, the devil comes in, God starts and initiates the movement of salvation.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.260]   Christ has been, has done his work, has returned to heaven, he is waiting until his enemies
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.080]   shall be made his footstool.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.520]   The final victory is certain and assured.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.680]   Very well, but what is the present position?
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.880]   Somebody may very well and very rightly put that question.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.080]   This is all very well, they say, to look at this great position that you're putting before
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.960]   us, but I'm living in this world and I'm surrounded by difficulties.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.600]   What is the position at the present moment, in the light of all that we've seen?
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.440]   Well now that's the right question to ask, and the position as described in the Bible
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.360]   is this.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:14.200]   We see a clear division, a division between the world and the people of God.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.560]   Now that is the first thing which we have to grasp at the present time.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.000]   Take it as it was put so perfectly to us in that chapter which we read at the beginning,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.400]   in the first epistle of John, in chapter 5, and in verse 19, where we read at the end
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.820]   that the whole world lieth in wickedness.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:45.680]   Now there is a most important statement, the whole world lieth in wickedness.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:53.920]   A better translation is to say that the whole world lieth in the wicked one, in the evil
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.880]   one.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.480]   The world, as it were, is lying this morning in the embrace of Satan.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:07.680]   That's the statement, and of course it is a very crucial statement.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   The devil is controlling the mind and the outlook of the world.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.560]   Now the world here means, of course, everybody and everything that is not truly and rightly
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.040]   related to God.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.200]   The world means mankind apart from God, man living according to his own understanding,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.360]   according to his own will, according to his own desires.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.060]   The world is just the opposite of the church, if you like.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.960]   The world is the opposite of the Christian.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.800]   And the statement that is made is that at this present moment, though the Lord Jesus
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.080]   Christ has been and has lived and died and risen again and is seated at the right hand
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:54.080]   of God's power and has all authority in his hands, the fact is that the world, men
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:02.920]   and women who don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, are lying in the wicked one,
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.080]   in his embrace, in his clutches.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:14.400]   The world is lying helplessly in the arms of the devil, utterly entirely controlled
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   by him.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.040]   Now, we mustn't stay with this.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.560]   In a sense, we've already been looking at it.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.040]   But in this very epistle that we are studying, we saw the apostle putting it so clearly in
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.960]   the second chapter, in the second verse, where he says, having said that, "Ye worthy quickened
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.520]   who were dead in trespasses and sins," wherein he says in time past, "Ye walked according
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:45.360]   to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the Spirit,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.720]   that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   That's it.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.520]   That is still the position of the children of disobedience.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.720]   They are walking according to, after the manner of, under the control of, under the direction
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.600]   of the prince of the power of the air, the devil again, these principalities and powers.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.360]   And that is the position of the world at this very moment.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:18.040]   Another effect, of course, of this is that they are entirely governed in their thinking.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.720]   So the apostle tells us in 2 Corinthians 4, "For if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.320]   that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.680]   not, lest they believe the glorious gospel of God."
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:40.000]   Very well, there they are, and that's the sole explanation of unbelief.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.680]   People who don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ this morning are in that position for
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.360]   one reason only, that they are blinded by the devil.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.640]   It isn't their learning, it isn't their knowledge, it isn't their understanding.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.760]   They think it is, of course, and thereby they are just proving how utterly the devil has
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.640]   duped them, how securely they are lying in the devil.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.920]   They are unaware of this, but they are blinded, they can't see.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.280]   And another manifestation of this, of course, is all that we read about in symbolic manner,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.320]   especially in the 13th chapter of the book of Revelation.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.400]   The beasts, the beast arising from the sea, the beast arising from the land, the image
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.520]   of the beast, all these forces that are arranged against God and that are controlling the mind
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.960]   and the outlook and the way of the world this morning.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:41.440]   All that is just a manifestation of this basic fundamental truth that the whole world lieth
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.480]   in the wicked one.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:51.680]   There it is, entirely controlled by him, not only politically, but industrially, and all
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.000]   these turmoils and quarrels and disputes, all rivalry and jealousy and envy, it's all
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.080]   a part of the work of the devil.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:05.040]   He keeps mankind in this kind of condition, and as he does so, of course, he taunts God
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   and turns to God and says, "There's your handiwork, there's your creation.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.120]   This is the world which you say you've made and of which you've busted.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.240]   You looked at it and you saw that it was good, there it is."
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:24.320]   Very well, there is one side of our picture, that the whole world lieth in the wicked one.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.600]   And if ever this was obvious, it ought to be this morning.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.240]   You listen to the news, do you read your papers, don't you see it?
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:42.680]   All this restlessness, all this unhappiness, this turmoil, this dis-ease, it's entirely
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:51.040]   due to this one thing, that the world is lying in the clutches and the embrace of the wicked
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   one.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.200]   Very well, there's one side, thank God there's another side.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   And the other side, of course, is the position of Christians, the position of Christian people.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.440]   Now this is the great thing, that's the thing the apostle is concerned about in this
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.120]   very chapter that we are considering together.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.480]   That's why he writes this particular statement.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:20.360]   He wants Christian people to know exactly where they stand in the light of all this.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.040]   What difference exactly has the coming of Jesus Christ made to us?
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.760]   That's the question in a sense.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.440]   And here his statement is, of course, as it is the teaching of the New Testament everywhere,
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:39.400]   that the position has entirely changed for Christian people.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.280]   Not for anybody else.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.800]   The world is still there, lying in the wicked one, as if Christ had never been at all.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.040]   And isn't that obvious?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.360]   Think of the millions of people today who are living exactly as if the Son of God had
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.720]   never been in this world.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.960]   You could blot him out of history, it wouldn't make the slightest difference to them.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.240]   They'd still go on thinking in the same way, they'd still go on living in the same
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   way.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.160]   He's made no difference to them.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.440]   But to those who believe in him, he has made an entire difference.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.600]   There is a complete transformation.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.000]   Now this is the thing on which we've got to concentrate.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.680]   What is the difference he's made?
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.120]   Well, let's put it like this.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.480]   Let us start again with that basic statement which was made by our Lord himself.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.520]   You've got it in Luke 11 verse 22.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:34.840]   Well, I remind you once more that he says that the world was like this.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.360]   The strong man armed, that's the devil, keepeth his goods in peace.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.800]   That's the devil controlling others, that's the world lying in the wicked one.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.880]   But, he says, when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him, he taketh
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:55.920]   from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.720]   Now that's where we come in.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.520]   We wear nothing but the goods of the devil.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.720]   But this stronger than the devil has come in, and this is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   The patriarchs couldn't do it, the prophets couldn't do it, nobody could do it, Christ
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.000]   the Son of God has come, he's vanquished him, he has taken from him his armour wherein
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   he trusted.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.600]   And having done that, what has he done?
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.320]   Well, he divideth his spoils, taketh them from him.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.000]   And this is what happens to the man who becomes a Christian.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.520]   He is taken out of the clutches of the strong man armed and set in a new position.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.560]   Now the Bible is full of this.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.200]   That is of course what our Lord himself said to Saul of Tarsus when he met him on the road
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   to Damascus.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:49.040]   He said, "It's all right, I've appeared to you, because I'm going to make of you a minister
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.040]   and a witness.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.840]   I'm going to give you," he says, "this great task, and your task is to be this, that you
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:02.320]   are to be a light unto the people, that you are to turn them from darkness to light, and
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:10.240]   from the power of Satan unto God, that they might have an inheritance among them that
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.040]   are sanctified in me."
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.360]   Now there again is a crucial statement.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:23.320]   Turning from darkness to light, but from the power of Satan unto God.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:29.280]   No longer lying in the wicked one, set free, free to serve God and to live a life which
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.720]   is well-pleasing to God.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:39.160]   Or listen again to the Apostle Paul putting it in the epistle to the Colossians in the
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:47.840]   first chapter in verse 13, "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.500]   us into the kingdom of his dear Son."
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.240]   Now my friends, this is Christianity, you see.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.840]   It isn't just to believe in forgiveness and to be a little bit better than you used to
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.840]   be.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.840]   You've been translated.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.560]   There's a mighty movement, you're no longer there, you're here.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:11.480]   Deliver us out of, from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.400]   Oh, it's not surprising the Apostle should put it like that, is it?
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.880]   That's what the Lord had told him on the road to Damascus.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.960]   He'd experienced it himself.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.880]   And he says to these Colossians, "This is what's happened to you.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.840]   This is what he's done.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.720]   He's moved us, he's delivered us, translated us."
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.320]   But of course the Apostle Peter is very anxious to say the same thing.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.200]   "Do you know what you are?" he says to the people to whom he writes in his first epistle,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.480]   second chapter, verses nine and ten.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.880]   He says, "Do you realize what you are as Christian people?
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:53.400]   You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:59.840]   may show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.160]   light, who were not a people, but are now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy,
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.440]   but now have obtained mercy."
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.880]   And then he goes on, you see, "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims."
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.400]   Why are they strangers and pilgrims?
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.720]   Well, because they no longer belong to the world.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.520]   They are in it, but they are not of it, they are not like these other people.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.360]   They were, they were not a people, but are now the people of God.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.920]   You haven't obtained mercy, but now you have obtained mercy.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.480]   "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.960]   war against the soul."
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   You see the idea.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.660]   It's all emphasizing this tremendous transformation, this great translation, this taking out of
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.360]   darkness into the marvelous light of God.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   And then we go back again to John, in that first epistle, chapter 5, and again in verse
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:11.120]   19, "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one."
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:21.100]   Well, there it is stated, perhaps most perfectly of all, "We and they, we and the world,
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.420]   the world lieth in the wicked one."
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.020]   We, we don't.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.020]   We are of God.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.180]   They are not of God, they are of the world.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.400]   We are of God.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.200]   Now this is exactly what the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ has done.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.540]   There is this great division in humanity this morning, "Oh, I know there's ignorant men
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.060]   of the world outside, and many an ignorant man in the church," says, "Oh, but you're
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.060]   boasting.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.060]   You're praising yourselves.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.260]   You're saying we, your typical Pharisees, no, no, we are not.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.640]   We are saying that we are this not because of anything we've done, but because of what
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.940]   God has done to us.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.720]   We've been translated.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.740]   It's the one who is stronger than the strong man armed who's done it.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.580]   We are not this because we've got might or power or understanding.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.580]   It's the power of Christ that has delivered us and set us free and put us into this new
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.580]   position."
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:20.640]   Now, there is the thing, therefore, which entitles us to say, "We are of God, and the
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:27.020]   whole world lieth in the wicked one."
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.540]   Oh, well, then there's something.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.180]   It's all right.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.180]   We've been delivered.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.100]   We've been translated out of darkness into light.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.300]   We are no longer in the clutches of the devil.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.060]   Very well, there's no more trouble in the Christian life.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.740]   The story is now, they all lived happily ever afterwards.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.420]   Everything's all right, is it?
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.020]   Is that your experience?
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.020]   Of course it isn't.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.980]   Well, now, then, here's the problem, isn't it?
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:21:00.060]   There are these tremendous, exhilarating, moving statements which seem to say that everything's
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.980]   been done and we are all right.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:12.420]   And yet we know that we're in a world of struggle, of trial and of difficulty, of sin
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.420]   and of temptation.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.820]   Now, then, how do we explain all this?
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.460]   Well, now, that's exactly, of course, what the Apostle is doing in these verses that
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.340]   we are considering together.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.580]   The position you see is this, that in spite of these things which I've been repeating
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:35.700]   again, being absolutely true, the devil is still, nevertheless, able to attack us and
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:40.300]   does attack us.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:49.060]   Because in writing to Christians we find this kind of term, "You are adversary of the devil."
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.420]   Roaming about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.680]   And even here the Apostle puts it, "We wrestle not."
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.620]   He's talking about Christians, remember, "We wrestle."
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:07.500]   You're not lying on a bed of ease, you're not just there lying in the sunshine in this
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:15.740]   new position, with no difficulty, no struggle, no effort, "We wrestle."
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.660]   These are the terms of the New Testament, "Fight the good fight of faith."
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.100]   It's a fight, it's a wrestle.
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.700]   And any teaching that takes those terms out of the New Testament teaching is not New Testament
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.700]   teaching.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.820]   It may be good psychology, but it's not New Testament.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.100]   "We wrestle."
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.780]   And we are assured here that we'll have to go on wrestling.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.940]   Well, now, then, the question that arises is, "How do we fit this into what we've already
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:42.940]   seen?"
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:50.940]   And, thank God, the Scripture makes it quite plain to us.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:56.540]   How can you say at one and the same time, says somebody, that you've been delivered,
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.300]   that Christ has taken the strong man armed and divided his spoil?
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.460]   How can you say that you've been turned from the power of Satan unto God, and that you've
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:11.420]   been translated, and still say that here you are, you're still having to wrestle and fight,
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.380]   and you're still being tempted grievously by the devil and by the principalities and
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.380]   powers?
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.380]   How do you reconcile it all?
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.780]   Well, fortunately, we can do so, and do so once more, in the light of what we read in
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:29.460]   that first epistle of John, again in chapter 5, but this time verse 18.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.420]   It throws light on our text this morning.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.420]   It's the same thing stated in another way.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.420]   Listen to it.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:39.940]   "We know that whatsoever, that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.420]   of God keepeth himself."
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.060]   Don't worry about that at the moment.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:49.840]   Probably a better translation there is, "But he that is begotten of God keepeth him."
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:57.460]   But this is the phrase, "And that wicked one toucheth him not."
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:04.060]   Now, there is no more comforting and consoling word that I know of from the practical standpoint
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:11.340]   of living the Christian life and resisting temptation than that word, "toucheth."
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.740]   That wicked one toucheth him not.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:21.500]   So he can go on to say, "We are of God, little children, and the whole world lieth in the
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.500]   wicked one."
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.620]   You see, the important distinction is this.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:30.860]   It's the difference between lying in the evil one and being in a position in which that
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.580]   evil one toucheth us not.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:40.300]   But obviously the meaning, the exact connotation of this word, "toucheth," is all important.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.760]   What does it mean?
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:51.300]   Does it literally mean what one would imagine it to mean by the word, "touch"?
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.340]   When we talk about touching a thing, we mean just what I'm doing now to that Bible.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.460]   I've just touched it.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.620]   I haven't taken hold of it.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.620]   I've touched it.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.500]   That's what we normally mean by "touch."
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.540]   But that is most certainly not the meaning here of the word that was used by the Apostle
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.260]   John.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.620]   Now what exactly does it mean?
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:17.460]   Well, we get great light on this if we go to the Gospel according to St. John in chapter
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.300]   20 and verse 17.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:24.420]   There, you remember, you've got an account of something that happened after our Lord
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.700]   had risen from the dead.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:35.260]   There he is, and confronted by Mary.
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:42.500]   You remember, he suddenly appeared to Mary, and Jesus saith unto her, "Mary?"
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.080]   She hadn't recognized him up until this point.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:52.100]   She turned herself and saith unto him, "Rabboni," which is to say, "Master."
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:59.500]   Jesus saith unto her, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:04.980]   But go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father,
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.420]   and to my God, and your God."
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.020]   Now there is the word "touch" once more.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.540]   What's it mean?
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.740]   Is our Lord just saying there to Mary, "Don't touch me"?
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.980]   Of course he isn't.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.980]   What had happened?
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.980]   Well, what had happened was this.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.060]   Mary hadn't recognized him.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:26.660]   Suddenly, as he speaks to her, and says the word, "Mary," she realizes who he is.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.660]   And what does she do?
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.740]   She immediately takes hold of him.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.120]   She clings to him.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.020]   And our Lord says, "Don't cling to me, Mary.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.400]   Don't hold on to me like this.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.360]   Everything is changed now.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.820]   You are reverting to the position before I was crucified, and died, and had risen again.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.120]   You're trying to keep me on earth.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   No, no.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120]   I'm finished with that.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   I'm now in the new realm.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.960]   I'm going to ascend to my Father, and to your Father.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   Don't hold on to me.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.320]   Don't cling to me.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.980]   Don't clutch me."
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:59.260]   Now, that is the meaning of the word there, and it is exactly the meaning of the word
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:06.060]   in this first epistle of John, in chapter 5, and in verse 18.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:12.740]   It tells us that that wicked one, or that evil one, can no longer hold on to us.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.820]   He can no longer grasp us.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.220]   He can no longer get us into his clutches.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:26.620]   And so, you see, the next verse, the 19th verse, follows quite naturally.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:32.620]   And indeed, the 19th verse insists upon our translating and interpreting this word "toucheth"
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.620]   in the way that we are now doing.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.820]   It is because he has said that the evil one can never get hold of you again, and get you
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.620]   into his clutches, and embrace you, that he says, "You are of God.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.620]   He can't do that to you."
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.620]   But as for the world, well, it is simply lying in his clutches.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.260]   It is simply there lying in his embrace.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.500]   He will never embrace you again.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.540]   The devil, he says, cannot do that to you any longer.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.860]   He is doing it to the others, but no longer to you.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.220]   That evil one toucheth us not.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:09.420]   Now, here is the key to the understanding of this teaching, here at the end of the epistle
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:14.920]   to the Ephesians, as it is the key to the understanding of the Christian life, and the
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:20.260]   whole attitude of the Christian to temptation and sin.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.520]   Have we got it clearly, I wonder?
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.720]   This is what I am saying.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.940]   The Christian is no longer in the clutches of the devil, and he never can be.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:36.380]   He is taken out of the kingdom of Satan altogether, and has been translated into the kingdom of
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.900]   God's dear Son.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.260]   But you see, that doesn't mean that the devil can't worry the Christian.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:50.740]   It doesn't mean that he can't trip him and molest him.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.820]   I wonder whether I'd better try to use again an illustration that I used on some former
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.860]   occasion to try to bring out the essence of this matter, because people seem to be confused
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.660]   by this, and yet there should be no confusion at all.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.940]   Here is the basic position.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:08.860]   The Christian is no longer in the devil's kingdom.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.540]   He is in the kingdom of God.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.700]   He is of God.
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:20.200]   But the devil is still there, and quite clearly the devil worries and denies the Christian
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   a great deal.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.900]   All right, well now, here is the position.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.860]   Whatever the devil may do, he cannot change the position of the Christian.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.420]   That's the act of God, and it's a final act.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.420]   It's an absolute act.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.100]   There is no such thing as falling from grace.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.860]   That would mean the defeat of God again.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.860]   It's impossible.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.420]   There would never be the kingdom of God.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.740]   No one would be saved if that were a possibility.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.460]   There is no such possibility.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.180]   That evil one toucheth us not.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.980]   You'll never get that grasp, that hold of you again.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.260]   It's impossible.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.140]   Well, what can he do?
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.140]   What does he do?
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.460]   Well, this is what he does.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.260]   He annihilates us, I say.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.940]   Let me use my illustration.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:09.140]   Imagine a field on that side, and let the center of this church be a kind of road, and
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.140]   then imagine a field on this side.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.420]   There is the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of the devil, the kingdom of evil.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:20.500]   Here is the kingdom of God, and here is the road in between.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.340]   Now the whole world is there on that side in the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.340]   the devil.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.140]   The children of God are on this side.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.820]   They've been translated, they've been transferred, they've been moved right over by God himself
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.700]   through his Son and the Spirit into his everlasting kingdom.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.640]   And here is the road between them.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.620]   The devil can't get them into his clutches any longer.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.620]   But what can he do?
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.900]   Well, he can do this.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:49.740]   He can't cross that road, and he can't take you back across that road.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.540]   But what he can do is to shout at you across the road.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:31:00.660]   And having been in his clutches, we still know something of his fear and of his power.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.540]   And that is the position of the Christian.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.380]   He is in the kingdom of God, but the devil is walking, as it were, on the hedge on that
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:11.060]   side, shouting at him, interrupting him, laughing at him, suggesting things to him.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:16.340]   And the Christian, in his folly and in his weakness, listens to him, and so he falls
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.340]   into sin.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.580]   Yes, but though he has fallen into sin, he is not back in the clutches of the evil one.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.180]   That evil one toucheth us not.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.380]   He can't embrace us.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.220]   We haven't, we don't go right back again into his arms.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.380]   We are not lying in him.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:36.180]   No, no, he is just influencing the mind, taunting, jeering, mocking, accusing.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:42.900]   Or let me give you another illustration to try and bring out the same truth.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.700]   Imagine a little boy who is afraid of some big bully.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.900]   The bully has often caught him and beaten him and terrorized him.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.640]   One day this little boy is walking down the road with his father, and he is holding his
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   father's hand.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.660]   And of course, the bully to the father is mere nothing.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.980]   The bully is afraid of the father.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.300]   But here is the little boy walking, holding his father's hand.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.320]   Suddenly he sees the bully coming, and he begins to whimper and to cry and to tremble.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.460]   He is terrified and alarmed.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.460]   Why?
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.300]   Well, he is afraid of the bully, his old enemy.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.700]   He has no need to be afraid now, because he is with his father.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.900]   He is perfectly safe.
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.820]   The bully can't touch him.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.180]   And will do nothing to him, because he is afraid of the father.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.220]   And yet the little boy, if he fails to realize this, will be terrorized and will be filled
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.220]   with alarm.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.600]   That's the position of the Christian.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.020]   He is in the hands of God.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.260]   He is of God.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.780]   He is in God's kingdom.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.140]   The devil can't get hold of him and get him back.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.140]   Never.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.140]   Impossible.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.460]   But you see, he can in this way interfere with him.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.460]   He can tempt him.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.620]   He can tantalize him.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.980]   He can harass him.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.980]   He can worry him.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.940]   He can persuade him still to fall into sin.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.320]   But the vital principle that is laid down once and forever is this, that he is no longer
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.340]   in the clutches of the evil one.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.100]   He no longer lies in the evil one.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.900]   He is out of it.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:09.940]   And half the secret of his victory is to realize that this great transformation, this great
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.140]   translation has taken place.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:18.460]   Now let me, therefore, just give you some further scriptural statements to confirm this
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:23.340]   and to establish it in your minds.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.580]   What is the position of the Christian?
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.260]   Well, it's this.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:30.260]   Listen to it in Colossians 3.3.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.100]   You are dead.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:43.340]   And your life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.500]   That's why that evil one toucheth us not.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.500]   How can he?
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.740]   You see, we are not just left on our own.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.940]   What happens to a Christian is not just that he is forgiven and then left where he is.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.940]   Not at all.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   He is dead.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.940]   The man he was is dead.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:02.580]   The old man has been crucified once and forever with Christ.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.140]   You are dead.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:12.660]   And your life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:17.100]   That is why I say again that of all the fatuous teachings that have ever been put to the Church,
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:22.100]   there is none more fatuous than that which teaches the possibility of falling from grace.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.980]   You see, it is as mad as to say this, that the devil can even enter into the presence
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:35.260]   of God and take a Christian out whose life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.220]   Nonsense.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.060]   These are absolute statements.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.860]   There are no opposites and balancing statements to these.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:49.180]   There are some people who try to be so clever, how childish it all is, they don't realize
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:53.160]   that it involves the very character of God himself.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.420]   The Christian is dead, finished with that old life.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.980]   Never again can he be in the clutches of the devil.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:05.420]   His life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.940]   And it is absolutely safe, as safe as God himself.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.700]   Oh, let me give you another statement.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.220]   And again I take you back to the first epistle of John, and this time to the fourth chapter
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.900]   and the fourth verse.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:27.260]   "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them."
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.260]   Why?
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:36.460]   "Because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world."
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:42.700]   There is the same statement again put in a slightly different form.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:52.500]   "You are of God, and because of that you have overcome these antichrists and evil forces
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.500]   and powers."
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   Why?
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:36:02.740]   "Well, because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world."
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:08.820]   It is the devil who is in the man who is in the world.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.580]   Who is the one that is in us?
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:16.140]   Well, it is the Holy Spirit, it is the Lord Jesus Christ, it is God himself.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:21.100]   "We will come unto him and make our abode with him," says Christ.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.080]   And it's true of every Christian.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.540]   Every Christian is of God, and God and Christ and the Spirit are in him.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.260]   Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.860]   It isn't just a man fighting temptation.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   No, no.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.340]   It's the Trinity fighting the devil, and the Trinity is greater.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:45.380]   That's why the Christian's position is secure, and absolutely secure.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:53.220]   In other words, the thing that is to be emphasized always is the absolutely new relationship of
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.500]   the Christian.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.940]   He is in Christ, and Christ is in him.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:06.860]   He's a new man, he's a new creation, he's no longer a child of Adam and liable to that
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.860]   final failure.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.860]   No, no, that's dead.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:16.340]   And the new life is the life of Christ, and he's not only got it, but he's in, incorporated
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.620]   into Christ.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:22.340]   Like the limbs are parts of the body of which Christ is the head, and Christ is in him,
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:27.700]   and the Spirit is in him, and God is in him.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.140]   The Apostle has already been telling us this.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:36.920]   Go back to chapter 4, in verse 16, where he says in verse 15, "But speaking the truth
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:42.420]   in love may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ, from whom
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:48.060]   the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.740]   to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.700]   the edifying of itself in love."
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.700]   What is the church?
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.540]   Well, it's got apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.540]   What for?
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.860]   For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:10.940]   the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and you know, we shall
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.940]   all come.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.100]   There will not be one missing.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.700]   All who belong to God will arrive there in the unity of the faith.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.700]   And to what?
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:26.340]   And to a perfect man, and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.420]   That's it.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.460]   That is the new position of the Christian.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:36.460]   Oh yes, he can be tempted by the devil, even as the Son of God was tempted.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.260]   He was tempted in all points, like us we are, yet without sin.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.540]   He never belonged to that kingdom of darkness.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.460]   He'd never been in the clutches of Satan.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.700]   He never could be, and yet Satan could tempt him and harass him and trouble him and perplex
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.700]   him.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:57.100]   And the position of the Christian is the same, he is in Christ.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.820]   But the fact that he is in Christ doesn't mean that he is immune to temptation.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:09.420]   But thank God, it does mean that he can never again go back into the clutches and the embrace
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:15.900]   of the wicked one who is clutching at and holding and embracing the whole world.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.220]   Very well, what is the result of this?
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.420]   Well, it's this, you see.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:30.180]   It is this absolute certainty and assurance which I am trying to emphasize.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:36.820]   Our Lord had said it in the days of his flesh in John 10, 28, and 29, "I give unto them
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.820]   eternal life, and they shall never perish."
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.820]   Never.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.300]   Now, I'm not saying this.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.740]   John Calvin isn't saying this.
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.380]   It's Christ who's saying it.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.500]   They shall never perish.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.980]   "Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:03.680]   My Father which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.860]   of my Father's hand."
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.580]   Ah, you say, "That's no man.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.580]   That doesn't include the devil."
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.580]   Oh, yes, it does.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.820]   "My Father is greater than all.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.340]   No man includes the devil and hell.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.980]   They shall never perish.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:25.300]   That evil one toucheth them not."
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.400]   You'll never be back in the kingdom of Satan again.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.300]   He'll persuade you, of course, that you will be, and you'll whimper and cry like the little
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.140]   boy holding on to his father.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.500]   But what a fool you are.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.040]   It's because you don't realize the truth, and that's why you listen to the devil and
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.740]   fall into sin.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.740]   Realize your position.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.980]   Let me give you another.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:56.060]   "I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:04.980]   nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature."
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.780]   Is there anything else you can think of?
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.780]   Any other creature.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.460]   The devil, he's there.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.460]   Everything's in there.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:23.500]   "Nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.700]   Jesus, our Lord."
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:31.020]   Oh, that's the difference that the coming of Christ has made.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.300]   He's not merely given me the possibility of salvation.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.440]   He has saved me.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.740]   He has translated me out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.940]   I've been moved.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.340]   I'm no longer in the clutches of the wicked one.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.900]   I'm in God.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:52.300]   We are of God, and we are everlastingly safe.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:57.740]   And you see, it is because of this that the Scripture tells us things like this.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:06.060]   "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.780]   Did you ever hear such a thing?
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:14.740]   The devil, the devil who is so clever and so subtle and so powerful that he could even
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:21.820]   come to man, absolutely perfect and innocent, in the Garden of Eden and get him down.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:26.100]   The devil that defeated, as I say, all the patriarchs and the prophets and the glorious
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.340]   kings of Israel.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:33.500]   The devil that even ventured to attack the Son of God, second only in power to the Blessed
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:40.880]   Trinity, and yet this is what I'm told, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.620]   You'll see nothing but his heels.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:50.500]   Or listen to the Apostle Peter putting the same thing, "Be sober, be vigilant, because
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:56.460]   your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour,
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:01.580]   whom resist, step first in the faith."
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.020]   And if you do that, you've got nothing to fear.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:08.620]   Well, it's simply saying what the Apostle Paul says here, isn't it?
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:13.860]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.720]   Put on the whole armor of God, what for?
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.260]   That you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.940]   You do this, and you'll be able to stand.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:32.380]   "Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:38.580]   the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.900]   That's it.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:45.460]   That's the difference that the coming of Christ has made.
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.340]   It is an absolute difference.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:56.180]   Our whole relationship to the devil has been changed because of our changed relationship
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.580]   to God.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:03.020]   Because we are of God, because we are in the kingdom of God, because we are in Christ,
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:09.380]   and Christ is in us, we can resist him, and he'll flee.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.580]   We can resist him steadfastly in the faith.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:23.900]   He can bring out all his reserves, but we shall be able to stand like men, without fear,
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:32.380]   and triumph over him, and master him, and continue standing.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:55.660]   That evil one toucheth us not because we are of God.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.580]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
