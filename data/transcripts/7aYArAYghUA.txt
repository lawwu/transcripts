[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What were the thresholds that you discovered
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.780]   were important for getting these positive changes
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.900]   such as reduced blood sugar or clearance of blood sugar
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.080]   being more efficient, reduced insulin,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.680]   improved brown fat distribution and density?
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.480]   How much cold exposure do people need?
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.200]   How much heat exposure do people need
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.800]   in order to extract these benefits?
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800]   - Yeah, so when we then calculated the numbers together,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.960]   we could see that this was ended up being 11 minutes
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.120]   in total per week.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.720]   So not in one session, of course,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.400]   but they had two to three visits
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.820]   to the water and the sauna per week.
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.980]   So when we divide that out,
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.080]   it corresponds to being in cold water
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.940]   one to two minutes at a time,
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.920]   but also in the sauna 10 to 15 minutes at a time.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.920]   And I think this is very like also similar
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.880]   to what we see in other studies
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.920]   when we look, for example, to the observational studies
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.240]   from the Finnish cohort study from Lauken et al.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.140]   For example, they published this very amazing paper in 2015.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.480]   Some results from this long cohort study
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.480]   where they show that up to 30 minutes in the sauna
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.880]   was healthy and you lower your risk of cardiovascular disease
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.240]   and that's like the threshold.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.120]   And if you go further than that,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.120]   then there is not more healthy benefits to gain from that.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.920]   So, and before that, it's like 19 minutes,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.720]   then you will have this dose response relationship
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.880]   up to 19 minutes.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.320]   That's really in decreasing your risk
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.360]   of cardiovascular diseases.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.200]   And I think-
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560]   - That's per week, 90 minutes per week.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.200]   - 90 minutes per session now.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.040]   - Per session.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.880]   - Yeah, per session.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.880]   If we then compare that with my study,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.240]   which was 10 to 15 minutes per session,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.680]   then I think it fits very well
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.020]   with what we call the hormetic stress or healthy stress.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.520]   So you expose the cells to this kind of like
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.440]   potent, very stressful situation
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.420]   where they increase heat shock proteins in the cells
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.120]   and that will repair the cells.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.040]   But if you then overdo it
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.640]   and you go beyond the maybe 30 minutes in the sauna,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.460]   this observational study from Finland
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.180]   with more than up to 2000 sauna bathers
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.260]   where they followed these for 20 years,
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.040]   they see that 30 minutes per session is like enough.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.520]   And if you go above that,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.820]   you don't get more health benefits out of it.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.000]   So I think there's a window where we can say
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.460]   the healthy stress corresponds to like 10 minutes.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.300]   And I think it's like-
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.120]   - Per session.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.960]   - Per session.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.880]   And it's not much actually.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.020]   So you don't need to,
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.020]   it shows that you don't have to expose yourself
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.420]   very much to the heat or very much actually to the cold
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.380]   to get this healthy benefits from going into cold,
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.140]   going to heat and have healthy benefits
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.580]   on your cardiovascular system.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.540]   So I think this is very important also message to get out
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.900]   that you don't have to go extreme.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.800]   You don't have to swim for a half an hour in the cold water.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.400]   You can go in the water for one to two minutes per session,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.020]   but go up to 11 minutes per week in total.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.500]   And for the sauna,
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.740]   my study showed 57 minutes in total per week.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.940]   And if we also then divide it out on these two to three days
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.100]   and two sessions each day correspond to 10 to 15 minutes.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.020]   So it's a low threshold,
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.860]   but I think it's good to have that
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.140]   to maybe we can aim for that
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.820]   if people needs to have something to aim for.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.120]   And I think it's really good to have that
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.940]   because then you don't overdo it.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.900]   And if you overdo it, you exhaust the cells
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.940]   and that will increase your risk
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.820]   of cardiovascular disease also, so.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.420]   - Well, I get a lot of questions about this
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.540]   and I did solicit for questions for this podcast on Twitter.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.340]   And one of the questions that I got was
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.460]   as one becomes more cold adapted,
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.140]   do the benefits start to wear off
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.540]   or can people do too much cold exposure?
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.900]   Of course, the answer to that is yes,
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.960]   you can become hypothermic,
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.060]   but I'm sensing a different answer now,
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.620]   which is if I understand correctly,
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.100]   the threshold is 11 minutes total per week
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.460]   of deliberate cold exposure
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.860]   divided into two or three sessions
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.220]   of maybe one to three minutes,
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.300]   depending on how long somebody stays in.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.940]   And then 57 minutes,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.360]   I want to be careful not to round up to an hour,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.060]   but divided into maybe three 20 minute sessions or so,
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.420]   so one doesn't have to be perfect
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.780]   as long as you get beyond that threshold.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.480]   But I wonder something, which is,
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.140]   is it the case that if somebody said,
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.900]   oh, I'm just going to do one 11 minute session per week,
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.580]   that might actually not be as beneficial as dividing it up
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.500]   because what you told us earlier
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.080]   is that the hormetic response
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.060]   depends on having that cold shock.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.220]   You actually don't want to become too cold adapted.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.360]   I mean, once the blood pressure response drops down,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.020]   so in minute four, five and six,
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.700]   you're getting very cold and you're shivering,
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.340]   but one is not getting the autonomic stimulus
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.180]   that they want.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.540]   I guess I could liken this to if exercise worked in a way
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.260]   where it was only the first few minutes of exercise
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.640]   that really triggered the adaptation.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.140]   Of course, this is not how it works,
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.460]   but in fact, probably quite the opposite.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.740]   But if that were the case,
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.460]   then it's not simply the total amount of exercise,
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.780]   but dividing up the sessions into little bouts
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.920]   where every single time it acts as a stimulus.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.720]   That seems to be the key here.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.560]   - This is very important
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.760]   because having watched the landscape of this on social media,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.680]   but also in books and generally,
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.240]   I think you're the first person to really touch on this,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.220]   that the goal is not to get so cold adapted
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.200]   that you can sit in for the full 11 minutes in one session,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   where the goal isn't to be able to do an hour
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.120]   of very hot sauna.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.640]   If you want to, I suppose people could do it
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.480]   for other reasons,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.720]   but if the goal is to improve these health metrics,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.600]   then the idea is to keep the stimulus a stimulus.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.880]   Short, exactly, yeah.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.880]   - Great, well, this also,
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.180]   I think there's practical feasibility, as you pointed out,
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.880]   'cause getting into a cold shower or cold immersion
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.400]   or natural body water for a couple of minutes
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.800]   is far less challenging to most people
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.820]   than finding a full morning to go spend there.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.860]   But I've never really heard it articulated
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.560]   that the longer sessions might not be beneficial
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.660]   and might actually be detrimental.

[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.420]   (upbeat music)
