[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Pastor John, last time you explained why you memorize Scripture, why it's a
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   priority for you, and you challenged us to memorize Romans chapter 8, the whole
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   chapter. Last time you said you wanted to give us some concrete practical
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   suggestions on how to do that, so let's talk about that today. What are some very
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   basic steps that can help us memorize a chapter of Scripture?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   When I was a pastor at Bethlehem, we always began the year with a focus on the
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Word and prayer. And in that week, we'd have a kickoff on Wednesday night, and
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   we'd emphasize Scripture memory. And one of those years, I remember a few years
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   ago, Sam Crabtree, the executive pastor, stood up and he recited the entire
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Sermon on the Mount. It was riveting, because Sam's a good reader anyway. And I
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   remember at one point, he started walking across to the side of the platform as he
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   was beginning Matthew 7, "Judge not that you be not judged, for with the judgment
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   you pronounce you'll be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but don't notice
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   the log that is..." And when he got to the word "log," he had timed it to stand
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   beside one of those massive wooden columns in our sanctuary, and he put out
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   his hand and he said, "Why do you notice the log?" And he put his hand on that just
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   as he was reciting it. I'll never forget that. It was just so amazingly powerful
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   that he was doing the recitation, that he had this picture of a log, you know, 40
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   feet tall, and just massive. So I have had some amazing experiences of people
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   reciting Scripture. John Bloom, the president of Desiring God, recited the
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   entire book of Hebrews from memory as the main message in one of the worship
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   services at his church. And so I've been working on this and believe in it, and I
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   want to help people with some hows here. So here's a suggestion. Andy Davis has
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   written a little booklet. It's online for free in a PDF called "An Approach to
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Extended Memorization of Scripture." And I would recommend everybody look at it,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   but I'll give you the summary of how it helped me here. So if you're going to
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   memorize Romans 8 with me over the next 40 days or so, because there are 39 verses
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   in it, that is a verse a day, I'll show you how I do it. And this is just
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   basically I'm repeating what Andy says, so I give him full credit for these
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   suggestions, and I thank him for inspiring me and helping me. So day one,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   that might be tomorrow for you, day one, you read "There is therefore now no
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." And you read it 10 times. You put
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   your eyes on it and read it 10 times. Now you'll have it memorized before the 10th
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   time, but keep reading it. Don't lift your eyes off it. And look at every different
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   word, because looking is part of fixing it in your brain. Then when the 10 times
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   is done, you close your eyes or shut your Bible and say it from memory 10 times.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I would suggest each time you say it, emphasize a different word. "There is
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ." "There is therefore
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   now no condemnation for those who are in Christ." "There is therefore now no
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   condemnation for those who are in Christ." "There is therefore now no condemnation."
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And as you mention each of those words, new meanings probably will flash before
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   your eyes and fix the word, not only because of its content, but because of the
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   meaning of it in your mind. So when you're done with that, take a few seconds,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   you're done for the day, as far as memorizing Romans 8. Next day, day two, you
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   say that verse 10 times without looking. If you have trouble, you look, get it down,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   and then you go to verse 2, do exactly the same thing. Read it 10 times, close
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   your eyes, say it 10 times, and then say the two together. And same thing day
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   three. Recite verses 1 and 2, and then say the third verse 10 times, I mean read it
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   10 times, then say it 10 times, and right on through 39 times. The trick is going
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   to be staying with it and repeating the long passage. It gets longer every day, so
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   it's going to take more time every day to do this. But it doesn't take a lot of
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   time. I'm setting aside maybe 10-15 minutes a day in the new year to nail down
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   some things that I've worked on in the past and to make some progress. I want to
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   memorize Philippians again. I had it a couple of years ago, and I want to make
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   sure I have it again when I teach on it in the fall. So that's my suggestion. Go to
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Andy Davis's article online, grab it, don't grow weary in this battle. Pray, pray
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   for strength as you begin, and let the Bible talk to you powerfully, and commit
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   to do it. It's just infinitely worth it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Yes, excellent. Thank you, Pastor John. And that booklet by Andy Davis is again
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   titled, "An Approach to Extended Memorization of Scripture." You can search
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   for it online, and you'll find it easily enough. Now this commitment to extended
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Bible memorization requires a lot of time. This is a big commitment, and I think,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Pastor John, this presses forward an important and really an inescapable
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   question about settling on one translation of the Bible. So let's talk about that on
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Monday. Until then, check out the redesigned DesiringGod.org where you can
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   find thousands of books, sermons, articles, and blog posts from John Piper. I'm your
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   host, Tony Reinke. Have a great weekend.
