[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.760]   the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 6 and verse 17, the 17th verse in the 6th
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.640]   chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:27.280]   If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.000]   whether I speak of myself.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.080]   Now in order to remind you again of the context, I'll start reading once more at verse 14.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.600]   Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.000]   And the Jews marveled, saying, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.680]   Jesus answered them and said, "My doctrine, my teaching, is not mine, but his that sent
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.240]   me."
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.640]   If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.400]   whether I speak of myself.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.080]   He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory; but he that seeketh his glory that
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.160]   sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.880]   But as I say, we are concentrating this evening on the 17th verse.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.600]   If any man will do his will, or if you prefer it, if any man willeth to do his will, or
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.560]   again if any man wisheth to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.120]   of God, or whether I speak of myself.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:58.000]   Here, in other words, our Lord is continuing his address to these Jews who had marveled
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   at his preaching in the temple at Jerusalem.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.960]   Our Lord, you remember, had gone up to the Feast of Tabernacles, and halfway through
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.840]   the feast he began to teach in the temple.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.520]   The effect of that was that these Jews, these Jewish authorities, marveled.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.320]   They were amazed at him.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   And yet you remember that instead of reacting to that rightly, as they should have done,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.600]   and going to him and saying, "Well, can you explain to us where you have got this
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   learning from?
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.120]   It is a problem to us.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.800]   We do not understand it."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.880]   Instead of doing that, they dismissed him.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.000]   They treated him with derision.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.440]   They said, "How knoweth this fellow letters, having never learned?"
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.560]   They dismissed him as an outsider.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.740]   He did not belong to their academy.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.880]   And though they had marveled at his teaching, he and his teaching are thus entirely dismissed
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   by them.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.440]   Now, our Lord is concerned about this, and so he takes up the matter.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.520]   And we are looking at it because here is a most extraordinary account given of the very
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.040]   essence of unbelief.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.920]   This is the great tragedy of the New Testament, that though he came to his own, his own received
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.920]   him not.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.280]   There is no greater tragedy than this, that while God has offered everything that we need
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.760]   through the person of his only begotten Son, the world in its need rejects him, turns away
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.160]   from him, dismisses him with scorn, as these people did on this occasion so long ago in
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   Jerusalem.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.120]   Now, our Lord was concerned about this, so he turned to them and he said, "My teaching,
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.720]   my doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me."
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.220]   And as we saw last Sunday night, what he is saying there is that their whole approach
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.360]   to truth is wrong.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.200]   Their whole conception of truth is wrong.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.840]   They think this is some human teaching, and he points out to them that it is not, that
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.240]   it is teaching from God, that it is revelation.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.920]   And their whole manner of trying to approach the truth is wrong.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.000]   They do it with their minds, with their training, with their intellects.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.160]   And that was why they dismissed him, because he lacked that training.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.360]   They said, "Who is this fellow?
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.080]   He has never been to the college, as it were.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.280]   He has never been to school.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.360]   How is this fellow learning, having never learned?"
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:43.880]   So in terms of intellectual pride and academic prejudice, they dismissed him and his teaching.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.560]   And our Lord shows them the complete fallacy that is involved in that particular approach
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.240]   to the truth.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.120]   But that was negative.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.720]   So now he goes on and he puts it to them in a positive manner.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.200]   And that is what we have in this verse that we are looking at tonight.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.640]   He says, "You know, if you really want to know whether this teaching is my teaching
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.400]   only, or whether it is the teaching of God, I can tell you exactly how you can come to
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.040]   a decision.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.280]   You say that this is only my teaching, because it does not correspond to yours.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.720]   I have already told you that it is neither yours nor mine, but that it is from God.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:37.440]   But if and as you still query my statement, well, I can put forward to you a test which
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.960]   will settle this thing once and forever.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:51.800]   If any man wisheth and willeth to do the will of God, he will know for certain whether this
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.640]   teaching is really nothing but a human teaching, my own speculation, or whether it is indeed
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   and truth, teaching revelation which has come from God."
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.880]   Well, now, my dear friends, I need not point out, need I, that we are looking here at the
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.600]   most crucial question that we can ever consider.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.280]   Our position is this.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   Here is the world in its need.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.600]   Here are individuals in their need.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   Here is the extraordinary teaching of this Christian gospel.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.720]   And yet, as I say, the vast majority of people turn away from it.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.400]   We will have nothing to do with it.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.440]   What is the matter with them?
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.640]   What is the cause of this unbelief?
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:55.800]   The answer that is given here is that it is just this question of the wrong approach.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.160]   And because men and women approach it in such an entirely wrong manner, they stumble at
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.600]   difficulties here and there, they remain in their sins, in their miseries, and in their
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:14.280]   sorrows, and they never know the blessings and the glories and the joys of this gospel
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.920]   of the Son of God.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.160]   Very well then, let us see how our Lord puts it positively.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.680]   You do this, he says, and you will know for certain.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.120]   Now then, here is a specific injunction.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.680]   If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.680]   or whether I speak of myself.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.160]   Let me divide this statement up now.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.040]   There are a number of propositions.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.480]   There are three of them as I see it.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.400]   Here is the first.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:57.960]   The true approach to Christian truth is essentially moral rather than intellectual.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.680]   I would assert that that is an obvious proposition which emerges from this statement.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.120]   If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.520]   Very well, I say that Christian truth is to be approached primarily and most essentially
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:19.280]   along moral lines rather than along intellectual lines alone.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.960]   Now as we have already seen, the trouble with these Jews was that their approach was purely
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   intellectual.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.640]   That is why they dismissed him.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.960]   He did not belong to the schools.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.300]   He had not the true learning.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.400]   How could he have?
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.960]   Who was this fellow, this upstart?
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.140]   And so they dismissed him.
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.160]   And what our Lord is really saying to them is this.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.440]   He says, "You do not believe my teaching because you are approaching it in the wrong
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   way.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.640]   You are sizing me up in academic terms.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.640]   You are looking at me in terms of intellectual positions."
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.760]   Now he said, "If only you approached what I am saying in terms of your moral need and
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:01.160]   your moral response to God's law, the whole position would be different."
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.600]   In other words, he accuses them of a kind of hypocrisy.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.640]   They say they are very interested in God and they are concerned to please God and to know
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.800]   and to do God's will.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.840]   He says, "You are not, because if you really were, you would believe my doctrine and you
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.120]   would know that it is a doctrine from God and not my own teaching."
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.720]   Their trouble was that they had intellectualized the whole of religion and the moral element
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:34.680]   was being forgotten, and hence their antagonism to our Lord everywhere in the four Gospels.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.200]   But surely this is still the same.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.960]   The trouble is still this.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.400]   Why are people in trouble about this Christian faith?
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.480]   Why are Christians such a small minority in this country?
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.680]   The answer is that men and women are still approaching it in the wrong manner.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:02.280]   They are approaching it in this purely theoretical and abstract way, which of necessity, according
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:09.400]   to our Lord, leads to a kind of impasse and a complete failure.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.320]   Christianity is regarded as a kind of philosophy, a number of concepts and of teachings and
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.520]   of thoughts, and so people approach it in this purely intellectual, detached, academic
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.720]   and theoretical manner.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.520]   It is a sort of dilettante attitude.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.760]   And that, according to our Lord, is the cause of the whole trouble.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   Now let me illustrate what I mean.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.680]   You talk to anybody who is not a Christian and you say to them, "Now why are you not
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   a Christian?"
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.440]   "Well," they'll say, "you know, there's this question of miracles."
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.560]   They want an argument at once about miracles, how miracles are impossible because of the
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.240]   knowledge that science has given us.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.560]   Now that's arguing about Christianity, they think.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.720]   They're in trouble about these miracles, which are reported here in connection with
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.600]   the life and early ministry of our Lord.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.800]   And they say, "Well, of course, they believed that sort of thing at that time.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   They were governed by magical notions."
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.160]   But we know science has put that sort of thing right out of court.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   Laws of nature.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.320]   There cannot be miracles.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.860]   There are no miracles.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.600]   And so the whole evening is spent in arguing about miracles, the relationship of science
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   and religion.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.360]   That, they think, is the approach to Christianity.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.040]   And then, in the same way, as you know full well, they would argue about the incarnation,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.680]   about the person of our Lord.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.040]   They try to understand the divine and the human, two natures in one person.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.400]   They're trying to dissect the supernatural and the divine.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.960]   They're trying to get it down to the level of their own understanding.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.600]   They say, "Oh, this supernatural talk of yours."
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.480]   They say, "It doesn't fit into our philosophies.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.520]   It doesn't come into our categories."
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.760]   And so the learned discussion goes on purely in the realm of thoughts and concepts and
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.300]   abstractions.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.660]   Everything is theoretical.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.660]   Everything is academic.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.360]   Isn't that how it happens?
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.600]   But then you say there are some who are interested in morality and ethics and behavior.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:12.200]   I agree, but you notice that they also discuss even that in an entirely philosophical and
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   theoretical manner.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.040]   They say, "What is morality?
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.100]   What is the basis of morality?"
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.880]   You listen to them, the brainstressed people and people like that.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.240]   They're very interested in moral concepts and ideas, but the whole thing is delightfully
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   theoretical.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.960]   It's a playing of mind against mind and theory and argument one against another, all up there
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.440]   in the realm of theory and academics.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.560]   Isn't that the position?
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.840]   And that, according to our Lord, is the thing that accounts for the fact that people are
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.640]   not Christian.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.600]   Their whole approach is wrong.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:59.400]   There is no hope of arriving at a knowledge of Christian truth along that particular line.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   He says that there is only one way to approach this truth, there is only one way to know
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.040]   him, there is only one way to understand his teaching.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.400]   It is this.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:19.080]   It is to have within us a deep and a genuine desire to know God.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:25.160]   It is to have within us a deep longing to be holy, to be clean, to be pure.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.040]   If any man wishes to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.520]   You see the difference in the approach?
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.520]   No, no, the man is no longer approaching this whole problem with this academic, theoretical
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   attitude.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.480]   He's not arguing and saying what he thinks God ought to do and not to do and what God
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.240]   is like and what God should not be like.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:50.880]   No, no, the man says, "Here I am in the midst of life in this great world, and I'm
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.040]   troubled about myself.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.640]   I don't even understand myself.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.000]   I don't understand my own life.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.960]   I do things that I shouldn't do.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.760]   I don't do the things that I know that I ought to do.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.040]   Oh, this is my problem.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.960]   It isn't that my little mind may understand the infinite, but isn't there somehow some
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.080]   way whereby a man can be delivered from himself and from his failures?
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.280]   I'm lost in life.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:23.040]   Oh, that I might find God and know him and be enabled to live in a holy and in a worthy
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.040]   man.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.720]   If any man wishes to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine."
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.960]   That's our Lord's teaching.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.240]   In other words, you see, you come down from these great intellectual heights and you start
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.880]   with yourself and your own life and your daily living.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.080]   It's much easier to talk about science and religion than to talk about yourself, isn't
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   it?
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:51.440]   It's much easier to wax eloquent about miracles and about the supernatural and about the incarnation
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.880]   and the atonement than it is just to look at yourself honestly in a mirror and to admit
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.600]   the truth about yourself and really try to discover what's the matter with you and how
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   you can be delivered.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.640]   But that, says our Lord, is the only way.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.480]   You've got to be personal and you've got to be practical.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.640]   This is essentially a moral question.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   This is the approach.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:18.520]   Well, now, you notice that our Lord not only teaches that here, he teaches it everywhere
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.640]   else.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.520]   Did you notice that reading at the beginning out of the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.280]   Did you notice the Beatitudes?
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:36.200]   Here is our Lord laying down the great principles of his kingdom, the kingdom of God.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.120]   Yes, he says, it's the most wonderful thing in life to be a citizen of the kingdom of
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   God.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.720]   Well, what are the characteristics of the citizens of the kingdom of God?
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.360]   Are these brilliant intellects?
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.200]   Are these expert philosophers?
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.040]   Are these people who can bend the magical philosophical terms and talk about science
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.200]   and religion and try and dissect God and show their vast learning?
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.440]   Not the self-confident academician, not the man who is so proud of his learning and who
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.480]   feels that his little mind can encompass the whole universe and speak authoritatively on
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.240]   every question, God and life and death and heaven and hell and everything else.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.520]   Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.080]   You see, it's a quality of being.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.920]   It's a humble man, a man who feels he can't rely on his intellect nor on anything else
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.920]   in himself.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.200]   He is poor in spirit.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.640]   That's how he describes him.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.680]   This is the way into the kingdom.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:51.720]   Blessed are they that mourn.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.280]   What are they mourning about?
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.760]   Oh, they're mourning because of the character of their lives.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.320]   They're mourning because of their failures.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.440]   They see their sins.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.360]   They've taken their resolutions, but they can't keep them.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.560]   They're unhappy because of their moral failure.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.320]   Blessed are they, says our Lord.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.440]   But you see, these clever intellectuals, they don't talk about that.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.240]   Oh, they say, "No, what I don't see is why God, if he's a God of love, should do this
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.040]   and allow that and all this talk of yours about miracles."
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.120]   And there they are in this intellectual realm.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.520]   My dear friend, that's the extreme opposite of the man who enters into the kingdom and
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.800]   who arrives at this knowledge.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.240]   Blessed are they that mourn.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.360]   This is a moral quality.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.840]   Then blessed are the meek.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:46.400]   I have sometimes thought that there is nothing so different from the essentially modern non-Christian
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.840]   men than that.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   Blessed are the meek.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.660]   "Oh, but I'm the twentieth century man.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.500]   Everybody who lived before me was an ignoramus.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.780]   I'm the man who's received the latest results of science, the last events of knowledge."
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:06.220]   The meek is the exact, the self-confident modern who can dismiss God with a wave of
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:12.620]   the hand and spit out Christ out of the corner of his mouth.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.620]   Blessed are the meek.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:22.000]   "Oh, yes, blessed are they that do hunger and thirst."
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   After what?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.980]   After yet greater knowledge, after yet greater understanding, and yet more brilliance.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   Not at all.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:36.280]   "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness."
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.800]   That's the thing to go for.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.100]   "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness."
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.500]   To be like God, who is righteous.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.700]   "They shall be filled."
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.740]   And so on, you notice, with all these beatitudes.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.020]   Let me just select one more.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.900]   Blessed are the pure in heart.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.900]   "They shall see God."
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.740]   You'll never see God with your intellect.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.860]   You'll never see God with your understanding and your mind.
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:15.700]   There's only one way to see God, and it is to be pure in heart.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.300]   Blessed are the pure in heart.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.020]   "They shall see God."
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:29.020]   You notice all along he's saying that the approach is moral, it's not intellectual.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:34.660]   And indeed this teaching is not confined simply to the beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.780]   You remember the surprise that the Apostle Peter got when he was called to the house
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.380]   of a Gentile called Cornelius.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.420]   This man, he says, isn't a Jew, and he felt he shouldn't go and speak to him because he
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:50.240]   was hidebound and tied in by his Jewish notions and conceptions.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.660]   But when he got there and heard what Cornelius had got to say, this is what he said, "Of
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:02.460]   a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.780]   him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him."
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:14.420]   He doesn't say, "Ah, I see that these great thinkers, these people are always expressing
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.820]   their ideas concerning God and their opinions of God and who don't hesitate to criticize
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.660]   God and to say that God is wrong in doing certain things and in allowing others, and
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:26.620]   who criticize the Lord Jesus Christ and put him right and bring him up to date and take
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.340]   things from his teaching and put in others.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.060]   I see that they are accepted."
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.980]   Not at all.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:40.180]   "I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:48.140]   him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:54.100]   Oh, if any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine."
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.060]   You see, the approach is not intellectual.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.940]   The emphasis is not on the intellect ever, but it is always on the total condition of
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:07.900]   the man and especially his longing, his desire for righteousness.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.700]   That's it.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.260]   But you know, this must be genuine.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:18.860]   And here our Lord, I say, is showing that he has seen through these Jewish authorities
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.300]   who talk so much about the law and who could argue so cleverly as to which was the greatest
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.300]   commandment of the law and whether you should tithe mint and rue and anise and cummine and
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.620]   this and that and the other.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.420]   He says you claim to be interested in the law.
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.900]   You are not interested at all in the law.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.900]   You are not honest.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:33.900]   You are not genuine.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.460]   "If any man really willeth to do the will of God, he'll know that my doctrine isn't
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.820]   mine, but God's."
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.340]   You don't know that it's God's.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.340]   Why?
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.380]   Well, because you are not really interested in God's will at all.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:53.660]   You are teaching for commandments the teachings of men.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.840]   You are substituting your own ideas for the law of God.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.500]   That is what he said about these Pharisees everywhere.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.620]   The Apostle Paul says exactly the same thing about them in the Epistle to the Romans.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:12.220]   He says that he has a great weight and heaviness in his heart concerning his fellow countrymen,
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.220]   the Jews.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:18.100]   He said, "I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:24.700]   For they going about," he says, "to establish their own righteousness have not submitted
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.420]   themselves unto the righteousness of God."
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.660]   Yes, it was their own righteousness they were concerned about.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.980]   It wasn't God's righteousness.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.460]   If they'd had a concern about God's righteousness, they would never have crucified their own
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.460]   Messiah.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.100]   But it wasn't God's righteousness.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.620]   It was their own righteousness that they were concerned about.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.340]   They were not really interested in God's will.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:56.140]   They were interested in their own knowledge and in their own reputations and in the good
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.860]   opinion of men and women round about them.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.580]   They walked to their synagogues and they could see the people looking on and saying, "There's
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.580]   the great so-and-so.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.260]   There's this great teacher.
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.940]   There's that marvelous expert."
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:14.340]   And they were proud of it and they made broad their phylacteries.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:20.100]   And the whole time they were only interested in themselves and not interested in God.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.660]   Interested in the praise of men and not interested in the praise of God.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.300]   Well, I say, the same is still the trouble.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.340]   You know, in a sense it was the whole trouble, wasn't it, with that man who is called the
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.780]   rich young ruler?
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.380]   He came to Christ and said, "Good Master, what must I do?"
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.940]   He said, "Well, thou knowest to commend."
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.380]   But he said, "All these have I kept from my youth upwards."
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.100]   "All right," says our Lord to himself, "I'll test him."
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.540]   "Very well," he says, "being that you've done all this, sell all that thou hast and
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:53.620]   give to the poor and come, take up the cross and follow me."
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.380]   And he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.620]   He had great possessions.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.380]   Ah, yes, he was interested as far as it went and as long as it was consistent with his
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.540]   own ideas.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:12.380]   But when our Lord, interpreting the law of God, says, "Do that," he wouldn't do it.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.740]   The law was all right as long as it fitted in with his scheme, his plan, his idea of
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.740]   it.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.580]   But when it asked him to go further, when it asked him to love the Lord, his God, with
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.740]   all his heart and all his soul and all his mind and all his strength, he wouldn't do
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.060]   it.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.980]   And he went away sorrowful.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.740]   My dear friend, this, says our Lord, is the only way in which you'll ever come to know
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.740]   this truth.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.540]   Don't make any mistake about this.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.980]   If you're not a Christian, it isn't because of your intellect.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.500]   That really has got nothing to do with it.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.580]   I think we exploded that last Sunday night.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.860]   I gave you the reasons.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.500]   It isn't your mind.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.500]   I'll tell you your trouble.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   It's moral.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:54.500]   You're not genuinely seeking God.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.620]   You're not really seeking holiness and morality.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.540]   You're really putting up this intellectual camouflage to hide the running sore of your
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.540]   soul.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.740]   You're really not facing yourself at all.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.940]   That's your trouble.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:14.180]   And until you face yourself, you'll always reject this gospel.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.980]   It's not an intellectual matter.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:21.060]   It is essentially a moral matter, our whole attitude towards God.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:26.740]   If you seek him with all your being, says Christ, you'll know that my teaching is his
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.260]   and not my own.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.300]   Very well, there is our first proposition.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:36.140]   Let me hurry to the second.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:45.340]   My second point is this, that that first proposition is true of necessity.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:51.180]   I say that the approach to the gospel is primarily and essentially moral and not intellectual.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:58.620]   Now I'm going to prove to you why that must inevitably be the case.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.180]   Why must it be the case?
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:04.580]   Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:15.020]   Truth, religious truth, is not something theoretical and abstract.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.300]   It is personal.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.300]   What is religion?
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.580]   What, if you like, is theology?
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:31.940]   The very word theology means this knowledge of God, knowledge of God.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.180]   But God isn't an abstraction.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.460]   God is not the absolute.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.020]   God is not the uncaused cause.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.500]   God is a person.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.460]   God is personal.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.900]   God says, "I," and he speaks.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.140]   He talks about himself.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.580]   I am.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.580]   You see, when we're talking about religion and discussing these matters, we are not in
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.740]   the realm of abstract theoretical truth at all.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.820]   We are not like the Greek philosophers discussing goodness, beauty, and truth, which are pure
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.620]   thoughts and ideas in the mind.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.880]   No, no, the moment you become interested in religion and in Christianity in particular,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.780]   you are becoming interested now in a personal.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.740]   God is.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.740]   God exists.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.120]   God has a will.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.660]   God expresses himself.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.900]   Religion is communication and fellowship with God.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.860]   It's a personal relationship.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:38.420]   Now then, that is the first thing that we've got to grasp and to understand.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.040]   Christianity, you know, is not just a question of moral and ethical teaching.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.520]   I know there are many people who give that impression.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.400]   These people who always give the impression that Christianity is nothing but a series
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.600]   of protests.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.800]   I'm going on to repeat this because the newspapers go on printing this sort of thing, protesting
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.480]   about war, protesting about making bombs, protesting about the sentences passed by magistrates.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.760]   "Ah, they say that's Christianity."
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.320]   That is not Christianity.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   I'll tell you what Christianity is.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:13.480]   It is knowing God, being reconciled to him, being in fellowship with him.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.040]   Oh, I know that there is Christian teaching with regard to many subjects, but you know,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.200]   you can have all that and still not be a Christian.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.880]   This is the essence of Christianity.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:32.200]   This is life eternal, says our Lord, that they might know thee, the only true God and
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.920]   Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.800]   God is a person and he's told us that he calls himself the Father.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.400]   He sent his Son and the Son said, "Whosoever hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.720]   Don't think of God in abstract terms.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.520]   He's a person.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.500]   And that is why I say the approach along the line of this truth is never to be merely theoretical
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.880]   and academic and abstract and intellectual, but must always be moral.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   Why?
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:09.080]   Because God is not only personal, but because of the nature of God.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:13.620]   This is what is so appalling about the way in which men speak about religion and about
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.480]   God and about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:22.560]   If only they knew what they were doing and what they were saying.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.960]   And you heard people criticizing God and saying this and that and cursing.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.240]   Oh, if they but had a glimpse of him and knew what they were talking about.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:39.720]   God, my dear friend, oh, if men only knew something about his greatness.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:47.160]   He is from eternity to eternity, without beginning or end of days.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.520]   He is the creator of the whole universe.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.720]   He is endless in his power.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.880]   He is present everywhere.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.800]   He knows everything.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.880]   God is.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:06.960]   And there is no limit in any sense upon him and his being and his glory.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.840]   And he is holy.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:25.000]   He dwelleth in a light which is unapproachable, whom no man hath ever seen or can see.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.240]   He is in the burning light, our God is a consuming fire.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.200]   Can you approach such a being with your mind and intellect?
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.760]   Can you take up the attitude and say, well now I am going to investigate God.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.080]   I am just going to see whether all this that God has said about himself is really right
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   or true or not.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.400]   And I am going to examine.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.480]   So you put your specimen on the table.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:57.760]   Oh benighted fool, the God in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways, that
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.640]   is the one you are speaking about.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:08.120]   There is only one way to approach such a being.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.600]   It was the very way that he indicated to his own servant Moses long ago.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.840]   Moses was a shepherd, you remember, in a desert and he took the sheep one day to the backside
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.600]   of a mountain and there quite casually he looked and he saw a burning bush, a bush aflame
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.880]   with fire.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.280]   And Moses thought what an interesting phenomenon.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.240]   This is interesting, I will draw aside and have a look at this.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.920]   And he was walking towards it when suddenly a voice came out and said, take off thy shoes
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.280]   from off thy feet.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:43.600]   For the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:49.280]   God is not to be examined, God is not to be investigated, God is not to be scrutinized
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.440]   and weighed and measured and assessed by our minds and our intellects.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:59.800]   Oh the blasphemy of it, oh the folly of it, oh the monstrosity, the imbecility of it all.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.600]   God because he is who and what he is, is to be worshipped.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.960]   Take off thy shoes from off thy feet.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.800]   God is to be obeyed, God has revealed himself in his law.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:24.200]   He knows all, he sees all, he knows our very inward parts and he desires truth in our inward
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   parts.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.440]   He can have no fellowship with evil, he can't have any dealings with sin, he is everlastingly
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.720]   holy, he is eternal light.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.160]   How can he have fellowship with that which is evil?
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.800]   There is no communion between light and darkness, between God and Belial, there cannot be.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:48.560]   The character of God makes it eternally impossible.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.240]   And then this becomes still more obvious when I point out this.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.320]   I say that the fact that God is personal and that God is holy and righteous and so great
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:04.680]   in his glory makes it essential that the approach should be moral and then I add that it becomes
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:11.880]   much more obvious and essential when we consider the nature of man in sin, when we consider
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.360]   what you and I are.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.840]   You see man is not a pure intellect in a kind of vacuum.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.260]   Man, every one of us is a very strange amalgam.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.960]   We are mind and heart and will.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   Oh yes, but we are many other things also.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:34.800]   There is this body and there are lusts and passions and desires and we are sinners, we
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.320]   are a fallen race.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:42.840]   Even if our minds were absolutely pure and clean, we couldn't encompass God and it would
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:48.120]   be folly to try to understand him with the mind, even if we were perfect.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.040]   But we are not perfect.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.760]   We are a mass of prejudices.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.320]   We never start with an open mind.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.240]   Every time we express an opinion we are defending ourselves.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.560]   We start with a bias.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   We are against the truth.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.480]   A man says, "Oh, but I'm an open-minded man.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.320]   I've got the scientific, the modern scientific attitude."
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.520]   My dear friends, have you ever met scientists and talked to them?
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.440]   They're as prejudiced as the rest of us.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.320]   They've got schools amongst themselves.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.600]   They're jealous of one another.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   I had a little scientific training, you know, and I knew some of them.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.460]   They hated one another.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.860]   They really hated one another.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.680]   And they hated them because of reputation.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.520]   A scientist is only a man.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.160]   He can't isolate himself nor isolate his intellect.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.400]   No, no, we're all governed by these things.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.560]   Man has a free mind, we are told.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.160]   Free mind and free thought, it's a complete impossibility.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.400]   Listen to the words of the Son of God.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.160]   This is the condemnation.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.760]   That light is coming to the world.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.480]   Oh, why doesn't everybody believe it?
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:35:01.200]   And men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.600]   Is man readied with an open mind to consider the light?
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.600]   Not at all.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   The moment that light flashes on him, he knows what it's doing.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.160]   It's revealing his sinfulness.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.440]   It's revealing his evil, and he doesn't like that.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.440]   He wants to protect himself.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   He says, "This isn't true.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.440]   Who is this fellow?
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.200]   Are you asking me to believe something that was taught 2,000 years ago?
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.600]   They have not the knowledge we've got.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.320]   Who is this fellow that you're asking us to believe in?"
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.320]   It's impossible.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.320]   But that is, you see, because he disturbs us, isn't it?
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.360]   Well, he said it all in the seventh verse of the very chapter that we are considering
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.360]   together.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:36.280]   He said, "The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, because I testify of it that
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.800]   the works are evil."
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.360]   The trouble about Christianity is not that it talks about miracles, but that it talks
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   about you.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.800]   And because it exposes you as you are, and looks at you in your sin and shame and your
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.360]   meanness and your pettiness and your spite and your jealousy and your envy, and puts
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.640]   it all on the surface, and you hate it for that reason.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:04.040]   Men love darkness and hate the light.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:10.800]   That is why it is supreme nonsense to think that you can ever arrive at a knowledge of
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.560]   Christian truth by means of your intellect alone.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.760]   No, no.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.040]   We call in the intellect to defend us against the searching light of God.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:27.000]   Eternal light, eternal light, how pure the soul must be that placed within thy searching
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   sight.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.160]   It shrinks not, but with calm delight can live and look on thee.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.680]   It can't be done.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.660]   And we hate that, and so we put up our defenses.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.720]   We erect the intellectual camouflage.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.760]   It's nothing but self-defense, guarding the prejudice, trying to get rid of the uncomfortable
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.760]   feeling.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.800]   The gospel of Jesus Christ isn't interested in your opinions.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:54.840]   It's interested in your life and what you're making of it.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.000]   How would you feel if all the sins you've committed only today could be put up on a
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.400]   screen at the back of the pulpit here?
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.640]   How would you like the whole of your life to be read in an open book?
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:12.920]   That's what it's interested in, your failure, your moral being, your moral iniquity.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:20.920]   So I say our Lord's proposition is inevitable, because we are what we are, and because God
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:26.520]   is who and what he is, the only approach that is possible is a moral one.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.140]   Very well, that brings me to my third and my last point.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.480]   It is this.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:39.480]   I am now going to show you why this moral approach, if it's genuine, inevitably leads
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:48.280]   to an acceptance of the truth, a recognition of him, and an embracing of his wonderful
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.640]   offer of salvation.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:54.800]   I say it is inevitable, if you and I really approach it on the moral level.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   Listen to him.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:07.320]   "If any man wisheth, really wills to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.360]   Whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself."
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.440]   I want to prove this to you.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   Why I say does it follow of necessity that if a man really wants to know God, and really
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:26.400]   wants to be holy, and clean, and pure, and upright, and just, and righteous, he will
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.960]   soon know that this is the truth of God.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   How does it work?
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:36.400]   It works like this.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:49.600]   If you genuinely and truly set out to seek God, really to find him and to know him, really
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:59.560]   to love him and to worship him, if you really set out to do that, you will very soon discover
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.000]   that you can't do it.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.440]   You read the lives of men who have tried before you, greater men than any one of us in this
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.920]   meeting tonight, some of the greatest men that the world has ever known.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:24.400]   They set out in the quest to find God, to know him, and really to love him.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.060]   But they discovered that they couldn't do it.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:32.640]   They completely failed.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.600]   Another thing that such a man discovers is this.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:42.120]   He discovers, as I've been saying, that he is sinful, that he is vile.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.720]   Now, my terms are not too strong.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.400]   Charles Wesley says, "Just and holy is thy name.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.120]   I am all unrighteousness.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.240]   Vile and full of sin I am."
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.560]   How did he discover that?
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.080]   Oh, he discovered that by drawing near unto God.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.720]   You try it as an experiment.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.680]   Spend a week reading nothing but this book.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:15.080]   Spend your time in seeking God and in trying to live a pure and a clean and a holy life,
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.680]   and you'll be amazed at what you'll discover in yourself.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.160]   You'll discover evil, foul thoughts and imaginations.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.640]   You'll find unworthy desires.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.320]   You'll find bitter, cruel, harsh, envious feelings.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.240]   You'll find that you're a mass of iniquity.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.680]   Every man who's ever tried it has always come to that conclusion.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.640]   "Vile and full of sin I am."
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.160]   That's what you'll discover.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.040]   And then a man who makes this genuine and real quest for God and the knowledge of him
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:53.600]   and fellowship with him and the holy life, he soon discovers this, that not only is he
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:41:01.320]   a sinner, but that he has sinned grievously against God, and that he is under the wrath
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.720]   of God, that he is guilty before God.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.880]   He will discover that the apostle Paul was saying nothing but the simple truth about
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.120]   him when he said, "There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.680]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.360]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God."
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.560]   You will find that you're a guilty sinner, not only a vile one, but a guilty one, and
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.000]   that God cannot possibly have dealings with you.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.480]   You're amazed that you're still alive, that he hasn't blotted you out of existence,
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:34.080]   guilty under the wrath of a holy God, lost.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.760]   And now you begin to feel desperate.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   You say, "What can I do?
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.920]   Where can I turn?
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.080]   I can't find my way, but the world can't.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.080]   I turn to the philosophers.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.280]   I've already tried them.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   They don't know.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.680]   Nobody can help me.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.320]   Everybody's a sinner.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   Everybody's lost."
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.920]   And here you are in the world and you're lost.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.080]   You try to improve yourself and you find you can't improve yourself, because the more
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.480]   you try, the worse you discover yourself to be.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.320]   And you become depressed and anxious, and that makes you worse.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.040]   And on it goes in the vicious circle.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.880]   You can't make yourself better.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.880]   Men have tried it.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.560]   Luther tried it before his conversion.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   Wesley tried it.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.840]   All the saints have tried it.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.840]   You can't do it.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.160]   You'll discover that.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.320]   And then you'll begin to discover that time is passing.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.480]   The days and the weeks and the months and the years are fleeting by, and you're getting
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.600]   older, and somebody dear to you dies, and you say, "Well, I've got to die.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.560]   How does a man die?
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.720]   How can I lie on my deathbed without fear?
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.640]   How can I face death, what lies beyond?"
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.200]   And you discover that you don't know how to die.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.440]   A man who really seeks to do the will of God discovers that.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.040]   He doesn't know how to die.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:53.520]   In other words, this is what he discovers, that his greatest need is not further intellectual
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.440]   and philosophical understanding.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.920]   He's long since forgotten all that.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.320]   He isn't waiting for the latest wonderful book to come, or that brilliant lecture that
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.400]   the great philosopher is going to give on the wireless.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   No, no.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.960]   He says, "No, no, my need is this.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.680]   I need forgiveness.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.800]   I need something to be done about my past sins.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.000]   They're rising against me.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.800]   I want to erase the blots out of my copybook of life.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.080]   I can't get rid of it, my past.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.160]   What can I do with this?
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.760]   I need to be forgiven."
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.480]   He's forgotten his mind.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.880]   He's just a guilty sinner.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.160]   He's been seeking to do the will of God.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.640]   He needs forgiveness.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:42.880]   He feels he needs a new nature, that he must be made anew from beginning to end, that he's
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.520]   so bad he can't be improved.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.280]   He says, "I need a complete renovation.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.640]   I want a nature that loves the light and hates the darkness, instead of hating the light
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.160]   and loving the darkness."
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:01.640]   And then he realizes his need of a power that will enable him to overcome sin and temptation.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.800]   The world and the flesh and the devil will still be there.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   And how can he overcome them?
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   How can he stand?
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   He's always falling.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.640]   He needs power and strength and might.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.720]   Where can he find them?
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:27.080]   A man who really wills and wishes to do the will of God arrives at those conclusions.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.880]   And what our Lord is saying is this.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:36.640]   A man who has arrived at those conclusions is a man who is going to jump at my teaching
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.880]   with both hands and is going to thank God for it and is going to say, "This must be
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   from God.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.700]   It and it alone meets my every need."
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.700]   What does it mean?
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.000]   It means this.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.120]   He starts, you see, by saying, "I'd like to know God.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.760]   Oh, that I might know God.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.960]   Oh, that I might know where I might find him.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.280]   I can't find him.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   My mind is too small.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   It's warped.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   It's sinful.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   No man can find him.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   No man has seen him.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   Knowledge of God.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.040]   Where can I find it?"
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:12.200]   And then he meets this person who says, "No man hath ascended unto heaven.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.000]   It's impossible.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.440]   The highest ladders known to men, rockets fired from the top of them, can't reach heaven.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:32.440]   No man ascendeth unto heaven, nor ever can, except the Son of God who is in heaven."
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:39.320]   This man who is speaking of old there in Galilee who says, "I have come down from God.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.520]   I have descended from heaven.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.320]   Here is one who can give me knowledge of God.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.320]   He knows him.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.760]   He has come out of his bosom.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.320]   He is his only begotten.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.600]   He is his beloved.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.240]   He is his eternal Son.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.440]   Here is not a man repeating what he has been told.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.080]   He speaks as an eyewitness.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.840]   He was face to face with God and he has come down amongst us.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.640]   He has declared God.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.640]   He answers my first great need.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.320]   Here is teaching come from God."
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:18.320]   And then I say that I have discovered that I am lost and forlorn.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.960]   I am weary and sick and sad.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.200]   I am tired and at the end of my tether I don't know where I am.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   I am lost.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:35.080]   And then I hear a voice coming to me and saying, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.360]   that which is lost.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.680]   Thank God.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.200]   This must be a teaching come from God.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.720]   Oh yes, I am sinful.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.840]   I am vile."
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:53.720]   I hear the voice saying to me again, "I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.080]   They that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.480]   And I am terribly sick.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.320]   I am morally sick.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   I am vile.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   I am a sinner.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.320]   I am unclean."
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.080]   He says, "I have come for such.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   Thank God.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.600]   This must be a voice from God.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.240]   No man speaks like that."
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:19.320]   And then I need forgiveness and pardon.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.800]   And I cannot see anywhere whereby I can find it, I feel, that God cannot forgive me.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.800]   I have ignored him.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   I have blasphemed him.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.040]   I have disobeyed him.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.960]   I have put my will before his.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   And the things I have done, they are there.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.560]   I have done what I have done.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.480]   I have written what I have written.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   How can I?
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.720]   How can God forgive me?
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.240]   I feel it is impossible.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:50.080]   And I look at this same person and I hear him saying one afternoon, "The Son of Man
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:48:04.240]   is come not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.360]   I look at him on the cross and this is what I find.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   I find there that here is a way whereby the righteous, holy, and just God can forgive
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:20.600]   me for he hath laid on him my iniquity.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:26.000]   He is just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.400]   He has punished my sin as he said he would and yet because he has punished it in another,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.640]   he can forgive me.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   Here is the only way, here is the only teaching that reconciles the justice and the love of
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.480]   God, the righteousness, the holiness, and the compassion and the mercy.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.800]   And it is here alone.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:52.840]   This must be a teaching come from God.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:57.320]   I see a way now of pardon and forgiveness but I need a new nature.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   Where can I have it?
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:07.600]   I listen to him again and he says, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, ye must be born again.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:13.240]   I am come that they might have life," not intellectual knowledge, that isn't what they
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:23.840]   need, life, "and that they might have it more abundantly.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.920]   I need strength and power."
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:36.760]   And I hear him saying that he is going to send the Holy Spirit to be another comforter,
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:43.480]   to be at my side, my advocate, my help, my strength, my power, that he will make me more
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   than conqueror.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:50.480]   He answers this need and finally death itself.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:56.680]   He has conquered it, he has gone through it and emerged the other side.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:04.260]   By his glorious resurrection he has vanquished the last enemy.
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:11.800]   He has taken the terror out of death and the grave and he has opened the gate of heaven
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:20.280]   and the door into the presence of his heavenly Father.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:28.800]   You approach these questions along the line of your moral need and you will inevitably
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.840]   come to the conclusions that I have enumerated and you will see that the teaching of the
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.160]   Lord Jesus Christ answers every one of them.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.200]   I defy you to think of a single question but that he hasn't answered it already.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.520]   He satisfies completely.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:47.640]   As somebody said when he was here on earth, "He doeth all things well."
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:53.680]   He does them perfectly.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:00.000]   Are you a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.360]   Do you believe in him as the Son of God and the Savior of your soul?
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:14.320]   Have you believed his teaching?
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:22.680]   If you haven't, it is because of your appalling ignorance of God.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:27.640]   It is because of your appalling ignorance of yourself.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.080]   It is because of your appalling ignorance of what death means.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.600]   It is because of your appalling ignorance of what is going to happen to you after you
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:41.480]   have died and as you stand before God in the judgment.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.040]   It has nothing to do with your intellect at all.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.040]   Nothing.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:53.680]   Your intellect is no greater nor bigger than that of many of us who are Christians.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.960]   Nothing to do with intellect.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:05.480]   It is that you have never faced your moral condition, your exceeding sinfulness, your
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:16.760]   desperate wickedness, your lost condition in the sight of that holy God.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:23.200]   It is because you have never realized that if you die like that, you will spend eternity
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:32.080]   in misery, unhappiness, self-accusation, realizing the folly of having refused the Son of God
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.560]   and his glorious free salvation.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.680]   It is because you don't know that.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   That is the explanation.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.080]   Well I leave you with a challenge.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:59.280]   If any man really and honestly and genuinely wills and wishes to do the will of God, you
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:07.840]   will very soon fly to Jesus Christ just as you are without a single plea.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.000]   With all your doubts and fears and everything else, you will be so desperate, you will fly
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   to him.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.200]   You will turn to him and say, "Wash me, Savior, ere I die.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.240]   Let me hide myself in thee.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.560]   I believe thy teaching.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   It is beyond me.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.600]   My mind is too small and puny and sinful.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.200]   I believe thy word."
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:32.040]   You will fall at his feet and say, "Receive me and blessed be his name."
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:39.920]   Though in our arrogant blasphemy and our intellectual pride and folly we have criticized him and
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:45.000]   rejected him so long, he will not refuse us.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.720]   He will still receive.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:56.760]   For he has said, "Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out."
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:02.440]   Be genuine, be honest, face the moral need.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:10.920]   And you will go to him and he will shower upon you the blessings of salvation.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.800]   Amen.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.720]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
